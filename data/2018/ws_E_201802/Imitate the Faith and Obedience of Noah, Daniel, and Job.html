<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What were some of Noah’s challenges, and what was amazing about him?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>What were some of Noah’s challenges? </strong>In the time of Noah’s great-grandfather Enoch, people were already very wicked. They said “shocking things” about Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) The world then became more and more violent. By Noah’s time, “the earth was filled with violence.” Wicked angels came to earth, made human bodies for themselves, and married women. Their sons were cruel and violent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:2-1:6:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) But everyone could see that Noah was different. The Bible says that “Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.” Unlike the people around him, he did what was right. “Noah walked with the true God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:8-1:6:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 6:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What do those words tell us about Noah? First, think about how long Noah served Jehovah faithfully in that wicked world before the Flood came. It was not just for 70 or 80 years but for almost 600 years! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 7:11</a>) Second, remember that he did not have a congregation to help and encourage him as we have today. It seems that not even his brothers and sisters supported him.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—See footnote.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How did Noah show great courage?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Noah did not think that it was enough just to be a good person. He boldly told others about his faith in Jehovah. The Bible calls him “a preacher of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:5</a>) The apostle Paul said about Noah: “Through this faith he condemned the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:7</a>) No doubt people made fun of him and tried to stop him. Perhaps they even threatened to hurt him. But Noah was not afraid of people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>) Rather, he had faith, so Jehovah gave him courage. And he gives the same courage to all his faithful servants today.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What challenges did Noah have when he built the ark?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Noah had already been faithful to <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Jehovah for more than 500 years when Jehovah told him to build a large ark. It would be used to save some people and animals from the Flood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:32-1:5:32" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6:14</a>) Building such a huge ark must have seemed very difficult to Noah. And he surely knew that people would mock him even more and make his life very difficult. But Noah had faith and obeyed Jehovah. “He did just so.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:22-1:6:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 6:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did Noah trust in Jehovah to provide for his family?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Noah had another challenge. He had to provide for his wife and children. Before the Flood, people had to work extra hard to grow food. Noah did too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:28-1:5:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 5:28, 29</a>) Yet, he did not let the needs of his family become his biggest worry. Serving Jehovah was always most important in his life. Even though Noah was busy building the ark for perhaps 40 or 50 years, he remained focused on Jehovah. And he did that for another 350 years after the Flood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:28-1:9:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 9:28</a>) Noah was a fine example of faith and obedience!</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) How can we imitate Noah’s faith and obedience? (b) If you are determined to obey God’s laws, of what can you be sure?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>How can we imitate Noah’s faith and obedience? </strong>We do this when we defend Jehovah’s view of what is right, when we are no part of Satan’s world, and when we put Jehovah first. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> John 15:19</a>) Of course, for those reasons, the world does not like us. For example, because we are determined to obey God’s laws about sex and marriage, people may say negative things about us in the media. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:17-39:3:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Malachi 3:17, 18</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Like Noah, we are not afraid of people. We fear Jehovah, that is, we have deep respect for him and do not want to disappoint him. We know that he is the only One who can give us everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:4-42:12:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 12:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Ask yourself: ‘Will I keep doing what is right in God’s eyes, even when others make fun of me or criticize me? Do I trust that Jehovah can provide for my family, even when it is hard to make a living?’ If you trust in Jehovah and obey him as Noah did, you can be sure that Jehovah will take care of you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What big challenges did Daniel and his three friends have in Babylon? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>What were some of Daniel’s challenges? </strong>Daniel was forced to live in Babylon, a foreign city that was full of false gods and spiritism. People there disliked the Jews and mocked them and their God, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 137:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:3-19:137:3" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 3</a>) This must have greatly hurt Daniel and other Jews who loved Jehovah! Also, many people were closely watching Daniel and his three friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah because they were going to be trained to work for the king of Babylon. They were expected to eat the king’s food, which included things that Jehovah did not want his people to eat. But Daniel did not “defile himself with the king’s delicacies.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:5-27:1:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Daniel 1:5-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:14-27:1:17" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 14-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Daniel had another challenge, which at first might not have looked so difficult. He was very capable, and because of that, the king gave him special privileges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:19-27:1:20" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 1:19, 20</a>) Still, Daniel did not become proud or think that his opinion was always right. He remained humble and modest. He always said that Jehovah was the reason for his success. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:30-27:2:30" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 2:30</a>) Just think: Jehovah mentioned Daniel along with Noah and Job as a good example to follow. At that time, Noah and Job had already served Jehovah faithfully all their lives, but Daniel was still a young man. Jehovah truly had confidence in Daniel! And rightfully so, because Daniel stayed faithful and obedient to God all his life. When Daniel was almost 100 years old, God’s angel said these kind words to him: “O Daniel, you very precious man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:11-27:10:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Daniel 10:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What could be one reason why Jehovah helped Daniel to get a high position?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Because of Jehovah’s support, Daniel became a very important official, first in the Babylonian Empire and then in the Medo-Persian Empire.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>16, 17. </strong>What challenges did Job have at different times of his life?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup>What were some of Job’s challenges? </strong>Job went through big changes in his life. At first, Job was “the greatest of all the people of the East.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:3-18:1:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 1:3</a>) He was very rich, and many people knew him and highly respected him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:7-18:29:16" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Job 29:7-16</a>) Despite this, Job did not think that he was better than others or feel that he did not need God. We know this because Jehovah called him “my servant” and said about him: “He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Suddenly, though, Job’s life changed completely. He lost everything, and he became so depressed that he wanted to die. Today, we know that it was Satan who caused Job’s problems. He said that Job served Jehovah only for selfish reasons. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b"><strong>Job 1:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah took this wicked accusation very seriously. What would he do to show that Satan is a wicked liar? He gave Job the opportunity to prove his loyalty to God and to show that he served him out of love.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>(a) What impresses you about Job? (b) What do we learn about Jehovah from the way he treated Job?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Satan viciously attacked Job over and over again and made him think that these attacks were coming from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:13-18:1:21" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 1:13-21</a>) Then three men who claimed to be Job’s friends said cruel things to Job. They said that he was wicked and that God was punishing him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:1-18:22:1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 22:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:5-18:22:10" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 5-10</a>) Despite all of this, Job remained loyal to Jehovah. It is true that Job sometimes said foolish things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:1-18:6:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Job 6:1-3</a>) But Jehovah understood that Job did this only because he was hurt and depressed. Jehovah saw that Job never abandoned him, even though Satan, like a big bully, attacked and insulted Job again and again. After this terrible situation ended, Jehovah gave Job double what he had before and 140 more years of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="42-1" class="b">James 5:11</a>) During that time, Job continued to serve God with all his <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>heart. How do we know that? Because <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ezekiel 14:14</a>, our theme text, was written hundreds of years after Job died.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup>How can we imitate Job’s faith and obedience? </strong>No matter what our circumstances are, we want to make sure that Jehovah is always the most important Person in our life. We want to trust in him completely and obey him with all our heart. In fact, we have even more reasons to do so than Job had. Think about what we know today. We know a lot about Satan and his methods. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) Because of the Bible, especially the book of Job, we know why God allows suffering.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>) And we know that this Kingdom will soon rule over the whole earth and end all suffering.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Job’s experience also teaches us to show compassion when our brothers are suffering.

Their experiences remind us of what the apostle Peter said: “After you have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved kindness . . . will himself finish your training. He will make you firm, he will make you strong, he will firmly ground you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>The words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a> are also true for God’s people today. Jehovah assures us that he will make his servants firm and strong. We all want Jehovah to make us strong, and we want to remain firm and stay faithful to him. That is why we want to imitate the faith and obedience of Noah, Daniel, and Job. In the next article, we will learn that these men were able to remain faithful to Jehovah because they really knew him. In fact, they were able to “understand everything” that he wanted them to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:5-20:28:5" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:5</a>) And we can do the same.</p>

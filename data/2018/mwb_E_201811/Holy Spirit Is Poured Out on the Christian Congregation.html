<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">Many Jews who were present in Jerusalem during Pentecost 33 C.E. came from other nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:9-44:2:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 2:9-11</a>) Although they observed the Mosaic Law, they may have lived in a foreign land their entire life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:44:1-24:44:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer 44:1</a>) Therefore, some may have looked and talked more like the natives of their country than like the Jews. When 3,000 from this multinational crowd got baptized, the Christian congregation suddenly became much more diverse. Despite their different backgrounds, “they were in constant attendance in the temple with a united purpose.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:46-44:2:46" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 2:46</a>.</p>

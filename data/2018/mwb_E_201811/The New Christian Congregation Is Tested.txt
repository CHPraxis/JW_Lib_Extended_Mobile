TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 6-8
The New Christian Congregation Is Tested




6:1-7; 7:58–8:1
Newly baptized Greek-speaking widows who had lengthened their visit to Jerusalem were being discriminated against. Did this injustice stumble them, or did they patiently wait on Jehovah to correct matters?
After Stephen was stoned and intense persecution caused Christians in Jerusalem to scatter throughout Judea and Samaria, did they slow down in their ministry?
With Jehovah’s backing, the new Christian congregation endured and flourished.​—Ac 6:7; 8:4.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How am I dealing with trials?’

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOHN 20-21
“Do You Love Me More Than These?”




21:1-19
In Bible times, successful fishermen were patient, hardworking, and willing to endure hardship in the pursuit of a worthwhile reward. (w12 8/1 18-20) Such qualities would serve Peter well as a fisher of men. However, Peter needed to decide what he would put first in his life​—a secular career that he enjoyed or the work of spiritually feeding Jesus’ followers.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Skillfully Use the Tools in Our Teaching Toolbox









Making a disciple is like building a house. To build effectively, we must learn to use our tools well. We especially need to develop skill in using our principal tool, God’s Word. (2Ti 2:15) We also need to make effective use of the other publications and videos in our Teaching Toolbox​—with the goal of making disciples.a
How can you improve in using the tools in our Teaching Toolbox? (1) Ask your field service group overseer for help, (2) work with an experienced publisher or pioneer, and (3) practice, practice, practice. As you become skilled at using these publications and videos, you will experience joy in the spiritual building work now taking place.

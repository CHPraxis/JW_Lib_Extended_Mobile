LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Preaching and Teaching​—Essential to Making Disciples




Jesus commanded his followers to go and make disciples. (Mt 28:19) This involves preaching and teaching. From time to time, we should all ask ourselves, ‘How can I improve in these essential aspects of the disciple-making work?’



PREACHING

Instead of waiting for people to come to us, we must actively search for “deserving” ones. (Mt 10:11) When we share in the ministry, are we alert to opportunities to speak with people who ‘happen to be on hand’? (Ac 17:17) Lydia became a disciple as a result of the apostle Paul’s diligent preaching.​—Ac 16:13-15.





“Sow your seed in the morning and do not let your hand rest until the evening” (Ec 11:6)

TEACHING

To make disciples, we must do more than simply leave literature with people. To help them progress spiritually, we need to make return visits and conduct Bible studies. (1Co 3:6-9) Yet, what if our diligent efforts to teach someone Kingdom truth yield little results? (Mt 13:19-22) We should continue our search for those whose hearts are like “fine soil.”​—Mt 13:23; Ac 13:48.

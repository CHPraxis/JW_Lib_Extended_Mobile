DID YOU KNOW?
Although the Passover did not foreshadow the Memorial, certain features of the Passover have meaning for us. For example, the apostle Paul called Jesus “our Passover lamb.” (1Co 5:7) Just as the lamb’s blood on the doorframes saved lives, Jesus’ blood saves lives. (Ex 12:12, 13) Also, not a bone of the Passover lamb was broken. Similarly, Jesus did not have any of his bones broken, even though this was a custom at such executions.​—Ex 12:46; Joh 19:31-33, 36.

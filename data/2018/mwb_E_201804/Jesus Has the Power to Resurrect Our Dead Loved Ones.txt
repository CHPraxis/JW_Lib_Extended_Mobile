TREASURES FROM GODâ€™S WORD | MARK 5-6
Jesus Has the Power to Resurrect Our Dead Loved Ones




5:38-42





  The grief we feel when a loved one dies does not mean that we lack faith in the resurrection (Ge 23:2)

  Meditating on Bible accounts of resurrections will strengthen our faith in the future resurrection


Whom do you look forward to welcoming back in the resurrection?
How do you picture the reunion?

Expressed With Conviction








1 Thessalonians 1:5

SUMMARY: Show that you firmly believe in the truth and the importance of what you are saying.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Prepare thoroughly. Study the material until you understand how the Scriptural arguments can lead to one logical conclusion. Try to express the main points of your presentation in a few simple words. Concentrate on its value to your listeners. Pray for holy spirit.





Practice your presentation aloud to become fully acquainted with your material and to improve your delivery.



  Use words that convey conviction. Rather than repeating the exact wording of published material, use your own words. Choose language that shows you are certain of what you are saying.

  Express yourself earnestly and sincerely. Speak with sufficient volume. Where it is not offensive to do so, maintain eye contact with your listeners.





Do not confuse expressing conviction with being tactless, opinionated, or pushy. Even when speaking earnestly, appeal to your listeners in a loving manner.

Accurate Reading








1 Timothy 4:13

SUMMARY: Read aloud exactly what is on the page.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Prepare well. Determine why the passage was written. Practice reading word groupings, not just individual words. Beware of inserting, skipping over, or substituting words. Observe all punctuation marks.





Ask a friend to monitor your reading and to point out any words that you read inaccurately.



  Pronounce each word correctly. If you do not know how to pronounce a word, look it up in a dictionary, listen to an audio recording of the publication, or ask a good reader for help.

  Speak clearly. Enunciate carefully, holding your head high and opening your mouth wide. Make an effort to pronounce each syllable.





Do not enunciate so precisely that your reading becomes unnatural.

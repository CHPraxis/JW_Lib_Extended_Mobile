Scriptures Properly Introduced








Matthew 22:41-45

SUMMARY: Prepare the minds of your listeners before you read a scripture.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Determine why you are reading the scripture. Introduce each scripture in a way that draws your listeners’ attention to the key point you are making with the verse.





Take the context into account. Attribute quotations to the correct speaker and Bible books to the correct writer.



  Cite the Bible as an authority. When you are speaking to people who believe in God, draw attention to the Bible as God’s Word, thus crediting it as the highest source of wisdom.

  Arouse interest in the scripture. Ask a question that the scripture will answer, pose a problem that the scripture will help solve, or state a principle that the Scriptural account will illustrate.





Take into account what your listeners already know about the subject and the scripture. Introduce even a familiar text in an appealing way, and help your listeners to take a fresh look at it.

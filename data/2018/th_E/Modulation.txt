Modulation








Proverbs 8:4, 7

SUMMARY: Convey ideas clearly and stir emotion by varying your volume, pitch, and pace.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Vary your volume. Increase your volume to highlight main points and to motivate your listeners. Do the same when reading Scriptural judgments. Decrease your volume to build anticipation or to convey fear or anxiety.





Do not increase your volume so often that your listeners feel scolded. Avoid drawing attention to yourself by being overly dramatic.



  Vary your pitch. If appropriate in your language, raise your pitch to express enthusiasm or to indicate size or distance. Lower your pitch to express sorrow or anxiety.

  Vary your pace. Speak more rapidly to convey excitement. Speak more slowly when stating important points.





To avoid startling your listeners, do not change pace abruptly. Do not speak so rapidly that your diction suffers.

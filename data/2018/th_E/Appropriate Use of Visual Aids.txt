Appropriate Use of Visual Aids








Genesis 15:5

SUMMARY: Use visual aids to make important points of instruction more vivid.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Select visual aids that enhance your teaching. Use pictures, diagrams, maps, time lines, or other visual aids to highlight important points, not minor details. Help your listeners to remember not just the visual aid but the point of instruction.

  Make sure that your listeners can see the visual aid.





Well before your presentation, ensure that any visual aids you plan to use are ready.







IN THE MINISTRY
Direct a listener’s attention to artwork in a publication, and ask him to comment on what he sees. Ask additional questions, as needed, to emphasize key ideas. When playing a video, turn the screen to face your listener. Generally, it is not necessary to talk while the video is playing.

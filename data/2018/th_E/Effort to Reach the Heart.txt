Effort to Reach the Heart








Proverbs 3:1

SUMMARY: Help your listeners to appreciate what they learn and to act on it.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Help your listeners to make a self-examination. Ask rhetorical questions to help people in your audience examine their own feelings.

  Appeal to good motives. Urge your listeners to analyze why they perform good works. Help them to build the finest motives​—love for Jehovah, for fellow humans, and for Bible teachings. Reason with your listeners; do not lecture them. Rather than shaming them, leave them encouraged at the end of your presentation, motivated to do their best.

  Direct attention to Jehovah. Highlight how Bible teachings, principles, and commands reflect God’s qualities and his love for us. Cultivate in your listeners a desire to consider Jehovah’s feelings and to please him.





Remember that Jehovah draws people. Use his Word to motivate your listeners.







IN THE MINISTRY
When possible, use questions to find out what your listener really believes. Observe his facial expression and tone of voice for signs of his true feelings. However, be patient. You will likely have to build trust before your listener will reveal his inmost feelings.

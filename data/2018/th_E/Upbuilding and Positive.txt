Upbuilding and Positive








Job 16:5

SUMMARY: Focus on things that improve a situation and that inspire confidence.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Cultivate a positive view of your listeners. Assume that your fellow believers want to please Jehovah. Even if you must give counsel, first sincerely commend whenever possible.





Let love, not irritation, motivate what you say. Smile warmly to build a rapport with your listeners.



  Limit negative material. Include negative aspects of a topic only to the extent that they serve a useful purpose. The overall tone of your presentation should be positive.

  Make good use of God’s Word. Draw attention to what Jehovah has done, is doing, and will do for humankind. Impart hope and courage to your listeners.





IN THE MINISTRY
Consider each person as a potential fellow believer.

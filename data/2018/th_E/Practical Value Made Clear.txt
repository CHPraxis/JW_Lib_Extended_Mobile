Practical Value Made Clear








Proverbs 3:21

SUMMARY: Help your listeners to understand how your subject affects their lives, and show them what to do with what they learn.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Think about your listeners. Meditate on why your listeners need to hear the information you are sharing, and consider what aspect of the topic will be particularly helpful to them.

  Throughout your presentation, show your listeners what to do. Right from the start, each listener should realize, ‘This involves me.’ As you develop each main point, show how to apply it. Avoid speaking in generalities.





Discuss the application of Bible principles lovingly and empathetically. Rather than burdening others with guilt, strengthen their love and faith, confident that their heart will motivate them to do the right thing.







IN THE MINISTRY
When preparing to preach, give thought to what is in the news and to topics that may interest people in your territory. Adapt your comments to address what is most practical then and there. Ask tactful questions that draw out a person’s concerns and interests. Then listen to the response, and adapt your teaching accordingly.

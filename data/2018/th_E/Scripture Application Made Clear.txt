Scripture Application Made Clear








John 10:33-36

SUMMARY: Do not simply read a scripture and then move on to the next point. Make sure that your listeners see clearly the connection between the scripture you read and the point you are making.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Isolate key words. After reading a scripture, highlight the words that relate directly to your main point. You may do this by repeating those words or by asking a question that invites your listeners to identify the key words.





If you use different words to restate the idea of the scripture, be sure that your listeners can still plainly see how the words in the Bible itself connect to your main point.



  Emphasize the point. If you introduced the scripture with a clear reason for reading it, explain how the key words of the scripture relate to that reason.





As you discuss the scripture, keep your Bible open. This helps your listeners to connect your words to the verse you just read.



  Make your application simple. Avoid commenting on irrelevant details that do not contribute to the main point. Based on what your listeners already know about the topic, decide how many facts are necessary to make the point of application clear and understandable.

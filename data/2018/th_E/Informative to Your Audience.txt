Informative to Your Audience








1 Corinthians 9:19-23

SUMMARY: Stimulate the thinking of your listeners, leaving them with the feeling that they learned something worthwhile.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Consider what your listeners already know. Rather than simply repeating what they have heard before, help them to look at the topic from a fresh perspective.





Cover familiar points more quickly, but slow down when presenting new ideas.



  Research and meditate. When possible, include less-familiar facts or current events to illustrate key ideas. Think deeply about your material and the connection between the material and the facts you intend to cite.





As you examine the material, stimulate your own thinking by asking yourself such questions as ‘what, why, when, where, who, and how.’ Enliven your teaching by raising and answering some of those questions throughout your presentation.



  Show the usefulness of your message. Explain how Scriptural points can help your listeners in their daily lives. Discuss specific situations, attitudes, and actions that are relevant to your listeners.

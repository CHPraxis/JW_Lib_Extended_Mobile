Effective Conclusion








Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14

SUMMARY: In your final remarks, appeal to your listeners to accept and apply what they have learned.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Connect your conclusion to your overall topic. Restate or rephrase your main points and theme.

  Motivate your listeners. Show your listeners what to do, and give sound reasons for doing so. Speak earnestly and with conviction.

  Keep your conclusion simple and brief. Do not introduce new main points. Using as few words as are needed, make a final appeal for action.





Do not rush your conclusion, and do not let your voice simply fade away. Deliver the last few sentences with a note of finality.







IN THE MINISTRY
As you conclude the discussion, repeat the main point you want your listener to remember. If a conversation ends abruptly, conclude the conversation on a positive note. Even if a person is rude, respond in a way that may motivate him to listen next time.

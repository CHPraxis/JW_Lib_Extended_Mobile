Effective Introduction








Acts 17:22

SUMMARY: Your introduction should arouse interest, identify your subject, and show why your listeners should be interested in it.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Arouse interest. Select a question, statement, real-life experience, or news item that will be of interest to your listeners.





In advance, give careful thought to the interests and concerns of your listeners and adapt your introduction accordingly.



  Identify your subject. Make sure that your introduction makes the subject and purpose of your presentation clear to your listeners.

  Show why the subject is important. Adapt what you say to the practical needs of your listeners. They should clearly understand how the subject can help them personally.





While preparing a discourse, ask yourself, ‘What situations are brothers and sisters in my congregation facing?’ Then tailor your introduction to their needs.







IN THE MINISTRY
To determine what a person might be interested in, observe his or her activities or surroundings. Begin a conversation by asking a question or making a brief comment about those things.

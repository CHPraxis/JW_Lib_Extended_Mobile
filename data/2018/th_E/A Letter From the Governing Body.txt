A Letter From the Governing Body




“You should be teachers.” (Heb. 5:12) Imagine! Jehovah​—the finest Teacher in the universe—​invites us to teach others about him! Any assignment to teach the truth about Jehovah​—in the family, in the congregation, or in the field ministry—​is a precious privilege and a weighty responsibility. How can we succeed?
The answer is found in the words that the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy: “Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” Paul added: “By doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:13, 16) You have a lifesaving message to share. So it is vital to work at improving your reading and teaching. This brochure is designed to help you do that. Consider a few of its features.





A cited scripture on each page that is either a Bible principle related to the study point or an example of the study point being applied





Practical tips that relate to the main point being discussed


IN THE MINISTRY
Suggestions that apply specifically to the field ministry. Most of the other points in the brochure can apply both to the field ministry and to teaching from the platform.


Jehovah is the “Grand Instructor.” (Isa. 30:20) While this brochure will help you to sharpen your skills as a reader and a teacher, never forget that Jehovah is the Source of our message and that he draws people. (John 6:44) Therefore, pray often for holy spirit. Make liberal use of God’s Word. Draw attention to Jehovah, never to yourself. Endeavor to build in your listeners’ hearts a deep love for him.
You have been invited to teach the most important message ever given to humans. We are confident that as you depend “on the strength that God supplies,” you will succeed.​—1 Pet. 4:11.
Your fellow teachers,
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

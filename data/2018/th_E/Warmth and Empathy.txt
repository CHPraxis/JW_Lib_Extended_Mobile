Warmth and Empathy








1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8

SUMMARY: Speak with genuine emotion, and show your listeners you care.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Think about your listeners. Prepare your heart by reminding yourself of the problems they face. Try to imagine how they feel.

  Choose your words carefully. Seek to refresh, comfort, and invigorate your listeners. Avoid expressions that could needlessly offend them, and do not speak disparagingly of unbelievers or their sincerely held beliefs.

  Show your interest. With a kind tone of voice and appropriate gestures, show your listeners that you really care. Be mindful of your facial expressions; smile often.





Do not force or exaggerate emotions. While reading, express the feelings indicated in the passage, but do not draw undue attention to yourself. Since emphasizing consonants can result in a cold, clipped delivery, draw out vowels to warm up the tone of your voice.

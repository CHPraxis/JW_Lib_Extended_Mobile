1 Corinthians 14:9

SUMMARY: Help your listeners to grasp the meaning of your message.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Study your material thoroughly. Understand the topic clearly so that you can explain it simply and in your own words.

  Use short sentences and simple phrases. Although longer sentences are acceptable, convey key points using concise phrases and sentences.





Eliminate unnecessary details that may confuse and overwhelm your listeners. Favor plain language over complicated speech.



  Explain unfamiliar terms. Minimize the use of expressions that are unfamiliar to your listeners. If you must refer to an unfamiliar term, Bible character, or ancient measurement or custom, provide an explanation.

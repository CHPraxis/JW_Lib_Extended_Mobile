Illustrations That Teach








Matthew 13:34, 35

SUMMARY: Enhance your teaching with simple illustrations that appeal to your listeners and teach important points.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Choose simple illustrations. Like Jesus, use little things to explain big things, and easy things to explain difficult things. Do not add needless details that complicate the illustration. Make sure that the features of your illustration really apply to the lesson you are teaching so that your listeners are not distracted by mismatched elements.





Be observant. Look at the world around you, study Christian publications, and listen to skilled teachers. As you do so, take note of illustrations you can use to enhance your teaching. Save these illustrations in a file.



  Keep your listeners in mind. Select illustrations that involve activities and interests of your listeners. Be careful that your illustrations will neither embarrass nor offend them.

  Teach the main point. Focus on illustrating main points, not minor details. Ensure that your listener will remember not merely the illustration but also the point of instruction.

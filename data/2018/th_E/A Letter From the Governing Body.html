<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“You should be teachers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12</a>) Imagine! Jehovah​—the finest Teacher in the universe—​invites <em>us </em>to teach others about him! Any assignment to teach the truth about Jehovah​—in the family, in the congregation, or in the field ministry—​is a precious privilege and a weighty responsibility. How can we succeed?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The answer is found in the words that the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy: “Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” Paul added: “By doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:13-54:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16</a>) You have a lifesaving message to share. So it is vital to work at improving your reading and teaching. This brochure is designed to help you do that. Consider a few of its features.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) Therefore, pray often for holy spirit. Make liberal use of God’s Word. Draw attention to Jehovah, never to yourself. Endeavor to build in your listeners’ hearts a deep love for him.</p>

Enthusiasm








Romans 12:11

SUMMARY: Stimulate and motivate your listeners by speaking with zeal.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Get your heart involved. As you prepare to deliver your presentation, think deeply about the importance of your message. Get to know your material so well that you can express yourself from the heart.

  Think about your listeners. Meditate on how the information you will read or teach will benefit others. Consider ways to present that information in a way that will deepen your listeners’ appreciation for it.

  Breathe life into your delivery. Speak with zeal. Use natural gestures and sincere facial expressions to reflect your feelings.





Take care not to distract your listeners by using the same gesture repeatedly as a mannerism. Make your gestures meaningful. Express enthusiasm primarily when teaching main points and motivating your listeners to take action. Do not tire your listeners by projecting a high level of enthusiasm throughout your presentation.

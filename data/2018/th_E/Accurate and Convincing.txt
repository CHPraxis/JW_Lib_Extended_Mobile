Accurate and Convincing








Luke 1:3

SUMMARY: Use trustworthy evidence to help your listeners arrive at the correct conclusion.




HOW TO DO IT:

  Consult reliable sources. Base your comments on God’s Word, reading directly from it when possible. If you refer to a scientific fact, a news report, an experience, or other supporting evidence, check in advance that your source is trustworthy and up-to-date.

  Use sources properly. Apply scriptures in harmony with their context, the Bible’s overall message, and the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45) Use secular sources in accord with the original context and the intent of the writer.





Do not overstate or exaggerate facts and figures. Be careful that “some people” does not become “the majority of people,” “in some cases” does not become “always,” and “possibly” does not become “probably.”



  Reason on the evidence. After reading a scripture or citing a source, ask tactful questions or illustrate the point to help your listeners draw their own conclusion.





IN THE MINISTRY
As you prepare to preach, anticipate questions that you might be asked, and research possible responses. If your listener poses a question and you do not know the answer, offer to research the topic and return later.

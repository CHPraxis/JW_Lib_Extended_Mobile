TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LUKE 14-16
The Parable of the Lost Son




15:11-32
Some lessons that we learn from the parable.
  It is wise to remain in the security of God’s people, under the care of our loving heavenly Father

  If we deviate from God’s way, we should humbly return, confident of Jehovah’s willingness to forgive us

  We should imitate Jehovah by warmly welcoming those who repent and return to the congregation

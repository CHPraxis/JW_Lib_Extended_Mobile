TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LUKE 12-13
“You Are Worth More Than Many Sparrows”




12:6, 7





What is the context of Jesus’ words at Luke 12:6, 7? In verse 4, we read that Jesus told his followers not to be afraid of those who may oppose them or who may even kill them. Jesus was preparing his disciples for the opposition that they would later face. He assured them that Jehovah valued each of His servants and that He would not allow permanent harm to come to them.
How can we imitate Jehovah’s concern for those who are being persecuted?
Where can we find updated information on Jehovah’s Witnesses who are imprisoned for their faith?
How many brothers and sisters are imprisoned?

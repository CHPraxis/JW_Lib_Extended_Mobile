<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="se">In order to make straight furrows, a plowman could not be distracted by what was behind him. Similarly, a Christian cannot allow himself to be distracted by the things that he left behind in the world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:13-50:3:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Php 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="se">When we experience difficulties, it is easy to long for ‘the good old days,’ perhaps the days before we came into the truth. When doing so, we often exaggerate the joys and minimize the problems of the past. That is what the Israelites did after they left Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:5-4:11:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 11:5, 6</a>) If we were to dwell on such thoughts, we could be tempted to return to our former way of life. How much better it is to count our present blessings and to focus on future joys under the Kingdom!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:16-47:4:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Co 4:16-18</a>.</p>

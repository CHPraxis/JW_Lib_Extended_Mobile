TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LUKE 10-11
The Parable of the Neighborly Samaritan




10:25-37
Jesus gave this parable in answer to the question: “Who really is my neighbor?” (Lu 10:25-29) He knew that the Christian congregation would come to be made up of “all sorts of” people​—including Samaritans and Gentiles. (Joh 12:32) This parable taught his followers that they should go out of their way to show love to others, even those who may be very different from them.





ASK YOURSELF:
‘How do I feel about brothers and sisters who are from different cultures?’

‘Do I spend time mainly with those I have things in common with?’

‘Could I open my heart wide by getting better acquainted with fellow Christians who have a different background?’ (2Co 6:13)


Whom can I invite to . . .
  work with me in the ministry?

  come to my home for a meal?

  join my family for our next Family Worship evening?

In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:4-42:12:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">verse 4</a>, we read that Jesus told his followers not to be afraid of those who may oppose them or who may even kill them. Jesus was preparing his disciples for the opposition that they would later face. He assured them that Jehovah valued each of His servants and that He would not allow permanent harm to come to them.</p>

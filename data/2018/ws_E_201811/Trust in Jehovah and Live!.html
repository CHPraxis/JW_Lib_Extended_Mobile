<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>Why do we all need comfort?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">WE ALL need comfort. Perhaps our lives have become full of worries, disappointments, and anxieties. We may be suffering because we have an illness, because we are getting older, or because someone we love has died. Some of us are being treated badly by others. Additionally, people around us are becoming more and more violent. True, these “critical times” prove that we are living “in the last days” and that each day we are getting closer to the new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Still, maybe we have waited a long time for Jehovah’s promises to come true, and we may be experiencing more and more difficulties. So where can we find comfort?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>2, 3. </strong>(a) What do we know about Habakkuk? (b) Why will we examine the book of Habakkuk?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Let us examine the book of Habakkuk to find the <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>answer to that question. Even though the Scriptures do not give us many details about Habakkuk’s life, his book is truly encouraging. The name Habakkuk probably means “Ardent Embrace.” This could refer to Jehovah’s warm embrace that comforts his worshippers. Or it could also refer to the way that his worshippers tightly hold on to Jehovah. Habakkuk spoke to God and asked him some questions. Jehovah inspired Habakkuk to write down the conversation because He knew that we would benefit from it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:2-35:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>This conversation between the distressed prophet and Jehovah is all that the Bible tells us about Habakkuk. But his book is part of “all the things that were written beforehand” in God’s Word, “so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) How can the book of Habakkuk help each one of us? It can help us to see what it means to trust in Jehovah. And Habakkuk’s prophecy assures us that we can have peace of mind no matter what problems or trials we have.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:2-35:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Habakkuk 1:2, 3</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Habakkuk lived in a very difficult time. The people around him were wicked and violent, and this made him extremely sad. Everywhere he looked, he saw the Israelites treating one another cruelly and unfairly. Habakkuk wondered: ‘When is this wickedness going to end? Why is Jehovah taking so long to do something about it?’ He felt helpless. So he begged Jehovah to do something. Habakkuk may have started to think that Jehovah no longer cared about His people or that He would not act. Have you ever felt the same way?</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What can we learn from the book of Habakkuk? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Did Habakkuk ask these questions because he had stopped trusting in Jehovah and his promises? Not at all! Habakkuk was asking Jehovah for help with his doubts and problems, which shows that he had not given up hope but still trusted in Him. Habakkuk was clearly worried and confused. He did not understand why Jehovah was waiting to act and why He was allowing him to suffer so much. The fact that Jehovah inspired Habakkuk to write down his concerns teaches us an important lesson. We must not be afraid to tell Jehovah our concerns or doubts. Actually, he kindly invites us to pray and to tell him exactly how we feel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:15-19:50:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 50:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 62:8</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5</a> <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>encourages all of us: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.” Habakkuk applied these words in his life.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why is it important to pray?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Habakkuk trusted in Jehovah, his Friend and Father, and took the initiative to draw close to him. Habakkuk did not just worry about his situation and try to fix it on his own. Rather, he prayed about his feelings and worries. This is a good example for us. Jehovah, who is the Hearer of prayer, invites us to show that we trust in him by praying and telling him our concerns. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>) When we do this, we will see how Jehovah answers our prayers. We will feel his warm embrace when he comforts and guides us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:23-19:73:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 73:23, 24</a>) He will help us to understand how he views our situation, no matter what trials we suffer. Praying to Jehovah is truly one of the best ways that we show we trust in him.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How did Jehovah react when Habakkuk told Him about his concerns?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:5-35:1:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Habakkuk 1:5-7</strong></a><strong>. </strong>After Habakkuk told Jehovah about his worries, he may have wondered how Jehovah would react. As a loving Father, Jehovah understood how Habakkuk felt. He knew that Habakkuk was suffering and begging for help. So Jehovah did not rebuke Habakkuk but told him what He would soon do to the unfaithful Jews. In fact, Habakkuk may have been the first person whom Jehovah told that their punishment would be very soon.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why was Jehovah’s answer not what Habakkuk expected?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah explained to Habakkuk that He was ready to act. He would punish the violent and wicked people of Judah. By saying that this would happen “in your days,” Jehovah showed that this judgment would come while Habakkuk or the Israelites around him were still alive. Jehovah’s answer was not at all what Habakkuk expected. The Chaldeans, or Babylonians, were brutal. They were more violent than the Israelites, who at least knew Jehovah’s standards. So why would Jehovah use this cruel pagan nation to punish his people? This would only cause more suffering for Judah.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) How would you have felt if you were Habakkuk?</p>

But he was humble and was determined to continue trusting in Jehovah. In fact, he said that Jehovah continued to be his “Rock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:4-23:26:4" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Isaiah 26:4</a>) Habakkuk was convinced that God is loving and kind, so he was not afraid to ask Jehovah some <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>more questions, such as: Why would Jehovah allow things in Judah to get even worse and his people to suffer even more? Why would he not do something right away? Why would the Almighty “keep silent” and tolerate wickedness everywhere? After all, Jehovah is the “Holy One,” and his “eyes are too pure to look on what is evil.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>Why may we sometimes feel just like Habakkuk?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Sometimes we may feel just like Habakkuk. We listen to Jehovah. We trust in him and read and study his Word, which strengthens our hope. We also hear about his promises when we listen to what his organization teaches us. But we may still wonder, ‘When will our suffering end?’ We can learn from what Habakkuk did next.</p>

The Almighty knew exactly what Habakkuk was suffering, so He comforted the prophet and lovingly assured him that He would answer his sincere questions. Habakkuk would soon get relief from all his worries. It was as if Jehovah told Habakkuk: “Just be patient and trust in me. I will answer your prayer, even if it seems to take a long time.” Jehovah reminded Habakkuk <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>that He had already decided when He would fulfill His promises. So he encouraged Habakkuk to keep waiting. In the end, the prophet would not be disappointed.</p>

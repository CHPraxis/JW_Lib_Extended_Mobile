Teamwork means that you are pilot and copilot with the same flight plan





FOR COUPLES
2 Teamwork



WHAT IT MEANS

When there is teamwork in a marriage, a husband and wife are like a pilot and copilot with the same flight plan. Even when challenges arise, each spouse thinks in terms of “we” rather than “me.”
BIBLE PRINCIPLE: “They are no longer two, but one flesh.”​—Matthew 19:6.
“Marriage is not a solo act. Husband and wife must work together to make it successful.”​—Christopher.




WHY IT MATTERS

When a conflict arises, a husband and wife who are not a team will tend to attack each other rather than the problem. Minor issues will turn into major obstacles.
“Teamwork is the essence of marriage. If my husband and I weren’t a team, we would be roommates instead of marriage mates​—two people who live together but who aren’t on the same page when it comes to important decisions.”​—Alexandra.




WHAT YOU CAN DO

TEST YOURSELF
  Do I view the money I earn as “all mine”?

  To relax fully, do I need to be away from my spouse?

  Do I keep my distance from my spouse’s relatives, even though he or she is close to them?


DISCUSS WITH YOUR SPOUSE
  In what aspect(s) of our marriage do we work well as a team?

  In what aspect(s) could we improve?

  What steps can we take to improve our spirit of teamwork?


TIPS
  Imagine a tennis match with the two of you on opposite sides of the net. Instead, what practical steps can you take to join your spouse so that you are both on the same team?

  Instead of thinking, ‘How can I win?’ think ‘How can we both win?’


“Forget about who is right and who is wrong. That isn’t as important as having peace and unity in your marriage.”​—Ethan.

BIBLE PRINCIPLE: “Look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—Philippians 2:3, 4.

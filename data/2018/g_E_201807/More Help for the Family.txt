More Help for the Family




THE BIBLE PROVIDES THE MOST RELIABLE GUIDANCE available for couples, parents, and young people. Its principles can improve a person’s thinking ability and good judgment.​—Proverbs 1:1-4.
THE BIBLE ALSO ANSWERS LIFE’S BIG QUESTIONS, SUCH AS:
  What is the meaning of life?

  Is God to blame for our suffering?

  What happens when we die?


We invite you to investigate the Bible for yourself to find the answers to these questions and more. Watch the video Why Study the Bible? Visit www.jw.org.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A goal is more than just a dream​—something you wish would happen. Real goals involve planning, flexibility, and good, old-fashioned hard work.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Goals can be short-range (taking days or weeks to accomplish), medium-range (months), and long-range (a year or more). Long-range goals can be reached through a series of intermediate goals.</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Reaching goals can boost your confidence, strengthen your friendships, and increase your happiness.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Self-confidence: </strong>When you set small goals and reach them, you gain the confidence to take on bigger ones. You also feel more confident when facing day-to-day challenges​—such as standing up to peer pressure.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Friendships: </strong>People enjoy being around those who are reasonably goal-oriented​—that is, those who know what they want and are willing to work for it. Moreover, one of the best ways to strengthen a friendship is to work with another person toward a common goal.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Happiness: </strong>When you set and reach goals, you feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“I love having goals. They keep me occupied and give me something to keep reaching for. And when you reach a goal, it feels great to look back and say, ‘Wow, I really did it! I accomplished what I set out to do.’”​—Christopher.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Take these steps to set and reach your goals.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Identify. </strong>Make a list of potential goals, and prioritize them​—choosing the ones you want to work on first, second, third, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Plan. </strong>For each goal, do the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su">  Set a realistic deadline.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="su">  Plan the steps involved.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="su">  Anticipate obstacles, and think of how to overcome them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Act. </strong>Do not wait until you have every detail worked out to get started. Ask yourself, ‘What is the very first thing I can do toward reaching my goal?’ Then do it. Track your progress as you complete each step.</p>

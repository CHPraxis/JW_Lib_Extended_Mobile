<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Develop a sense of who you are <em>now </em>and who you want to <em>become </em>by analyzing your strengths, your weaknesses, and your convictions. A good way to start is to answer the following questions.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Strengths: </strong>What talents and skills do I have? What are my strong points? (For example: Am I punctual? self-controlled? hardworking? generous?) What positive things do I do?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>TIP: </strong>Are you having trouble identifying positive things about yourself? Ask a parent or a trusted friend what strengths he or she sees in you and why.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: “Let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Galatians 6:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>What aspects of my personality need the most work? When am I especially susceptible to temptation? In what areas could I exercise greater self-control?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: “If we make the statement, ‘We have no sin,’ we are misleading ourselves.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 1:8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Convictions: </strong>What moral code do I follow, and why? Do I believe in God? What evidence has convinced me of his existence? What actions do I consider to be unjust, and why? What convictions do I hold about the future?</p>

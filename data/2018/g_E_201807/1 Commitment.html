<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Husbands and wives who are committed to their marriage view it as a permanent bond, and that creates a sense of security between them. Each spouse is confident that the other will honor the union, even in difficult times.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some couples feel compelled to stay together because of social or family pressure. Far better, however, is a sense of commitment that is based on mutual love and respect.</p>

<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“If you are committed to your marriage, you allow yourself to be wronged. You are quick to forgive and quick to apologize. You view problems as obstacles, not as deal breakers.”​—Micah.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When confronted with problems, spouses without commitment are more likely to conclude, ‘We just weren’t made for each other’ and look for ways to get out of the marriage.</p>
<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“Many people go into marriage knowing that they have a ‘fallback plan’​—divorce. When people enter marriage already thinking about the possibility of divorce, their commitment is lacking right from the start.”​—Jean.</p>

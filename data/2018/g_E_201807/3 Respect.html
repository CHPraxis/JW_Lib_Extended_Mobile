<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Respectful spouses care about each other, even during a disagreement. “These couples don’t get gridlocked in their separate positions,” says the book <em>Ten Lessons to Transform Your Marriage. </em>“Instead, they keep talking with each other about conflicts. They listen respectfully to their spouses’ perspectives and they find compromises that work for both sides.”</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Track your conversation and actions for a week. Then ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  ‘How often did I criticize my spouse, and how often did I give her a compliment?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">  ‘In what specific ways did I show respect for my spouse?’</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>TIPS</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="su">  Write down three ways you would like to be shown respect. Have your spouse do the same. Exchange lists, and work on showing respect in the areas that were identified.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su">  Make a list of traits that you admire about your spouse. Then tell your spouse how much you appreciate those traits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“To respect my husband means I show by my actions that I value him and that I want him to be happy. It isn’t always a grand gesture; sometimes a series of small acts can demonstrate genuine respect.”​—Megan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In the end, it is not a matter of whether you view yourself as respectful or not; it is a question of whether your spouse feels respected.</p>

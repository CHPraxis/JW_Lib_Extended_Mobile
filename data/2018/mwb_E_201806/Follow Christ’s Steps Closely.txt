LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Follow Christ’s Steps Closely




Jesus set an example for us to imitate, especially when we face trials or persecution. (1Pe 2:21-23) Although Jesus was insulted, he never retaliated, even when undergoing suffering. (Mr 15:29-32) What helped him to endure? He resolved to do Jehovah’s will. (Joh 6:38) He also focused on “the joy that was set before him.”​—Heb 12:2.
How do we react when we are mistreated because of our faith? True Christians do not “return evil for evil.” (Ro 12:14, 17) When we imitate the way Christ endured suffering, we can rejoice because we have God’s approval.​—Mt 5:10-12; 1Pe 4:12-14.

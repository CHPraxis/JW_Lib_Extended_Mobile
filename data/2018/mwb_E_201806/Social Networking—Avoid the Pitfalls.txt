Social Networking​—Avoid the Pitfalls









WHY IMPORTANT: Like most tools, social networks can be helpful or harmful. Some Christians choose not to use social networks. Other Christians use social networks to keep in touch with family and friends. However, the Devil wants us to use social networks unwisely, which could damage our reputation and our spirituality. Like Jesus, we can use principles from God’s Word to identify dangers and avoid them.​—Lu 4:4, 8, 12.
PITFALLS TO AVOID:
  Using social media excessively. Spending countless hours using social networks or social media can deprive us of precious time needed for spiritual pursuits
Bible principles: Eph 5:15, 16; Php 1:10

  Viewing questionable material. Looking at provocative images can lead to pornography addiction or immorality. Reading apostate material or blogs can damage one’s faith
Bible principles: Mt 5:28; Php 4:8

  Posting improper comments or photos. Because the heart is treacherous, a person may be inclined to post improper comments or photos on a social network. However, this could damage someone’s reputation or cause him to stumble spiritually
Bible principles: Ro 14:13; Eph 4:29

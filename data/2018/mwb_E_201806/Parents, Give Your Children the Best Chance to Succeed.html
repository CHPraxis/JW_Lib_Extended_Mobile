<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God-fearing parents long to see their children become faithful servants of Jehovah. Parents can help them to do so by impressing Bible teachings on the hearts of their children from infancy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 6:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Pr 22:6</a>) Does this require self-sacrifice? Most certainly! But the rewards are worth the effort.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">3Jo 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Parents can learn much from Joseph and Mary. They “were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover,” even though this required effort and expense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:41-42:2:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 2:41</a>) Apparently, they gave priority to their family’s spiritual needs. Similarly, parents today can point their children in the right direction by taking every opportunity to teach them by word and example.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 127:3-5</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">EVERYTHING belongs to Jehovah!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 100:3</a>) Yet, throughout human history, God has designated specific groups of people as belonging to him in a special way.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Who have been identified in the Bible as belonging to Jehovah in a special way?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>For example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:1-19:135:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 135</a> refers to faithful worshippers of Jehovah in ancient Israel as “his special property.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:4-19:135:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 135:4</a>) Also, the book of Hosea foretold that some non-Israelites would become Jehovah’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:23-28:2:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hos. 2:23</a>) Hosea’s prophecy was fulfilled when Jehovah included non-Jews in his selection of prospective corulers with Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:45-44:10:45" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 10:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:23-45:9:26" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 9:23-26</a>) This “holy nation” is Jehovah’s “special possession” in an outstanding way, its members having been anointed with holy spirit and chosen for life in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9, 10</a>) What about the majority of faithful Christians today who have an earthly hope?

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What is one way we can thank Jehovah for making it possible for us to have a relationship with him, and how did Jesus do something similar?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We show appreciation to Jehovah by wholeheartedly dedicating ourselves to him. By water baptism, we formally and publicly acknowledge Jehovah’s ownership of us and our willingness to subject ourselves to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:9-58:12:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 12:9</a>) Jesus did something similar when at his baptism he, in effect, said to Jehovah: “To do your will, O my God, is my desire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:7-19:40:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 40:7, 8</a>, ftn.) Jesus presented himself to do Jehovah’s will, even though since birth he had been part of a nation dedicated to God.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>(a) How did Jehovah respond when Jesus was baptized? (b) Illustrate why Jehovah appreciates our dedication, even though everything belongs to him.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah respond to Jesus’ baptism? The Bible account says: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 3:16, 17</a>) Although Jesus already belonged to his heavenly Father, Jehovah was delighted to see his Son’s willingness to do His will exclusively. Jehovah is likewise pleased to accept our dedication, and he will honor us with his blessing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:4-19:149:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 149:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>To illustrate, imagine that a man has planted many beautiful flowers in his garden. One day his little girl picks one of those flowers and offers it to him as a gift. Did not the flower already belong to the man? How could she give him something that he already owned? A loving father would not even think of such questions. Rather, he would be delighted to accept the gift as a token of his daughter’s love for him. He would surely treasure that single flower from his daughter above all the other flowers in his garden. Jehovah is no less delighted when we willingly devote ourselves to him exclusively.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 34:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How did Malachi highlight Jehovah’s feelings toward those who willingly serve him?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Malachi 3:16</strong></a><strong>. </strong>If you are not yet dedicated and baptized, consider the significance of taking such a step. Granted, from the moment you came into existence, you belonged to Jehovah, along with the rest of mankind. Yet, think how greatly it would please Jehovah if in recognition of his sovereignty, you were to dedicate yourself to him and do his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:15-20:23:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 23:15</a>) Jehovah, in turn, recognizes those who willingly serve him, and he writes their names in his “book of remembrance.”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>What does Jehovah require from those whose names are inscribed in his “book of remembrance”?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Having our name inscribed in <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>Jehovah’s “book of remembrance” as his people comes with certain obligations. Malachi specifically stated that we must ‘fear Jehovah and meditate on his name.’ Giving our worshipful devotion to anyone or anything else would result in our name being removed from Jehovah’s figurative book of life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:33-2:32:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex. 32:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:28-19:69:28" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ps. 69:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Hence, our dedication to Jehovah involves much more than a solemn promise to do his will and to submit to water baptism. These actions are brief, and they quickly become part of the past. Our stand on Jehovah’s side as his people requires an ongoing demonstration of our obedience to him both in the present and in the future​—for as long as we live.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:1-60:4:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:1, 2</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:9-45:12:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 12:9</a>) Appropriately, after Malachi mentioned the “book of remembrance,” Jehovah spoke of “the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person, between one serving God and one not serving him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:18-39:3:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mal. 3:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Sad to say, some individuals have blurred ‘the distinction between their serving God and their not serving him’ by imitating “the spirit of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:12</a>) That is a spirit that caters to ‘the desires of one’s flesh.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:3-49:2:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Eph. 2:3</a>) For example, despite all the counsel that has been given on the subject, some still prefer styles of dress and grooming that are immodest. They wear tight-fitting and revealing clothing, even to Christian gatherings. Or they have adopted extreme haircuts and hairdos. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>) As a result, when they are in a crowd, it may be difficult to tell who belongs to Jehovah and who is “a friend of the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In other ways, some Witnesses have not firmly rejected worldly conduct. Their dancing and actions at parties go beyond what is acceptable for Christians. They post on social media photos of themselves and comments that are unbecoming to spiritual people.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>To illustrate how we should treat one another in the congregation, consider the following. The utensils in Jehovah’s temple were dedicated, or set aside, exclusively for pure worship. The Mosaic Law outlined in detail how to care for these utensils, and violators were subject to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:50-4:1:51" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Num. 1:50, 51</a>) If Jehovah so jealously protected lifeless implements used in his worship, how much more would he protect his dedicated loyal worshippers whom he has chosen as his people!

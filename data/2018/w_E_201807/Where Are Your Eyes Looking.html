<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">WE ARE living in “critical times” that are “hard to deal with,” and life is going to become even more difficult before a new day dawns and true peace is restored to this earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) So we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Where am I looking for help and direction?’ Our immediate answer may be, “To Jehovah,” and that is the best response.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>What is involved in looking to Jehovah? And how can we make sure that our eyes remain fixed on him as we face life’s complex challenges? Centuries ago, a psalmist acknowledged the need for us to raise our eyes to Jehovah for help in times of need. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:123:1-19:123:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 123:1-4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He compared our looking to Jehovah with the way a servant looks to his master. What did the psalmist mean by that? Well, not only does a servant look to his master for food and protection but the servant needs constantly to watch his master to discern his wishes and then to carry them out. In a similar way, we daily need to search God’s Word to ascertain what Jehovah’s will is for us personally and then to follow that direction. Only then can we be <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>sure that Jehovah will show us favor in our time of need.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:17-49:5:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 5:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What can distract us from keeping our eyes fixed on Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Although we know the importance of continually looking to Jehovah, we may at times become distracted. That is exactly what happened to Jesus’ close friend Martha. She became “distracted with attending to many duties.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:40-42:10:42" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 10:40-42</a>) If that could happen to such a faithful person when Jesus was physically with her, we should not be surprised if the same thing could happen to us. What, then, can distract us from keeping our eyes fixed on Jehovah? In this article, we will examine how the actions of others could distract us. We will also learn how to remain focused on Jehovah.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why might we be surprised that Moses lost the privilege of entering the Promised Land?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Moses certainly looked to Jehovah for direction and guidance. Indeed, “he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:24-58:11:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 11:24-27</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Bible record tells us that “there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face-to-face.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:10-5:34:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 34:10</a>) But even though Moses had such a close relationship with Jehovah, he still lost the privilege of entering the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:12-4:20:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Num. 20:12</a>) What caused Moses to stumble?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>5-7. </strong>What problem arose shortly after the Israelites left Egypt, and how did Moses handle the situation?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Less than two months after the Israelites left Egypt, a serious problem arose​—even before they arrived at Mount Sinai. The people started to complain about a lack of water. They began to murmur against Moses, and the situation became so serious that Moses cried out to Jehovah: “What should I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:4-2:17:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 17:4</a>) Jehovah responded by giving Moses clear instructions. He was to take his rod and strike the rock in Horeb, and then water would come gushing out. We read: “Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.” The Israelites drank their fill, and the problem was solved.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:5-2:17:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The inspired record goes on to tell us that Moses “named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put Jehovah to the test by saying: ‘Is Jehovah in our midst or not?’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:7-2:17:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 17:7</a>) Those names were appropriate because they mean “Testing” and “Quarreling.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah feel about what happened there at Meribah? He viewed the actions of the Israelites as a challenge to his Godship, not just a rebellion against Moses. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:8-19:95:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 95:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Israelites were clearly in the wrong. On that occasion, Moses reacted correctly by looking to Jehovah and then carefully following his direction.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What problem arose toward the end of the 40-year journey through the wilderness?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>What happened, though, when a similar event occurred some 40 years later, toward the end of the journey through the wilderness? The Israelites again found themselves in a location that came to be called Meribah. But this was a different site, one near Kadesh, close to the border of the Promised <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Land.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The Israelites once again complained about the lack of water. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:1-4:20:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Num. 20:1-5</a>) But on this occasion, things turned out differently for Moses.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What instructions did Moses receive, but what did he do? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>How did Moses react to this rebellion? Once again he turned his eyes to Jehovah for direction. But this time Jehovah did not tell him to <em>strike </em>the rock. Moses was told to take his rod, gather the people before the crag, and then <em>speak </em>to the crag. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:6-4:20:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Num. 20:6-8</a>) Moses did not, however, speak to that rock, or crag. Rather, he vented his frustration by shouting out to those gathered there: “Hear, now, you rebels! Must we bring out water for you from this crag?” He then struck the crag not just once but twice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:10-4:20:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Num. 20:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How did Jehovah react to Moses’ actions?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah became angry, even furious, with Moses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:37-5:1:37" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 1:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:26-5:3:26" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:26</a>) Why did Jehovah react in that way? A number of factors may have been involved. As mentioned above, Jehovah may have been indignant because Moses failed to follow the new directions he had received.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How might Moses’ action of striking the rock have detracted from the miracle Jehovah performed?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>There is another possibility. Rock formations around the location of the first Meribah are solid granite. Regardless of how hard someone strikes granite, no one expects water to flow from it. However, cliff formations around the second Meribah are very different, usually consisting of softer limestone. Because of the porous nature of limestone, such areas often have underground reservoirs of water that can be tapped as a water supply. Could it be that when Moses struck such porous rock twice, he opened himself up to the accusation that the resulting flow of water was due to natural causes rather than to Jehovah? By striking the rock instead of speaking to it, was Moses, as it were, taking some of the miracle out of the miracle?<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> We cannot be certain.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>For what other reason might Jehovah have been angry with Moses and Aaron?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>There is another plausible explanation for Jehovah’s anger with Moses as well as Aaron. Notice what Moses said to the people: “Must <em>we </em>bring out water for you from this crag?” By using the word “we,” Moses was likely referring to himself and Aaron. Those words indicated a gross lack of respect for Jehovah as the true Source of that miracle. This possibility seems to be confirmed by what we read at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:32-19:106:33" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 106:32, 33</a>: “They provoked Him at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses because of them. They embittered his spirit, and he <em>spoke rashly with his lips.”</em><span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:14-4:27:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Num. 27:14</a>) <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Whatever the case, Moses’ actions detracted from the honor due Jehovah. Speaking to Moses and Aaron, Jehovah said: “You both rebelled against my order.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:24-4:20:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 20:24</a>) A serious sin indeed!</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>Why was the judgment Jehovah made concerning Moses both appropriate and consistent?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As leaders among Jehovah’s people, Moses and Aaron had a greater measure of accountability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:48-42:12:48" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 12:48</a>) Previously, Jehovah had denied a whole generation of Israelites entrance into the land of Canaan because of their rebelliousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:26-4:14:30" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Num. 14:26-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:34-4:14:34" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 34</a>) So it was both appropriate and consistent for Jehovah to make the same judgment with regard to Moses because of his rebellious act. Just like the other rebels, he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>What led Moses to adopt such a rebellious attitude? Notice <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:32-19:106:33" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 106:32, 33</a> once again: “They provoked Him at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses because of them. They <em>embittered his spirit, </em>and he spoke rashly with his lips.” Although the Israelites provoked Jehovah, it was Moses who became embittered. His lack of self-control led him to speak without considering the consequences.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Moses allowed the actions of others to distract him from keeping his eyes fixed on Jehovah. Moses handled the first incident correctly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:6-2:7:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex. 7:6</a>) Yet, it is possible that after dealing for decades with the rebellious Israelites, he had become tired and frustrated. Was Moses thinking mainly of his own feelings instead of how he could glorify Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>Why should we be concerned about Moses’ actions?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>If such a faithful prophet as Moses could be distracted and stumbled, the same thing could easily happen to us.

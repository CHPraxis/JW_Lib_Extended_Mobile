<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">POWERFUL people often dominate others or even oppress them.

Even though he is the Almighty, the most powerful Person in the universe, he is very considerate of imperfect humans. He is kind and cares about our feelings and our needs. He remembers that we are imperfect and knows our limitations, so he never asks us to do more than we are able to do.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:13-19:103:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 103:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the Bible, we learn how considerate Jehovah is of his people. Let us discuss three examples: First, how Jehovah kindly helped young Samuel to deliver a judgment message to High Priest Eli. Second, how Jehovah was patient with Moses when Moses felt that he could not lead the nation of Israel out of Egypt. And third, how Jehovah was considerate of the Israelites as they left Egypt. What <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>do we learn about Jehovah from these examples, and how can we imitate him?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What unusual thing happened to young Samuel one night, and what question might we ask? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Samuel started to serve at the tabernacle when he was very young. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:3:1-9:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 3:1</a>) One night, after he went to sleep, something very unusual happened.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:3:2-9:3:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 3:2-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He heard someone calling his name. Samuel thought that it was the aged High Priest Eli. So he obediently got up and ran to Eli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli told him: “I did not call.” After the same thing happened two more times, Eli realized that it was God who was calling Samuel. So Eli told Samuel what to say the next time, and Samuel obeyed. Why did Jehovah not tell Samuel from the beginning that He was the one calling him? The Bible does not say. But it is possible that Jehovah did things that way because he cared about Samuel’s feelings.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>(a) What did Samuel do when Jehovah gave him a message to deliver to Eli? (b) What does this account teach us about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:3:11-9:3:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 3:11-18</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jehovah’s Law commanded children to respect older people, especially those who had authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:28-2:22:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 22:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:32-3:19:32" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Leviticus 19:32</a>) So it is hard to imagine that a young boy like Samuel would go to Eli in the morning and boldly tell him God’s strong judgment message. The Bible tells us that Samuel “was afraid to tell Eli of the vision.” However, God made it clear to Eli that He was calling Samuel. As a result, Eli asked Samuel not to hide anything that God had said. Samuel obeyed Eli and “told him everything.”</p>
<div class="blockTxt floatEast"><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sc">Jehovah made it easier for Samuel to remain obedient and respectful</p>
</div>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>This message was not completely unexpected. Earlier “a man of God” had given Eli a similar message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:27-9:2:36" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>) This account teaches us how considerate and wise Jehovah is.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What lessons can we learn from the way God helped young Samuel?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Are you a young person? If so, the account about young Samuel shows that Jehovah understands your problems and your feelings. Maybe you are shy and find it hard to preach to adults or to be different from people your age. You can be sure that Jehovah wants to help you. So pray to him and tell him exactly how you feel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>) Think deeply about examples in the Bible of young ones like Samuel. And talk to brothers and sisters your age or older who may have overcome <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>problems similar to yours. They may tell you about times when Jehovah helped them, perhaps in ways they did not expect.</p>

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>CONSIDERATE OF MOSES</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>How did Jehovah show that he cared very much about Moses’ feelings?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Moses was 80 years old, Jehovah gave him a very difficult assignment: to free the nation of Israel from slavery in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:10-2:3:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 3:10</a>) This assignment was probably a shock for Moses, because he had been a shepherd in Midian for 40 years. Moses said: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” Jehovah reassured Moses: “I will prove to be with you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:11-2:3:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 3:11, 12</a>) Jehovah also promised him that the elders of Israel would “certainly listen” to him. Still, Moses asked: “Suppose they do not believe me and do not listen?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:18-2:3:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Exodus 3:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:1-2:4:1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 4:1</a>) Moses was actually saying that Jehovah could be wrong! But Jehovah was patient with Moses. He even gave him the power to perform miracles. In fact, Moses was the first human mentioned in the Bible to have this power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:2-2:4:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 4:2-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:21-2:4:21" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Even after all of that, Moses had another excuse. He said that he could not speak well. So God told him: “I will be with you as you speak, and I will teach you what you should say.” Was Moses finally convinced? No, he asked God to send someone else! Then Jehovah became angry. But he still cared about Moses’ feelings, so he sent Aaron to speak for Moses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:10-2:4:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 4:10-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How did Jehovah’s patience and kindness help Moses to be a good leader?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What does this account teach us about Jehovah? Because Jehovah is <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>the Almighty, he could have used his power to frighten Moses and make him obey. Instead, Jehovah was patient and kind, and he assured his modest and humble servant that he would be with him. Did that method work? Yes, it did! Moses became a great leader of God’s people. He tried to be mild and considerate toward others, just as Jehovah was toward him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:3-4:12:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Numbers 12:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>There may have been more than three million Israelites who left Egypt in the year 1513 before Christ. In that group were children, older ones, and probably some who were sick or disabled. Such a huge group of people needed a caring and understanding Leader.

As a result, the Israelites felt safe as they left the only home they had ever known.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:52-19:78:53" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 78:52, 53</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah make his people feel safe and secure?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:18-2:13:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 13:18</a>) Because they were organized in this way, they could clearly see that their God was in control of the situation. Jehovah also gave them “a cloud by day” and “the light of a fire” at night to remind them that he was with them, guiding them and protecting them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:14-19:78:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 78:14</a>) And the nation of Israel needed <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that reassurance because of what happened next.</p>

So you, your family, and your animals all walk onto the seabed in an organized way with the rest of the people. You are amazed that the ground is not muddy and slippery.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">ALL OF us want to honor Jehovah. He deserves our honor, and he promises to honor us in return. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:30-9:2:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:9-20:3:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Proverbs 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>) He also wants us to honor other people, such as government officials.

That is in marriage.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul wrote: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>) Paul was not just making a general statement about marriage. He was telling Christians that they had to honor marriage, that is, view it as precious. Is that how you view marriage, especially your own marriage if you are married?</p>

One of those changes was that humans began to die, and that change affected marriage.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What does the Law of Moses teach us about God’s view of marriage?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The Law that God gave to Israel provided details about marriage. For example, an Israelite man was allowed to have more than one wife. This custom had existed even before God gave the Law. However, the Law protected women and children from being mistreated. For example, if an Israelite man married a slave and later took a second wife, he still had to care for the needs of his first wife as he did before. God required that he continue to protect and care for her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:9-2:21:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 21:9, 10</a>) We do not follow the Law of Moses today. But it teaches us that God viewed <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>marriage as very precious. This certainly helps us to honor marriage.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What did the Law say about divorce? Although Jehovah never intended for a husband and a wife to get divorced, the Law did allow an Israelite man to divorce his wife if “he found something indecent about her.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:1-5:24:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 24:1</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Law did not describe what could be considered “something indecent.” However, it must have been something shameful or very serious and not just a small offense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:14-5:23:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>) Sadly, by Jesus’ day, many Jews were divorcing their wives “on every sort of grounds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:3-40:19:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 19:3</a>) We certainly do not want to develop that kind of attitude.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>In the prophet Malachi’s day, it was common for a man to divorce his first wife, perhaps to marry a younger woman who did not serve Jehovah. But God made it very clear how he viewed divorce. He said: “I hate divorce.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:14-39:2:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Malachi 2:14-16</a>) God’s view of marriage had not changed since the beginning, when he said that a man “will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 2:24</a>) And Jesus supported his Father’s view of marriage when he said: “What God has yoked together, let no man put apart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:6-40:19:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What do Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:11-41:10:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mark 10:11, 12</a> mean?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Some might ask, ‘Is there ever a reason for a Christian to divorce and remarry?’ Notice what Jesus said: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:11-41:10:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 10:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:18-42:16:18" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Luke 16:18</a>) Clearly, Jesus honored marriage, and he wanted others to do so. If a man divorced his faithful wife and remarried, he would be committing adultery. The same would be true if a woman divorced her faithful husband. That is because divorce alone does not end a marriage. God still considers the couple to be “one flesh.” Jesus also said that if a man divorced his innocent wife, she would be in danger of committing adultery. How could that be? Well, back then, a divorced woman might feel that she had to remarry for financial reasons. Such a marriage would be the same as adultery.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">Twice, Jesus said that the only reason a person can divorce his or her mate and be free to remarry is <em>por·neiʹa. </em>What does that Greek word mean? It refers to sexual activity between people who are not Scripturally married to each other. It can include sexual relations, oral sex, anal sex, or manipulating another person’s genitals in a sexual way.​—See <em>The Watchtower, </em>July 15, 2006, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2006528/">Questions From Readers</a>.”</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What is the only reason a Christian could divorce and be free to remarry?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jesus taught that there is one reason that a person could get a divorce: “I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of <strong>sexual </strong><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><strong>immorality, </strong>and marries another commits adultery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 19:9</a>) He made the same point in the Sermon on the Mount. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:31-40:5:32" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 5:31, 32</a>) Both times, Jesus referred to “sexual immorality.” Sexual immorality may include sins such as adultery, prostitution, sex relations between unmarried individuals, homosexuality, and bestiality. If, for example, a married man commits sexual immorality, his wife can decide whether to divorce him or not. If she divorces him, God would no longer view them as married.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why might a Christian decide not to get a divorce even if his or her mate commits sexual immorality?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Notice that Jesus did not say that if a married person committed sexual immorality, the innocent mate <strong>had to </strong>divorce. For example, a wife might choose to stay married to her husband even though he committed sexual immorality. Why? She might still love him and might be willing to forgive him and work with him to improve their marriage. Also, if she got a divorce and did not remarry, she would have certain difficulties. For example, what about her material and sexual needs? Would she be lonely? How would a divorce affect her children? Would it be more difficult to raise them in the truth? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:14-46:7:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) Clearly, an innocent mate who chose to obtain a divorce would have serious difficulties.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>(a) What happened in Hosea’s marriage? (b) Why did Hosea take Gomer back, and what can we learn from his marriage?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The prophet Hosea’s experience teaches us much about how God views marriage. God told Hosea to marry a woman named Gomer, who would become “a woman of prostitution” and would have “children of prostitution.” Gomer and Hosea had a son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hosea 1:2, 3</a>) Later, Gomer had a daughter and another son, likely from another man. Even though Gomer committed adultery more than once, Hosea stayed married to her. Eventually, she left Hosea and became a slave. Still, Hosea bought her back. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hosea 3:1, 2</a>) Jehovah used Hosea to show how He repeatedly forgave Israel after the nation was unfaithful to Him and worshipped other gods. What can we learn from Hosea’s marriage?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>If a Christian’s mate committed immorality, the innocent Christian would have to make a decision. Jesus said that the innocent mate would have a valid reason to get a divorce and then be free to remarry. However, it would not be wrong if the innocent one chose to forgive his or her mate. Hosea took back Gomer. After she returned to Hosea, he told her that she could not have sexual relations with any other man. Hosea did “not have relations” with Gomer for a while. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:3-28:3:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hosea 3:3</a>, footnote) But eventually, Hosea must have had relations with his wife again. This represented how God was willing to accept the Israelites back and continue his relationship with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:11-28:1:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hosea 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:3-28:3:5" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 3:3-5</a>) What does this teach us about marriage today? If an innocent mate begins to have sexual relations <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>with the guilty mate again, that would show that the innocent one has forgiven him or her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:5-46:7:5" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 5</a>) Then there would no longer be a valid reason for divorce.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Paul did not explain what situations caused couples to separate. But we do know that the problem was not, for example, that the husband had committed sexual immorality. Otherwise, the wife would have had a reason to divorce and remarry. Paul wrote that a wife who separated from her husband should “remain unmarried or else be reconciled with her husband.” So God still viewed that couple as married. Paul said that whatever problems or difficulties a couple might have, if neither of them had committed sexual immorality, their goal should be to reconcile, that is, to solve their problems and stay together. They could ask the elders for help. The elders would not take sides, but they could offer practical advice from the Bible.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>However, what if a Christian is married to someone who does not serve Jehovah? When there are problems in their marriage, is separation acceptable? As already mentioned, the Bible says that sexual immorality is a valid reason for divorce. But the Bible does not state reasons why a couple may separate. Paul wrote: “If a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is agreeable to staying with her, let her not leave her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:12, 13</a>) This applies today too.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>Why have some Christians stayed married even when they have serious difficulties?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>However, there have been some cases where “an unbelieving husband” has shown that he is not “agreeable to staying” with his wife. For example, he might be extremely physically abusive, even to the point that she feels that her health or life is in danger. He might refuse to support her and the family materially or make it impossible for her to serve God. In such cases, a Christian wife may personally decide that, despite what her husband might say, he is not “agreeable to staying” with her and that it is necessary to separate. But other Christians in similar situations have decided to stay with their mate. They have endured and tried to work on improving the marriage. Why would they decide to do that?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>If a couple separated in such a situation, they would still be married and would have the difficulties we mentioned earlier. The apostle Paul also gave another reason for a couple to stay together. He wrote: “The unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:14-46:7:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>) Many Christians decided to stay with their mate who did not serve Jehovah even though the situation was very difficult.

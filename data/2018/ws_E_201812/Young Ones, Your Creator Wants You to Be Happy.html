<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">IF YOU are young, you probably get a lot of advice about your future. Teachers, guidance counselors, or others may tell you that you need to get a higher education or a career that will help you make lots of money. But Jehovah gives you different advice. Of course, he wants you to work hard at school so that you will be able to make a living and support yourself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:23</a>) But he also knows that when you are young, you need to make important decisions that will affect your future. So he provides principles to guide you and help you to live your life in a way that will please him during these last days.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Remember that Jehovah knows everything. He knows what will happen in the future, and he knows exactly how close the end of this system is. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>36</a>) Jehovah also knows <strong>you. </strong>He knows what will make you happy and what will make you unhappy.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>How did listening to bad advice affect Adam and Eve and their children?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Bad advice has been around for a long time. Satan was the first one to give humans bad advice. He told Eve that she and Adam would be happier if they decided for themselves how to live. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) But Satan was selfish! He wanted Adam and Eve, as well as their future children, to obey and worship <strong>him, </strong>not Jehovah. But Satan had not done anything for humans. It was Jehovah who had given them everything they had. He gave them each other, a beautiful garden to live in, and their perfect bodies that could last forever.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Sadly, Adam and Eve disobeyed God. By doing so, they cut themselves off from the One who gave them life. The results were tragic. Like flowers cut off from a plant, Adam and Eve slowly grew old and died. Their children suffered too, and that includes all of us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Most people today ignore what God says and do just what they want to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>) What are the results? The Bible says that “there is no wisdom” when people oppose Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:30-20:21:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:30</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah was confident that there would be people, including many young ones, who would want to know him and serve him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) We call these publications spiritual food because they nourish our faith and make our relationship with Jehovah stronger.

These qualities will also help you to avoid desires or habits that will hurt you. So do all that you can to become wise and to think clearly. Then you will see for yourself that Jehovah loves you and wants what is best for you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>Why should we value freedom and use it in a wise way?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Paul wrote: “Where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:17-47:3:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>) Jehovah loves freedom, and he created you to love freedom too. But he wants you to use your freedom in a wise way that will protect you. Maybe some of your peers look at pornography, are sexually immoral, risk their lives in extreme sports, or abuse drugs or alcohol. At first, these things may seem fun or exciting, but they often lead to bad results, such as disease, addiction, or even death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:8" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>) Young people who are involved in these things may think that they are free, but they are not.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:3-56:3:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Titus 3:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>(a) How does obedience to God make us truly free? (b) In what way were Adam and Eve more free than humans today?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>On the other hand, obedience to Jehovah is good for us. It is good for our health and makes us truly free. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>) And when you use your freedom in a wise way, that is, when you choose to obey God’s perfect laws and principles, you show both God and your parents that you are a responsible person. Your parents will probably trust you more and give you more freedom. And Jehovah promises that soon he will give all of his faithful servants perfect freedom, which the Bible calls “the glorious freedom of the children of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Romans 8:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>This is the kind of freedom that Adam and Eve enjoyed. In the garden of Eden, there was only one thing that God told them not to do. They should not eat the fruit of one particular tree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:9-1:2:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Genesis 2:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Do you think that God was being unfair or too strict by giving them that law? Of course not! Think about how many laws humans have made and forced others to obey. But Jehovah gave Adam and Eve only one law.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>19. </strong>What are Jehovah and Jesus teaching us that will help us become free?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jehovah is very wise in the way that he treats us. Instead of giving us many laws, he patiently teaches us to obey the law of love. He teaches us to live by his principles and to hate what is bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:9-45:12:9" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Romans 12:9</a>) In the Sermon on the Mount, his Son, Jesus, helped <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>us to understand why people do bad things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27, 28</a>) And in the new world, as King of God’s Kingdom, Jesus will keep teaching us to view right and wrong as he does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:9-58:1:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:9</a>) Jesus will also make us perfect in our mind and body. Imagine what it will be like when we are not even tempted to do bad things and we do not suffer because of being imperfect. Then, at last, we will enjoy “the glorious freedom” that Jehovah promises.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>20. </strong>(a) How does Jehovah use his freedom? (b) How can you imitate him?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>In the new world, our freedom will still have limits. In what way? We will always need to be motivated by our love for God and for others. When we are guided by love, we are imitating Jehovah. Even though Jehovah has complete freedom, he chooses to let love guide everything he does, including the way he treats us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:8" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 John 4:7, 8</a>) So it makes sense that we can be truly free only when we imitate God.</p>

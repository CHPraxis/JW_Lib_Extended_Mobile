<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>WHY IMPORTANT: </strong>Jehovah makes seeds of truth grow in the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:7-46:3:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Co 3:7</a>) We work along with him by focusing our efforts in the ministry on those who respond to what they learn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:26-46:9:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Co 9:26</a>) Bible students need to understand that Christian baptism is necessary to gain salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Pe 3:21</a>) We help them to become disciples by teaching them to make changes in their life, to preach and teach, and to dedicate their life to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Remind Bible students that the purpose of their study is to help them ‘come to know’ Jehovah and please him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joh 17:3</a></p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sc">If you have a Bible student who is making good progress, have you asked him if any of his friends or relatives would enjoy learning what the Bible teaches? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:40-43:1:41" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joh 1:40, 41</a>) You might encourage him to describe the study arrangement to his friends and then arrange for you to demonstrate a Bible study to one of them. By asking for referrals, we keep searching for deserving ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 10:11</a>.</p>

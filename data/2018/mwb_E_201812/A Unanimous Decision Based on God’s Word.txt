A congregation listens to the decision of the governing body





TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 15-16
A Unanimous Decision Based on God’s Word




What can we learn from the way this situation was resolved?
15:1, 2​—Exercise humility and patience. Rather than settling the issue themselves, Paul and Barnabas sought direction from Jehovah’s organization.
15:28, 29​—Trust God’s organization. The congregation was confident that Jehovah would direct matters by means of his holy spirit and Christ Jesus.
16:4, 5​—Obey. The congregations prospered when they followed the direction from the governing body.



What is one example of recent direction received from Jehovah’s organization?
How do I benefit from following it?

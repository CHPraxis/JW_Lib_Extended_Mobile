LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Helping “Rightly Disposed” Ones to Become Disciples




WHY IMPORTANT: Jehovah makes seeds of truth grow in the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Ac 13:48; 1Co 3:7) We work along with him by focusing our efforts in the ministry on those who respond to what they learn. (1Co 9:26) Bible students need to understand that Christian baptism is necessary to gain salvation. (1Pe 3:21) We help them to become disciples by teaching them to make changes in their life, to preach and teach, and to dedicate their life to Jehovah.​—Mt 28:19, 20.
HOW TO DO IT:
  Remind Bible students that the purpose of their study is to help them ‘come to know’ Jehovah and please him.​—Joh 17:3

  Help them to make spiritual progress by overcoming obstacles, such as bad habits and questionable association

  Strengthen and encourage them before and after their baptism.​—Ac 14:22

Do You Ask for Referrals?
If you have a Bible student who is making good progress, have you asked him if any of his friends or relatives would enjoy learning what the Bible teaches? (Joh 1:40, 41) You might encourage him to describe the study arrangement to his friends and then arrange for you to demonstrate a Bible study to one of them. By asking for referrals, we keep searching for deserving ones.​—Mt 10:11.

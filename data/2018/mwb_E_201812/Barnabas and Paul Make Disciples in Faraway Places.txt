Paul and Barnabas before Sergius Paulus





TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 12-14
Barnabas and Paul Make Disciples in Faraway Places




13:12, 48; 14:1, 21, 22
Despite fierce opposition, Barnabas and Paul worked hard to help meek ones to embrace Christianity
  They preached to people of all backgrounds

  They encouraged new disciples “to remain in the faith”





We can never know who is “rightly disposed for everlasting life” until we offer a witness, perhaps many times. Therefore, we preach to all without partiality.
To whom can I offer a Bible study this week?
What are some ways that I can encourage fellow Christians “to remain in the faith”?

Imitate the Apostle Paul in Preaching and Teaching

How can we imitate the apostle Paul’s example?





  We can use the Scriptures to reason with people, and we can adapt our reasoning to our audience






  We can preach where and when we are likely to find people






  We can tactfully acknowledge others’ beliefs in order to establish common ground





FOR MEDITATION: Where and when can I find more people to witness to in my congregation’s territory?

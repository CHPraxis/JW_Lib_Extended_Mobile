TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 19-20
“Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock”




20:28, 31, 35





Elders feed, protect, and care for the flock, remembering that each sheep was bought with Christ’s precious blood. Christians truly appreciate and love those who, like Paul, give of themselves unselfishly in behalf of the flock.



Ask yourself, ‘How am I showing my appreciation for the hard work of the congregation elders?’

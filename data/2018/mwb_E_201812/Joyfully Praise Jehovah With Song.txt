LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Joyfully Praise Jehovah With Song




Paul and Silas praised Jehovah with song while they were in prison. (Ac 16:25) No doubt their singing strengthened them to endure. What about us today? Songs used for worship and original songs can lift our spirit and help us to remain faithful when under trial. More than that, they praise Jehovah. (Ps 28:7) We have been encouraged to memorize the lyrics of at least some of the songs. Have you tried to do so? We can use family worship to practice the songs and learn the lyrics.

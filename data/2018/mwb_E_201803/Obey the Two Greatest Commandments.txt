TREASURES FROM GODâ€™S WORD | MATTHEW 22-23
Obey the Two Greatest Commandments




22:36-39
Using Matthew 22:36-39, number in order of importance the following reasons for attending Christian meetings:
To be encouraged

To encourage our brothers

To worship and demonstrate our love for Jehovah







Why should we try to go to our meetings even when we are tired and feel that we will receive little personal benefit from attending?
What are other ways in which we can demonstrate our obedience to the two greatest commandments?

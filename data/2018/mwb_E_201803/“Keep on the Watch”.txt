TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 25
“Keep on the Watch”




25:1-12
Although Jesus directed the parable of the ten virgins to his anointed followers, its basic message applies to all Christians. (w15 3/15 12-16) “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.” (Mt 25:13) Can you explain Jesus’ parable?
  Bridegroom (vs. 1)​—Jesus

  Discreet, prepared virgins (vs. 2)​—Anointed Christians who are prepared to carry out their assignment faithfully and who shine as illuminators until the end (Php 2:15)

  The shout: “Here is the bridegroom!” (vs. 6)​—Evidence of Jesus’ presence

  Foolish virgins (vs. 8)​—Anointed Christians who go out to meet the Bridegroom but who do not remain watchful and do not maintain their integrity

  The discreet virgins refuse to share their oil (vs. 9)​—After the final sealing, it is too late for faithful anointed ones to help any who have turned unfaithful

  “The bridegroom came” (vs. 10)​—Jesus comes to render judgment near the end of the great tribulation

  The discreet virgins enter the marriage feast with the bridegroom, and the door is shut (vs. 10)​—Jesus gathers his faithful anointed ones to heaven, but the unfaithful ones lose their heavenly reward


The parable does not teach that a large number of the anointed would prove unfaithful and need to be replaced. Rather, it serves as a warning that each anointed Christian has the full capacity to choose either a course of preparedness and vigilance or a course of folly and unfaithfulness. Jesus exhorted: “Prove yourselves ready.” (Mt 24:44) Regardless of our hope, Jesus requires all of us to prepare our heart for faithful service and to meet the same standard of watchfulness.
How am I demonstrating my watchfulness?

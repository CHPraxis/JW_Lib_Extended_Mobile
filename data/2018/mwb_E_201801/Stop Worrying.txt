LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Stop Worrying









In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: “Stop being anxious about your lives.” (Mt 6:25) While it is only natural for imperfect humans living in Satan’s world to be anxious on occasion, Jesus was teaching his followers to avoid extreme anxiety. (Ps 13:2) Why? Because undue anxiety, even about daily needs, can distract us, making it more difficult for us to seek first the Kingdom. (Mt 6:33) Jesus’ further comments will help us to stop needless worrying.
  Mt 6:26​—What can we learn from observing the birds? (w16.07 9-10 ¶11-13)

  Mt 6:27​—Why is undue worry a waste of time and energy? (w05 11/1 22 ¶5)

  Mt 6:28-30​—What lesson can we learn from the lilies of the field? (w16.07 10-11 ¶15-16)

  Mt 6:31, 32​—In what ways are Christians different from the nations? (w16.07 11 ¶17)

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 1-3
“The Kingdom of the Heavens Has Drawn Near”




3:4





  John’s dress and appearance made it immediately apparent that he lived a simple life, completely devoted to doing God’s will

  John’s unique privilege of being the forerunner of Jesus far exceeded any sacrifices he had made


A simple life helps us to do more in God’s service and results in great satisfaction. We can simplify our life by . . .
  identifying actual needs

  eliminating unnecessary expenses

  preparing a realistic budget

  disposing of things not being used

  paying off debts

  cutting back on excessive secular employment







John’s diet consisted of locusts and wild honey




What goal will a simple life allow me to pursue?

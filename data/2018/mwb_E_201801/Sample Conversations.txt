Starting this month, the midweek meeting will no longer feature three different sample presentations. Instead, the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook will have sample conversations consisting of an opening question, a scripture, and a linking question to pave the way for a return visit. Only one sample conversation video will be played per week. Each publisher can decide which publication from our Teaching Toolbox to use and when to introduce it​—whether on an initial call or a return visit. In addition, the workbook will contain ideas for two follow-up conversations. This approach will help us focus on our goal of teaching “all those who [are] rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—Ac 13:48.
Student Assignments: Unless the instructions indicate otherwise, students should demonstrate the sample conversations.

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 10-11
Jesus Offered Refreshment




11:28-30





“My yoke is kindly”
As a carpenter, Jesus knew how to shape a yoke, perhaps lining it with cloth or leather so that work could be performed as comfortably as possible. When we accept Jesus’ yoke of discipleship at the time of our baptism, we undertake challenging work and responsibilities, but doing so is a refreshing experience that results in many blessings.
What blessings have you enjoyed since you came under Jesus’ yoke?

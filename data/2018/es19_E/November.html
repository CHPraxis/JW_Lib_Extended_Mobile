We are not born with an inclination toward self-discipline. We have to learn it. When parents consistently and patiently train their little ones “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,” they are also helping their children to develop self-discipline and wisdom.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">To help determine whether we have a balanced view of secular matters and spiritual responsibilities, it is good to ask ourselves: ‘Do I find my secular work interesting and exciting but view my spiritual activities as ordinary or routine?’ Thinking about and meditating on these matters can help us to determine where our true affection lies. Jesus set the standard in balancing secular interests and spiritual matters. On one occasion, Jesus visited the home of Mary and her sister, Martha. While Martha scurried about preparing a meal, Mary chose to sit at Jesus’ feet and listen to him. When Martha complained that Mary was not helping, Jesus told Martha the words of today’s text. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:38-42:10:42" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Luke 10:38-42</a>) Jesus was teaching Martha a valuable lesson. To avoid being distracted by secular matters and to prove our love for Christ, we must continue to choose “the good portion,” to give priority to spiritual things. <a class="xt" data-xtid="363" href="jwpub://p/E:2017406/17-18"><em>w17.05 </em>24 ¶9-10</a></p>

Arranging for such help need not mean abdicating their spiritual responsibility; rather, it can be part of bringing up their children “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) For example, parents may ask elders in the congregation for suggestions on conducting family worship and for help in providing good association for their children. Also, they may invite other families to join them in family worship from time to time. Further, many young people thrive under the influence of spiritually balanced companions who may, for example, accompany them in the ministry and share with them in wholesome recreation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Prov. 27:17</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="362" href="jwpub://p/E:2017402/29-30"><em>w17.05 </em>11-12 ¶17-18</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Acts 8:1</a>) Jesus had foreseen that many of his followers would be forced from their homes. He said: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:23-40:10:23" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 10:23</a>) This has been the case for thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many have lost loved ones and nearly all their possessions. Some faced danger when fleeing or when living in a refugee camp where people drank, gambled, stole, and were immoral. Yet, they kept a positive attitude by recalling that, like Israel’s trek in the wilderness, their stay in the camp would eventually come to an end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="101-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:18</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="361" href="jwpub://p/E:2017401/9-13"><em>w17.05 </em>3-4 ¶2-5</a></p>

Instead, as faithful servants of God, we loyally and prayerfully rely on him. At the same time, we modestly acknowledge that we likely do not have all the facts. We are keenly aware that the fault may lie in our imperfect view of matters. We want to avoid negative speech, knowing that such speech only makes a bad situation worse. Finally, rather than taking matters into our own hands, let us be determined to be loyal and wait patiently on Jehovah to correct matters. Such an approach is sure to bring Jehovah’s approval and blessing. Yes, we can be certain that Jehovah, “the Judge of all the earth,” will always do what is right, “for all his ways are justice.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Gen. 18:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> Deut. 32:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="360" href="jwpub://p/E:2017362/28-28"><em>w17.04 </em>22 ¶17</a></p>

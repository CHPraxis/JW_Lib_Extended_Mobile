And that wisdom can safeguard us from moral and spiritual harm. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:10-20:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 2:10-12</a>) As a result, we “keep [ourselves] in God’s love . . . with everlasting life in view.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:21-65:1:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jude 21</a>) However, our sinful leanings, our upbringing, and other factors make it a challenge to accept discipline or to view it in the right light. We build appreciation for discipline when we experience its benefits, which confirm God’s love for us. “My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah, . . . for those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11, 12</a>.

Did that occasion not leave you with warm memories? When you entertained some from your congregation, was your friendship not deepened? By extending hospitality, we get to know our brothers and sisters in a more personal way than we can in other settings. Christians in Peter’s day needed to draw ever closer as conditions grew worse.

However, we live in a dangerous environment. Since fleshly attitudes are all around us, we need to put forth real effort to develop spirituality and to guard it once we have it.

Other songs will help “to incite [us] to love and fine works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:24" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24</a>) Surely we want to become familiar with the melodies, rhythms, and lyrics of our songs. You can do so by listening to the vocal renditions available on jw.org. By practicing the songs at home, you can learn to sing them with confidence and heartfelt expression. Remember that singing is an important feature of our worship. It is a powerful way to show our love and appreciation for Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:12:5-23:12:5" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Isa. 12:5</a>) When you sing out joyfully, you will also encourage others to sing with confidence. Indeed, all in the congregation​—young, old, and newly interested ones—​can join in this form of direct worship of Jehovah. So do not hold back in expressing yourself in song. Yes, make a joyful sound! <a class="xt" data-xtid="343" href="jwpub://p/E:2017641/28-29"><em>w17.11 </em>7 ¶18-19</a></p>

Jehovah showed love for humans even before he created Adam and Eve. He made the earth to be man’s everlasting home, a place where man does not just survive but enjoys life to the full. Jehovah did this solely for our benefit, not for personal gain. He further showed unselfish love by blessing his children on earth with the prospect of living forever in the Paradise that he had prepared for them. <a class="xt" data-xtid="341" href="jwpub://p/E:2017602/8-9"><em>w17.10 </em>7 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Family heads today recognize that they have a Scriptural responsibility to provide for their family’s material needs. They must work hard to fulfill this obligation. However, in these last days, secular work is often a source of anxiety. As a result of fierce competition for a limited number of jobs, many employees feel compelled to work more hours, sometimes for less pay. Also, the constant push for increased production takes a heavy toll on people physically, mentally, and emotionally. Employees who are unwilling to make such sacrifices for their company risk losing their jobs. As Christians, we owe our primary loyalty to Jehovah God, not to our employer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:27-42:10:27" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Luke 10:27</a>) Secular work is simply a means to an end. We work to provide our basic material needs and to support our ministry. If we are not careful, however, secular work could interfere with our worship. <a class="xt" data-xtid="330" href="jwpub://p/E:2017406/13-15"><em>w17.05 </em>23 ¶5-7</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">On occasion, new ones ask mature publishers to help them teach their children the truth. If a parent decides to have someone study with the children, the one who does so should not try to take over the role of the parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:4" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1-4</a>) There have been instances when a Witness was asked to study with children whose parents were not interested in the truth. The Witness needs to bear in mind, though, that in providing spiritual help, he or she does not become the children’s parent. And if such a study is conducted, it would be wise to do so either in the children’s home with the parents or another mature Witness around or in a suitable public area. Thus no one would have a basis to misconstrue what is occurring. It is to be hoped that the parents will, in time, fulfill their God-given responsibility to care spiritually for their children. <a class="xt" data-xtid="331" href="jwpub://p/E:2017441/25-26"><em>w17.06 </em>8 ¶15-16</a></p>

Christian parents put their children’s spiritual well-being ahead of personal preferences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="107-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24</a>) A brother named Samuel relates: “My wife and I observed our children to see in which language they thrived spiritually, and we prayed for wisdom. . . . When we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language, we decided to move to the local-language congregation. Together, we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry. We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions. All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah, not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend. We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="329" href="jwpub://p/E:2017402/21-23"><em>w17.05 </em>10 ¶11-13</a></p>

Joseph’s loyalty gave him the opportunity to see Jehovah’s hand in correcting the injustices and in blessing him and his family. In a similar way, we must cherish and guard our relationship with Jehovah. Never should we allow the imperfections of our brothers to separate us from the God we love and worship.

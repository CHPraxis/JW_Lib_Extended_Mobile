Indeed, he had to! Noah also succeeded as a family man​—and for basically the same reason; he trusted in God’s wisdom. He thus taught his children well and set a fine example for them, which was a big challenge during that wicked pre-Flood era. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:5-1:6:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 6:5</a>) As parents, how can you do “just so” in God’s eyes? Listen to Jehovah. Let him instruct you in child-rearing by means of his Word and the guidance we receive through his organization. However, despite the parents’ best efforts, some children leave Jehovah. Nonetheless, parents who have tried their best to impress the truth on a child’s heart have a good conscience. They can also hope that the wayward child will one day come “home” to Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="63" href="jwpub://p/E:2018328/19-20"><em>w18.03 </em>30 ¶10-11</a></p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The year 537 B.C.E. was one of rejoicing for Jehovah’s dedicated people. After 70 long years of captivity, they were freed from Babylon and enthusiastically got to work on restoring true worship in Jerusalem. In 536 B.C.E., the foundation of the temple was laid. Sixteen years later, the building of Jehovah’s temple was at a standstill. God’s people needed to be reminded that they should return to Jehovah and stop putting their personal pursuits first. To help his people recall why they were freed from Babylon in the first place, God sent his prophet Zechariah in 520 B.C.E. The very name Zechariah, which means “Jehovah Has Remembered,” may have brought to mind a vital truth. Though they had forgotten Jehovah’s saving acts, God still remembered his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:3-38:1:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Zech. 1:3, 4</a>) He lovingly assured them that he would help them to reestablish pure worship, but he also firmly warned them that he would not tolerate halfhearted worship. <a class="xt" data-xtid="46" href="jwpub://p/E:2017606/9-10"><em>w17.10 </em>21-22 ¶2-3</a></p>

When you relieve the suffering of others, you will feel happier, more optimistic, less lonely, and less inclined to think negative thoughts. Yes, your showing compassion will benefit you. Christians who lovingly seek to help others are rewarded with a good conscience, knowing that they are acting in harmony with godly principles. Having such a disposition makes for a more caring parent, a better spouse, and a better friend. Those who are quick to show compassion are, in turn, more likely to receive help and support when they need it.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Fleshly-minded people have difficulty cultivating a balanced view of material things. Why? Because their spiritual senses are dulled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:14-46:2:14" data-bid="91-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:14</a>) Once their powers of discernment have become clouded, it becomes more difficult for them to distinguish right from wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:11-58:5:14" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11-14</a>) As a result, some develop an uncontrolled desire for material things​—a desire that can never be fully satisfied. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:10</a>) Thankfully, there is an antidote to being poisoned by materialistic thinking: a healthy dose of God’s Word, the Bible, taken on a regular basis. Just as meditating on divine truth fortified Jesus to reject temptation, so applying Bible principles helps us to fight against materialistic desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8-10</a>) By doing so, we show Jesus that we love him more than any material thing. <a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:2017406/27-27"><em>w17.05 </em>26 ¶17</a></p>

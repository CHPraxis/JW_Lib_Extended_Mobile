<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Bringing up a child in “the discipline and admonition of Jehovah” is one of the greatest privileges a Christian parent can have. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3</a>) Unlike children in the ancient nation of Israel, the children of Christian parents are not born as part of a people dedicated to Jehovah. Moreover, love for God and for truth is not inherited. From the day of their child’s birth, parents should have the intent to make a disciple, assisting their child to become a dedicated, baptized servant of Jehovah. What could be more important? After all, it is each individual’s dedication, baptism, and faithful service to God that will bring him in line for being marked for salvation during the coming great tribulation.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">What does it mean to be a “spiritual man”? A spiritual person is inclined toward God, the opposite of the physical person.

God is very real to them. In contrast with fleshly-minded individuals, they try to bring all their ways into harmony with Jehovah’s standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:33-19:119:33" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 119:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:10-19:143:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 143:10</a>) Rather than focus on fleshly works, the spiritually-minded person endeavors to show “the fruitage of the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) To clarify the expression “spiritually-minded” further, think of this comparison: An individual who is skillful in commercial affairs is said to be business-minded.

You can learn to sing with power and volume by <em>breathing </em>properly. Much as electricity powers a light bulb, breathing energizes your voice when you speak or sing. You should sing as loud as you speak or even louder than that. In fact, within the context of singing praises, the Scriptures sometimes direct Jehovah’s worshippers to “shout joyfully.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:1-19:33:3" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 33:1-3</a>) Try the following: Choose one of your favorite songs from our songbook. Read the lyrics out loud in a strong, confident voice. Next, using the same volume, say all the words from a single phrase of the song <em>in one breath. </em>Then sing the phrase, using the same vibrant voice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:14-23:24:14" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Isa. 24:14</a>) Your singing voice will become fuller, and that is a good thing.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Jesus was keenly aware of the pressures associated with the anxieties of this system of things. In his illustration of the sower, Jesus said that some would accept “the word of the Kingdom” and make initial progress but that “the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches” would “choke the word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:19-40:13:22" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Matt. 13:19-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:19-41:4:19" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> Mark 4:19</a>) Indeed, if we are not careful, the everyday concerns of life could entice our heart and cause us to slow down spiritually. We prove the depth of our love for Christ by putting the work he has given us to do in first place. How can we make sure that we continue to do so? From time to time, we need to ask ourselves, ‘Where does my true affection lie? Does most of my joy come from engaging in mundane activities or in spiritual activities?’ <a class="xt" data-xtid="289" href="jwpub://p/E:2017406/10-11"><em>w17.05 </em>23 ¶3-4</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:9-19:146:9" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Ps. 146:9</a>) But if there is a congregation nearby that uses your mother tongue, the question arises: Which language congregation is best for your family? After careful thought and prayer and consultation with his mate and children, a family head must decide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3</a>) Parents must evaluate their children’s needs realistically. Of course​—regardless of language—​to gain a firm grasp of the truth, a child needs much more than just a few hours of spiritual education each week at meetings. But consider this: At meetings conducted in the language they understand best, children may absorb instruction simply by being present, perhaps learning more than their parents realize. That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:11-46:14:11" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="288" href="jwpub://p/E:2017402/20-21"><em>w17.05 </em>10 ¶10-11</a></p>

If I am contemplating a major move to another city or country for perceived economic advantages, do I give prayerful consideration to the effect this would have on my family and on the congregation?’ Jehovah dignifies us by allowing us to share in supporting his sovereignty. Since the Devil first enticed humans to support his rival sovereignty, your siding with Jehovah’s rulership sends Satan a message that is loud and clear. The faith and integrity that motivate your volunteer spirit are pleasing to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:15-20:23:16" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Prov. 23:15, 16</a>) He uses your display of support to make a reply to the taunts of Satan.

He should do everything he vowed he would do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:30:2-4:30:2" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Num. 30:2</a>) Later, Solomon was inspired to write the words of today’s text. Jesus confirmed the seriousness of making vows when he stated: “It was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:33-40:5:33" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 5:33</a>) It is clear, then, that it is a very serious matter to make promises to God. The way we treat our vows affects our relationship with Jehovah. David wrote: “Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah, and who may stand up in his holy place? Anyone . . . who has not sworn a false oath by My [Jehovah’s] life, nor taken an oath deceitfully.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:3-19:24:4" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps. 24:3, 4</a>; ftn. <a class="xt" data-xtid="286" href="jwpub://p/E:2017365/10-11"><em>w17.04 </em>4 ¶3-4</a></p>

Of course, it is entirely proper to seek assistance from the elders and to inform them if a member of the congregation is guilty of a serious wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:1-3:5:1" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Lev. 5:1</a>) However, in many cases that do not involve serious wrongdoing, it may be possible to resolve a difference without involving anyone else, not even the elders.

In some cases, we may come to realize that we were not the victim of an injustice after all. How grateful we would be that we did not make a situation worse by slandering a fellow Christian! Remember, whether we are right or wrong, engaging in hurtful speech will never improve a situation. Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake. <a class="xt" data-xtid="285" href="jwpub://p/E:2017362/23-23"><em>w17.04 </em>21 ¶14</a></p>

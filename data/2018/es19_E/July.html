No. Remember that the craving to control others and the longing to be admired are the desires that enticed Satan, but he is angry, not happy.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:3-5:19:3" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Deut. 19:3</a>) According to Jewish tradition, guideposts were erected to direct fugitives to the cities. Since the cities of refuge were available, an unintentional manslayer was not forced to flee to a foreign land, where he might be tempted to take up false worship. Think of it: Jehovah​—the very One who had mandated capital punishment for willful murderers—​gave unintentional manslayers ample opportunity to receive compassion and protection! “Every thing was made as plain, as simple, and as easy as possible,” wrote one commentator. Jehovah is not a heartless judge who is eager to punish his servants. Rather, he is “rich in mercy.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Eph. 2:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="232" href="jwpub://p/E:2017643/12-13"><em>w17.11 </em>14 ¶4-5</a></p>

For example, consider a 14th-century theologian named John Wycliffe. He strongly believed that everyone should be able to benefit from God’s Word. But in his time, the common people in England had virtually no access to the Bible. In 1382, the English translation later known as the Wycliffe Bible was produced. Desiring to get God’s Word into the mind and heart of ordinary people, itinerant preachers, known as the Lollards, traveled on foot from village to village throughout England. Often the Lollards read portions of the Wycliffe Bible to those whom they met, and they left handwritten copies behind. In the centuries that followed, many in Europe and other parts of the world began to promote translation and distribution of the Bible for the benefit of the common people. <a class="xt" data-xtid="227" href="jwpub://p/E:2017566/20-22"><em>w17.09 </em>20-21 ¶10-12</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation. However, our faith may be put to the test if we observe or experience what seems to be an injustice inside the congregation. How will you react if you believe that you have experienced some wrong in the congregation or in your dealings with a fellow Christian? Will you allow that to be a cause for stumbling? Because all of us are imperfect and subject to sin, we realize that there is a possibility that we could either experience injustice ourselves or be the cause of it for someone else in the congregation. Although such instances are rare, faithful Christians are not surprised or stumbled when injustices do occur. For good reason, Jehovah has provided practical advice in his Word to assist us to maintain our integrity, even if we experience wrongs at the hands of fellow believers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:12-19:55:14" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Ps. 55:12-14</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="208" href="jwpub://p/E:2017362/12-13"><em>w17.04 </em>19 ¶4-5</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">If you have an unbelieving mate, you may experience more than the usual stress and anxiety in your marriage. Nevertheless, your mate’s present unwillingness to follow Christ is not in itself a valid reason for separation or divorce. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:16" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:12-16</a>) Although an unbelieving husband may not take the lead in spiritual matters, he should be respected because of his position as the head of the family. Likewise, an unbelieving wife should be shown self-sacrificing love and tender affection by her Christian husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:23" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22, 23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) What if your spouse tries to limit your worship? For example, one sister was told by her husband to share in the field ministry only on certain days of the week. If you face a similar situation, ask yourself: ‘Is my spouse demanding that I stop worshipping my God? If not, can I yield to the request?’ Being reasonable can help you to avoid needless marital conflict.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Phil. 4:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="228" href="jwpub://p/E:2017603/16-17"><em>w17.10 </em>13 ¶7-8</a></p>

Your children are the most important Bible students you will ever have, and their “coming to know” Jehovah means their eternal life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="97-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) In order for your children to learn Jehovah’s teachings, you must “speak of them” on all appropriate occasions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>) Your children will likely learn the local language at school and in their environment, but they learn your language primarily by <em>frequently </em>interacting with you in your language. Besides enabling your children to have heart-to-heart conversations with you, knowing your language gives them other advantages. Being bilingual sharpens your children’s thinking ability and enhances their social skills. <a class="xt" data-xtid="211" href="jwpub://p/E:2017402/14-15"><em>w17.05 </em>9 ¶5-6</a></p>

Barak chased Sisera’s army all the way to Harosheth​—a 15-mile (24 km) route. At some point along the way, Sisera abandoned his once frightening but now useless chariot and ran to Zaanannim, perhaps near Kedesh. He sought refuge in the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, and was welcomed by Jael. Exhausted from battle, he fell asleep. Sisera was now vulnerable to Jael’s decisive act of courage to put him to death.

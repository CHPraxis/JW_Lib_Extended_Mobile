For instance, if they notice that we are missing meetings or that our zeal is cooling off, they will no doubt quickly come to our aid. They will listen to us and then try to build us up with warm encouragement and appropriate Scriptural counsel. Do you view such help as an expression of Jehovah’s love for you? Keep in mind that elders may find that it is not easy to approach us with needed counsel. So how can you ease the load for the elders in your congregation? Be humble, approachable, and thankful. See their help as an expression of God’s love for you. This will not only benefit you but also add much joy to their work. <a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:2018328/25-26"><em>w18.03 </em>31 ¶15-16</a></p>

Parents can rejoice when a child takes to heart the thought behind today’s text. However, they should never lose sight of their goal​—to have their children become Christian disciples.

Remember that the ransom sacrifice of Christ involved the two greatest expressions of love​—the love that Jehovah showed in giving his Son in our behalf, and the love that Jesus showed by willingly offering up his life for us. Reflecting on their love should move us to love them in return. And the love for Jehovah that we and our fellow worshippers share is like a cord that ties us together and strengthens our bond of unity. <a class="xt" data-xtid="127" href="jwpub://p/E:2018243/21-21"><em>w18.01 </em>14 ¶11</a></p>

The prophets Ezekiel and Zephaniah foretold that gold and silver, staples of the commercial world through the centuries, will become worthless.

We could feel like a man who has worked all his life for a pile of money, only to learn that it is counterfeit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Prov. 18:11</a>) Yes, such riches <em>will </em>ultimately fail, so do not lose the opportunity to use them to “make friends” in heaven. Whatever we do to advance the interests of Jehovah’s Kingdom makes us spiritually rich. <a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:2017482/27-27"><em>w17.07 </em>11 ¶16</a></p>

As a result, David had to live as a fugitive, at times in a foreign country and at other times in caves in the wilderness.

The same is true of Hebrew and Greek, the languages that most of the Bible was written in. Modern Hebrew and Greek are quite different from those languages back in Bible times. So virtually everyone who wants to understand God’s Word must read a translation of it​—even those who know modern-day Hebrew or Greek. Some have felt that they should learn ancient Hebrew and Greek so that they could read the Bible in the original languages. That, however, may not be as profitable as they imagine. Thankfully, the Bible or portions of it have now been translated into nearly 3,000 languages. Clearly, Jehovah wants people of “every nation and tribe and language” to have the opportunity to benefit from his Word.

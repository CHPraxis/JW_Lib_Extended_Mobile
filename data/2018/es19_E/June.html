At times, though, discipline may involve more than counsel or oral correction. If more serious sins are involved, it may include a loss of privileges in the congregation. Even when that is the case, such discipline reflects God’s love for us. A loss of privileges, for example, can help a person realize how important it is for him to focus more on personal Bible study, meditation, and prayer. He can thus be strengthened spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7</a>) In time, privileges may be restored.

Yet, this illustration teaches us what Jehovah expects. Jesus makes it clear that Jehovah will not forgive us if we do not forgive our brothers when there is a sound basis for doing so.

But at some point he was convinced by compelling evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. How can you help build conviction in your children so that they are persuaded to believe, as Timothy was? First, be patient. Conviction does not come about overnight; nor does it pass from you to your offspring simply because <em>you </em>have been persuaded to believe.

Jehovah considers acts of loyal love expressed toward his servants as being rendered to him personally. “The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah, and He will repay him for what he does,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:17</a>. Is this scripture implying that Jehovah takes note of every act of kindness performed in behalf of lowly ones? Can we conclude that the Creator of the universe considers himself to be indebted to mere humans who perform deeds of mercy and that he views such giving as loans that he repays with favor and blessings? Yes, and this was verified by God’s own Son.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:13-42:14:14" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Luke 14:13, 14</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="174" href="jwpub://p/E:2017367/11-12"><em>w17.04 </em>29 ¶3-4</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Besides reading the Bible and our Bible-based publications, how else can we develop a deep love for Bible truth? We can enhance our love for Bible truth by regularly attending congregation meetings. The weekly study of the Bible with the help of <em>The Watchtower </em>is a principal means by which we are taught. To get the sense of the subject that is considered, we need to prepare well for each <em>Watchtower </em>Study. One way we can do so is by looking up each of the cited Bible texts. Nowadays, <em>The Watchtower </em>can be downloaded from the jw.org website or viewed on the <em>JW Library </em>app in many languages. Some electronic formats allow us to access quickly the cited texts from each study article. But whatever method we use, reading these scriptures carefully and meditating on them will deepen our love for Bible truth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="176" href="jwpub://p/E:2017405/23-23"><em>w17.05 </em>20 ¶14</a></p>

There is no way to undo a dedication vow, taking back what we promised God. If a person tires of serving Jehovah or of living a Christian way of life, he cannot claim that he was never really dedicated and that his baptism was invalid. To all intents and purposes, he presented himself as one who was wholly dedicated to God. He will be accountable before Jehovah and the congregation for any serious sins that he may commit. May it never be said of us that ‘we left the love we had at first.’ Instead, we want Jesus to be able to say of us: “I know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those you did at first.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:4-66:2:4" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Rev. 2:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:19-66:2:19" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 19</a>) May we zealously continue to live up to our dedication vow​—to Jehovah’s delight. <a class="xt" data-xtid="173" href="jwpub://p/E:2017365/21-22"><em>w17.04 </em>6-7 ¶12-13</a></p>

Abraham was convinced that Jehovah would never act unjustly by “putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one.” Such an act was “unthinkable” to Abraham. He could express such confidence because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness. In fact, the Hebrew words rendered “justice” and “righteousness” often appear together in the Hebrew Scriptures. Basically, there is no distinction between what is just and what is right. Logically, since Jehovah is the ultimate standard of righteousness, his view of matters will always be just. Further, according to his own written Word, “he loves righteousness and justice.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:5-19:33:5" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ps. 33:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="172" href="jwpub://p/E:2017362/8-9"><em>w17.04 </em>18 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">Parents, your example is essential to start your children on the path to endless life. When your children see you “seeking first the Kingdom,” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:34" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33, 34</a>) So live modestly. Sacrifice material things for spiritual benefits​—not the other way around. Strive to stay out of debt. Seek “treasure in heaven”​—Jehovah’s approval—​and not riches or “the glory of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:21-41:10:22" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Mark 10:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:43-43:12:43" data-bid="101-2" class="b"> John 12:43</a>) Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children. Let them know that you are proud of them when they decide to put Jehovah first instead of seeking prestige or riches​—for themselves or for you. Avoid the unchristian view that children should provide their parents with a life of ease. Remember, “children are not expected to save up for their parents, but the parents for their children.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:14-47:12:14" data-bid="102-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:14</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="175" href="jwpub://p/E:2017402/11-12"><em>w17.05 </em>8-9 ¶3-4</a></p>

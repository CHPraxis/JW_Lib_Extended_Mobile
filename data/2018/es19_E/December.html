Who should be among our primary guests? Those who are a regular part of our lives, the brothers and sisters in our congregation. When hard times come, will we not depend on one another? We need loyal friendships and peace with all of them. Circuit overseers and students at theocratic schools may need places to stay, as may construction volunteers. Natural disasters may leave some families homeless and in need of lodging until relief efforts can restore their dwellings. We should not assume that only those who have very comfortable homes are in a position to help; they may already have done so many times.

Why? Because many have little or no understanding of the Bible. That was true in the first century, and it is true today. So we should not assume that a person will grasp the point of a verse simply because we read it. We need to take time to isolate portions of the verse​—perhaps rereading key words—​and explain their meaning. Doing so can go a long way in helping the message of God’s Word to reach the mind and heart of our listeners.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Luke 24:32</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="410" href="jwpub://p/E:2017567/16-17"><em>w17.09 </em>25 ¶7-8</a></p>

Seek opportunities to do so! The sufferings of those struck by disasters move many to manifest compassion. Jehovah’s people are known for coming forward to help in such times of need.

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Why should you be interested in cultivating self-control? Consider two important reasons. First, it has been observed that people who are able to control their impulses generally have fewer major problems. They are more stable emotionally, they are better at forming wholesome relationships, and they are not as angry and prone to anxiety and depression as are impulsive people. Second, the ability to resist temptation and to control inappropriate impulses is fundamental to retaining God’s favor. The failure of Adam and Eve illustrates this truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 3:6</a>) And think of the sad results reaped by others who since then have failed to exercise this important quality. No imperfect human can exercise perfect self-control. Jehovah is aware of his servants’ struggles in this regard, and he wants to help them dominate their sinful tendencies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:46-11:8:50" data-bid="67-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:46-50</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="408" href="jwpub://p/E:2017561/10-11"><em>w17.09 </em>3-4 ¶3-4</a></p>

Persistent impatience weakens the bonds of love; patience strengthens them.

Additionally, the Bible urges us to <em>accept willingly the need to wait. </em>This aspect of patience is highlighted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:7-59:5:8" data-bid="74-1" class="b">James 5:7, 8</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="406" href="jwpub://p/E:2017521/12-12"><em>w17.08 </em>4 ¶4</a></p>

Can you imagine how precious that pearl was to him? The truth of God’s Kingdom is like that priceless pearl. If we love it as much as the merchant loved that pearl, we will be willing to give up everything in order to become and to remain one of the subjects of the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:28-41:10:30" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Mark 10:28-30</a>) Zacchaeus, for example, had become rich by extorting money. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:1-42:19:9" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Luke 19:1-9</a>) Yet, when that unrighteous man heard Jesus preach about the Kingdom, he recognized the excelling value of what he was hearing and took immediate action. He exclaimed: “Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone, I am restoring four times over.” He gladly gave up his ill-gotten riches and abandoned his greed for material things. <a class="xt" data-xtid="400" href="jwpub://p/E:2017442/11-13"><em>w17.06 </em>10 ¶3-5</a></p>

Moreover, those who help should avoid any conduct that could be misinterpreted by some inside or outside the congregation as morally questionable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) Parents must not merely turn their children over to others for spiritual training. They must monitor the help given by companions and continue to teach their children themselves. Parents, pray to Jehovah for help, and try your best. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:7-14:15:7" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:7</a>) Put your child’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests.

To the shock and dismay of his family and friends, he is convicted on the basis of false testimony presented by witnesses who are known to be good-for-nothing men. A sick feeling overwhelms lovers of justice as they witness the execution of that innocent man and his sons. This is not an imaginary account. This was the experience of a faithful servant of Jehovah named Naboth, who lived during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:11-11:21:13" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:26-12:9:26" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 9:26</a>) When King Ahab offered to purchase Naboth’s vineyard or to give him a better vineyard in its place, Naboth refused. Why? Naboth’s refusal was based on Jehovah’s law to the nation of Israel that forbade the permanent sale of one’s tribal inheritance.

Jehovah makes this heartwarming promise: “The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” Later in the same psalm, we read: “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="101-2" class="b"> 29</a>) Who are “the meek” and “the righteous”? The meek are those who humbly accept Jehovah’s teaching and guidance; the righteous are those who love doing what is right in the eyes of Jehovah God. In today’s world, righteous people are greatly outnumbered by the wicked. But in the new world to come, the meek and the righteous will be neither a minority nor a majority; they will be the <em>only </em>people alive. Truly, a population of such people will make the earth a paradise! <a class="xt" data-xtid="394" href="jwpub://p/E:2017361/13-14"><em>w17.04 </em>10-11 ¶5-6</a></p>

Recently, thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses had to flee conflict and persecution in eastern Ukraine. Tragically, some were killed. But most of them were taken in by their spiritual brothers elsewhere in Ukraine and in Russia. In both countries, they remain politically neutral, being “no part of the world,” and continue zealously “declaring the good news of the word.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> Acts 8:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="397" href="jwpub://p/E:2017401/15-16"><em>w17.05 </em>4 ¶6-7</a></p>

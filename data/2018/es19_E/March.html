<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Is there someone in your congregation who rubs you the wrong way? Your initial feelings about that person may be negative and can become long-lasting if nothing is done to improve them. To improve relationships, even with enemies, the Bible recommends hospitality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:21-20:25:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 25:21, 22</a>) Extending hospitality to someone can reduce friction and soften hard feelings. It can bring to the surface lovable aspects of our guest’s personality, aspects that Jehovah saw when he drew that one to the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) If extended with love, an unexpected invitation can be the start of a completely changed relationship. How can you make sure that love is your honest motive? One way is by following the encouragement given in our day’s text. Finding ways that our brothers or sisters <em>are </em>superior to us​—be it their faith, endurance, fearlessness, or some other Christian quality—​will deepen our love for them and open the way for genuine and healing hospitality. <a class="xt" data-xtid="101" href="jwpub://p/E:2018323/27-28"><em>w18.03 </em>17 ¶18-19</a></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One of the greatest tests of obedience that some parents have involves their relationship with a disfellowshipped child. Consider the example of a mother whose disfellowshipped daughter left home. The mother admits: “I looked for loopholes in our publications so that I could spend time with my daughter and my granddaughter.” She adds: “But my husband kindly helped me to see that our child was now out of our hands and that we must not interfere.” Some years later, the daughter was reinstated. “She deeply respects my husband and me because she knows that we obeyed God,” the mother says. If you have a disfellowshipped child, will you “trust in Jehovah with all your heart [and] not rely on your own understanding”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) Have faith, then, in Jehovah’s discipline and direction.

A disciple is one who learns and understands Jesus’ teachings and who is determined to observe them. Thus, the goal of all Christian parents should be to teach their children from infancy with the intention of helping them become baptized disciples of Christ. Granted, an infant would not qualify for baptism. However, the Bible shows that even relatively young children can grasp and appreciate Bible truths.

The apostle Paul wrote: “In the last days . . . , men will be <em>lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . lovers of pleasures </em>rather than lovers of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-4</a>) This self-centered kind of love is inconsistent with Christian love; it stands in contrast with it.

It can penetrate any hiding place to uncover wrongdoing among Jehovah’s people. Even if a person is able to conceal thievery from authorities, employers, elders, or parents, he cannot hide it from God, who guarantees that every theft will be exposed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>) How refreshing it is to associate with people who are ever conscious of being honest “in all things”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Heb. 13:18</a>) All forms of stealing are offensive to Jehovah. We view it as an honor to live up to Jehovah’s high moral standard, maintaining conduct that in no way brings reproach on his name. Thus, we may succeed in escaping Jehovah’s judgment against those who deliberately violate his law. <a class="xt" data-xtid="87" href="jwpub://p/E:2017606/14-15"><em>w17.10 </em>22 ¶6-7</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Succumbing to discouragement can weaken our faith and cause our love for God to grow cold. In this wicked system controlled by Satan, all of us at times face discouraging circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="90-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Perhaps we are presently confronted with problems caused by old age, poor health, or economic pressures. Or we may be struggling with feelings of inadequacy, with unfulfilled expectations, or with personal failings. Yet, we should never allow such circumstances or feelings to convince us that Jehovah has left us. Instead, we should meditate on reassuring words about Jehovah’s enduring love for us. We find such words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:23-19:136:23" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Psalm 136:23</a>, which states: “He remembered us when we were low, for his loyal love endures forever.” Indeed, Jehovah’s loyal love for his servants is constant. Therefore, we can be sure that he hears our “pleas for help” and responds to them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:1-19:116:1" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ps. 116:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:24-19:136:26" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 136:24-26</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="68" href="jwpub://p/E:2017405/16-16"><em>w17.05 </em>18 ¶8</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>) Despite his firsthand knowledge of Jehovah’s thinking on the matter, Peter feared the opinion of the circumcised Jewish members of the congregation in Jerusalem. The apostle Paul confronted Peter in Antioch and exposed his hypocrisy.

Evidently, Peter humbly accepted Paul’s corrective counsel. There is no indication in the Scriptures that he lost his privileges. In fact, Peter was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible. Jesus, who is head of the congregation, continued to use him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:22" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Eph. 1:22</a>) Members of the congregation thus had an opportunity to imitate Jesus and his Father by extending forgiveness. It is to be hoped that no one allowed himself to be stumbled by an imperfect man’s mistake. <a class="xt" data-xtid="66" href="jwpub://p/E:2017370/27-30"><em>w17.04 </em>27 ¶16-18</a></p>

Even so, it was an emotionally difficult situation for father and daughter​—a real sacrifice for both of them. When he saw her, Jephthah “ripped his garments” and said that his heart was broken. His daughter ‘wept over her virginity.’ Why? Jephthah had no son, and his only daughter would never be able to marry and bear him grandchildren. There would be no way to pass on the family name and legacy. That was not the most important consideration, though. Jephthah said: “I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I am unable to turn back.” And his daughter replied: “Do to me as you have promised.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:35-7:11:39" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Judg. 11:35-39</a>) These were loyal individuals who would never have thought of breaking a vow that was made to the Most High God​—no matter what it cost them personally.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:21-5:23:21" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Deut. 23:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:23-5:23:23" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:4-19:15:4" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> Ps. 15:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="65" href="jwpub://p/E:2017365/13-14"><em>w17.04 </em>4 ¶5-6</a></p>

Then, he was falsely accused of trying to rape his master’s wife and ended up in irons in prison.

Did he lose confidence in his God, Jehovah? No. What helped Joseph to wait patiently? It was his faith in Jehovah. He saw Jehovah’s hand in matters. Notice how this is reflected in what he told his brothers: “Although you meant to harm me, God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive, as he is doing today.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:50:19-1:50:20" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Gen. 50:19, 20</a>) Ultimately, Joseph realized that the wait was worth it. <a class="xt" data-xtid="75" href="jwpub://p/E:2017521/14-14"><em>w17.08 </em>4 ¶6;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:2017521/21-22"> 6 ¶12-13</a></p>

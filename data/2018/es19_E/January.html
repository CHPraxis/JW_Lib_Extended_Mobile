Hospitality is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness. But you may wonder, ‘Why would anyone hold back?’ There could be a number of reasons. One is that Jehovah’s servants are very busy and often have multiple commitments. Some may feel that they simply do not have the time or energy to show hospitality. If that is your situation, it may be that you need to examine your current schedule of activities. Could you make some adjustments so that you will have time and energy to accept or offer hospitality? The Scriptures urge Christians to extend hospitality. It is not wrong to make time for this; actually, it is the right thing to do. You may, of course, need to be willing to limit some optional activities. <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2018323/22-23"><em>w18.03 </em>16 ¶13-14</a></p>

But in a few years when the urge to have sex becomes stronger, he or she needs to be thoroughly convinced that obeying Jehovah’s laws is always the best choice.” Even those who got baptized as adults face many unanticipated tests of faith.

Anger can cause such physical problems as high blood pressure and respiratory trouble. It can affect the liver and the pancreas, and it can cause digestive problems. When we are angry, we do not always think clearly. And at times a fit of anger may be followed by a prolonged period of depression.

One day, she soiled her clothes. As she was trying to clean up, the doorbell rang. The visitors turned out to be two Witnesses who regularly called on the woman. The sisters asked if there was anything they could do to help. “It is embarrassing but yes,” the woman replied. The visitors helped her to clean up. Then they made her a cup of tea and stayed for a chat.

One way that Paul demonstrated appreciation for the ministry was by being alert to opportunities to speak to others. Like the apostles and early Christians, we preach informally, publicly, and from house to house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Acts 5:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 20:20</a>) As our circumstances allow, we look for ways to expand our ministry, perhaps by serving as an auxiliary or a regular pioneer. We might also learn another language, move to another area in our own country, or even move to another land.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:9-44:16:10" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Acts 16:9, 10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:2017442/17-18"><em>w17.06 </em>10-11 ¶8-9</a></p>

What about greedy corporations that pollute the environment, deplete natural resources, and exploit the gullibility of consumers in order to bring untold wealth to a few while millions struggle in poverty?

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">One facet of the sign that Jesus gave regarding “the conclusion of the system of things” was that “the love of the greater number [would] grow cold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3</a>) In the first century, the Jews, who claimed to be God’s people, allowed their love for God to grow cold. On the other hand, most Christians at that time kept busy “declaring the good news about the Christ” and showing love for God, for fellow Christians, and for unbelievers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:44-44:2:47" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Acts 2:44-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> 5:42</a>) Nevertheless, some of Jesus’ followers in the first century did allow their love to grow cold. Speaking to first-century Christians living in Ephesus, the resurrected Jesus Christ said: “I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:4-66:2:4" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Rev. 2:4</a>) What may have been one reason for this?

Besides worshipping the same God, what could Judge Jephthah and Elkanah’s wife Hannah possibly have in common? Each was under a vow to God, and they both faithfully paid their vow to him. They are excellent examples for men and women today who choose to make vows to Jehovah. As used in the Bible, a vow is a solemn promise that is made to God. A person promises to perform some act, to offer some gift, to enter some type of service, or to abstain from certain things. Vows are made voluntarily, of one’s own free will. Nevertheless, they are sacred and binding in God’s eyes because they carry the force of an oath​—a sworn statement—​that promises that a person will or will not do a certain thing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:22-1:14:23" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Gen. 14:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:16-58:6:17" data-bid="113-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:16, 17</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:2017365/8-9"><em>w17.04 </em>3 ¶1-2</a></p>

Noah faithfully fulfilled the work assignment that Jehovah had given him. Yes, visible acts of faith led to the preservation of Noah and his family through the Flood. Just as the ark amounted to evidence of Noah’s faith, baptism before onlookers provides visible evidence. It shows that a Christian disciple has dedicated himself to Jehovah on the basis of faith in Christ. Like Noah, dedicated disciples obediently carry on in the work that God has assigned them to do. Just as Noah was preserved through the Flood, loyal baptized ones will be preserved when the present wicked world meets its end.

However, it would be a mistake to conclude that by not being baptized, a child is not accountable to Jehovah. Why is that? Accountability to Jehovah is not founded on the act of getting baptized.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:17-59:4:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 4:17</a>) Thus, rather than discourage a child from getting baptized, wise parents work hard to set the right example.

Rather, hold your songbook up high, lift your head, and sing with heartfelt expression! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:11-15:3:11" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ezra 3:11</a>) Today, in many Kingdom Halls, the words of the songs are shown on screens, which helps us to sing out. It is also of interest that the singing of Kingdom songs has been made part of the Kingdom Ministry School curriculum for elders. This emphasizes the need for elders to take the lead in congregation singing. One factor that keeps many from singing with a full voice is fear. It may be fear of possibly sounding unpleasant to others. However, we should keep in mind that when we speak, “we all stumble many times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) Yet, that does not stop us from speaking.

Jehovah had guaranteed that he would hold dishonest people accountable for their wicked deeds. This promise surely strengthened Zechariah. Yet, nothing had really changed. Dishonesty and other wicked practices were still present, and the rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem was far from complete. How could the Jews have abandoned their divinely appointed task so quickly? Had they returned to their homeland simply to further their own interests? Jehovah knew what his people needed. God gave Zechariah a final vision to assure the Jews of His love and appreciation for all that they had done so far and to guarantee protection for them if they would return to His work. In connection with rebuilding the temple, Jehovah made a promise​—the words of today’s text. <a class="xt" data-xtid="269" href="jwpub://p/E:2017607/8-8"><em>w17.10 </em>26 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="268" href="jwpub://p/E:2017607/12-12"> 27 ¶5</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:12-9:1:12" data-bid="97-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:12</a>) She trusted that Jehovah would either put an end to her barrenness or fill the lack in some other way. Trials and tribulations will continue as long as we are imperfect and are in this system under Satan’s control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) How good it is to know, though, that Jehovah is “the God of all comfort”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>) One way that we can receive help to deal with our personal trials or tribulations is through prayer. Hannah poured out her heart to Jehovah. Similarly, in the face of tribulation, we need to do more than simply <em>mention </em>to Jehovah how we feel. We need to <em>supplicate him, </em>yes, to convey our feelings by praying intensely from the heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="254" href="jwpub://p/E:2017441/19-20"><em>w17.06 </em>6 ¶10-11</a></p>

To what was Jesus referring? Peter was quite attached to fishing. So it seems that Jesus was asking him where his true affection lay. Did he have greater affection for the fish and the fishing business than for Jesus and the things that he taught? In answer, Peter said: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:15" data-bid="103-1" class="b">John 21:15</a>) Peter certainly lived up to his word.

Such a situation can test our faith in Jehovah and in his organizational arrangement. How will humility protect you if you face such a test? Consider two ways. First, humility will move us to acknowledge that we do not have all the facts. No matter how much we know of a situation, only Jehovah can read a person’s figurative heart. Our awareness of this undeniable truth will prompt us to be humble, to recognize our limitations, and to adjust our view of the matter. Second, humility will help us to be submissive and patient as we wait on Jehovah to correct any true injustice. It is as the wise man wrote: “It will not turn out well for the wicked one, nor will he prolong his days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:12-21:8:13" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:12, 13</a>) Certainly, a humble response is in the best spiritual interests of all concerned.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:5-60:5:5" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="251" href="jwpub://p/E:2017370/20-21"><em>w17.04 </em>25-26 ¶10-11</a></p>

Certainly not. He was keenly aware that he was the victim of many injustices. He clearly explained the facts to the cupbearer, who perhaps would be in a position to assist him. Note, however, that there is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that Joseph ever told anyone​—not even Pharaoh—​that his brothers were his kidnappers. In fact, when his brothers came to Egypt and were reconciled with Joseph, Pharaoh welcomed them and invited them to make their home in Egypt and to enjoy “the best of all the land.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:16-1:45:20" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Gen. 45:16-20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="249" href="jwpub://p/E:2017362/21-22"><em>w17.04 </em>20-21 ¶12-13</a></p>

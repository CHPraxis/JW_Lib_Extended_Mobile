The jailer, fearing that the prisoners had escaped, was on the verge of committing suicide when Paul called out to him. Paul and Silas were able to give a fine witness to the jailer and his family.

Indeed, the meaning behind “discipline” primarily relates to education, such as that involved in raising a beloved child. As members of the Christian congregation, we are part of God’s household. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:15-54:3:15" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:15</a>) We therefore respect Jehovah’s right both to set standards and to give loving discipline when we violate them.

A Bible translation that was easily understood when first produced may later become less effective. Consider an example involving a Bible translation into English. The <em>King James Version </em>was first produced in 1611. It became one of the most popular English Bibles, and it would come to have a significant impact on the English language. Even so, much of the wording in the <em>King James Version </em>became archaic over the centuries. The same is true of early Bible translations in other languages. Are we not grateful, then, to have the modern-language <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures? </em>This translation is available in whole or in part in over 150 languages, thus being available to a vast part of the population today. Its clear wording allows the message of God’s Word to reach our heart. <a class="xt" data-xtid="153" href="jwpub://p/E:2017566/13-14"><em>w17.09 </em>19 ¶5-6</a></p>

And there will be an economic impact to consider, both immediate and long-term. More adjustments become necessary when the baby arrives. The new mother’s time and attention may be focused on caring for her child. Many a husband has felt left out because his wife is occupied with her duties toward their baby. On the other hand, a new father has new responsibilities to shoulder. His duties increase because he has a new family member to care for and provide for. A different sort of tribulation confronts some married couples. They desperately want children but remain childless. When the wife does not become pregnant, she may feel much emotional distress. <a class="xt" data-xtid="143" href="jwpub://p/E:2017441/8-8"><em>w17.06 </em>4 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="142" href="jwpub://p/E:2017441/13-14"> 5 ¶5-6</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">As Christians, we cherish and embrace truth. God’s Word is the ultimate source of truth. In prayer to his Father, Jesus said: “Your word is truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="89-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) Therefore, love for truth starts with gaining an accurate knowledge of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:10" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>) However, more is involved than simply acquiring head knowledge. Note how the inspired writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> helps us to understand what it means to love Bible truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:100" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ps. 119:97-100</a>) Do we take the time to ponder, or dwell on, Scriptural passages throughout the day? Our appreciation for Bible truth will grow when we meditate on ways we benefit from applying it in our lives. Also, we can savor the tasty Bible-based spiritual food that we receive from God’s organization. We can allow it to linger on our figurative palate so that we can recall the “delightful words” of truth and use them to help others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:10-21:12:10" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="141" href="jwpub://p/E:2017405/20-21"><em>w17.05 </em>19-20 ¶11-12</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:9-19:146:9" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Ps. 146:9</a>) A Christian sister related that her family fled the persecution in Eritrea. After four of her children made an exhausting eight-day journey across the desert, they arrived in Sudan. She said: “The brothers there treated them like close relatives, providing food, clothes, shelter, and transportation. Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God?

In such a situation, will we reflect Jehovah’s view of justice? For example, how will you respond if an elder makes a remark that hints at a degree of prejudice? Will you allow yourself to be stumbled if an elder thoughtlessly makes a statement that offends or hurts you? Rather than quickly concluding that the brother no longer qualifies as an elder, will you patiently wait on Jesus, the head of the congregation? Will you put forth the effort to see the bigger picture, perhaps reflecting on the brother’s many years of faithful service? If a brother who sins against you continues to serve as an elder or even receives additional privileges, will you rejoice with him? Your willingness to forgive may well reflect Jehovah’s view of justice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Matt. 6:14, 15</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="138" href="jwpub://p/E:2017370/30-30"><em>w17.04 </em>27 ¶18</a></p>

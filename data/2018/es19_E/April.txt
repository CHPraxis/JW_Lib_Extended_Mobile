He gave gifts in men.​—Eph. 4:8.



How can we benefit from those precious gifts? One way is to imitate the faith of the elders as well as their fine example. Another way is to heed their Scriptural counsel. (Heb. 13:7, 17) Remember, the elders love us and want us to grow spiritually. For instance, if they notice that we are missing meetings or that our zeal is cooling off, they will no doubt quickly come to our aid. They will listen to us and then try to build us up with warm encouragement and appropriate Scriptural counsel. Do you view such help as an expression of Jehovah’s love for you? Keep in mind that elders may find that it is not easy to approach us with needed counsel. So how can you ease the load for the elders in your congregation? Be humble, approachable, and thankful. See their help as an expression of God’s love for you. This will not only benefit you but also add much joy to their work. w18.03 31 ¶15-16

Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.​—Prov. 27:11.



Each child is unique; not all children become mature at the same rate or at the same point in life. Some have a good measure of mental and emotional maturity at a young age and express a desire to get baptized. Others may not be ready for baptism until they are a bit older. Thus, discerning parents do not pressure their children to get baptized. Rather, they assist each child to make spiritual advancement in keeping with his or her own growth and progress. Parents can rejoice when a child takes to heart the thought behind today’s text. However, they should never lose sight of their goal​—to have their children become Christian disciples. With that in mind, parents will want to consider the question, ‘Does my child have sufficient knowledge to make a dedication to God and get baptized?’ w18.03 9 ¶6

He does not go back on his promise, even when it is bad for him.​—Ps. 15:4.



If we accept an invitation, we should not cancel frivolously. Our host may well have made preparations, and all his effort may be for nothing if we cancel. (Matt. 5:37) Some have at times canceled a previous invitation in order to accept a seemingly better one. Would that be loving and respectful? Rather, we should accept hospitality with genuine appreciation for whatever our hosts have to offer. (Luke 10:7) And if truly unavoidable circumstances force us to cancel, it would be loving and considerate to let our hosts know as soon as possible. It is also important to respect local customs. In some cultures, unexpected guests are welcome; in others, prior arrangements are preferred. And in some cultures, it is expected that guests politely decline the first invitation or two; in others, to decline comes across as unappreciative. Let us do our utmost to make our hosts happy that they invited us. w18.03 18 ¶20-21




Thursday, April 4

Press on to maturity.​—Heb. 6:1.



Keep in mind that having knowledge of the Bible is not enough to become a spiritually-minded person. (1 Ki. 4:29, 30; 11:4-6) So in addition to Bible knowledge, what is needed? We need to continue to make spiritual progress. (Col. 2:6, 7) One important step is to study the publication “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” Completing your study of that book will help you to see how to apply Bible principles in your life. If you have already finished studying that book, can you move on to other study materials that can help you to stabilize your faith? (Col. 1:23) Do you prayerfully meditate on how you can apply in your life what you are studying? Keep in mind that as we study and meditate, we should do so with the goal of developing a heartfelt desire to please Jehovah and obey his laws. (Ps. 40:8; 119:97) At the same time, we work to reject things that will hinder our spiritual growth.​—Titus 2:11, 12. w18.02 24-25 ¶7-9




Friday, April 5

[Noah] became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.​—Heb. 11:7.



To cultivate faith like Noah’s, we need to be good students of God’s Word, to take to heart what we learn, and to let that knowledge mold us and guide us. (1 Pet. 1:13-15) Then faith and godly wisdom will protect us from Satan’s clever designs and from the world’s evil spirit. (2 Cor. 2:11) That spirit fosters a love for violence and immorality. And it impels people to focus on fleshly desires. (1 John 2:15, 16) It may even move the spiritually weak to ignore the evidence of the closeness of God’s great day. Note that when Jesus compared our time with Noah’s, he focused, not on violence or immorality, but on the dangers of spiritual apathy. (Matt. 24:36-39) Ask yourself: ‘Does my way of life indicate that I truly know Jehovah? Does my faith impel me not only to live in harmony with God’s righteous standards but also to proclaim them?’ May your answers show that you too ‘walk with the true God.’​—Gen. 6:9. w18.02 9-10 ¶8-10




Saturday, April 6

From these turn away.​—2 Tim. 3:5.



We cannot completely avoid people with ungodly traits. We might have to work with them, go to school with them, or live with them. But we can avoid being drawn into their thinking and imitating their characteristics. We do this by strengthening our spirituality through Bible study and close association with those who are determined to serve Jehovah. We should also strive to help others spiritually. Look for opportunities to witness, asking Jehovah to help you say the right thing at the right time. We should let others know that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses. That way, our fine conduct will bring glory to God and not to us. We have been trained “to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things.” (Titus 2:11-14) If we conduct ourselves in a godly way, others will observe us, and some may even say: “We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.”​—Zech. 8:23. w18.01 31 ¶17-18




Sunday, April 7

Men will be lovers of themselves.​—2 Tim. 3:2.



Is it wrong for us to love ourselves? No, it is normal, even necessary, to have a healthy love of self. Jehovah designed us that way. Jesus said: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Mark 12:31) If we do not love ourselves, we cannot love our neighbor. We also read in the Scriptures: “Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it.” (Eph. 5:28, 29) So a proper love of self is desirable. The love of self mentioned at 2 Timothy 3:2 is a distorted, selfish love. People who love themselves excessively think more of themselves than it is necessary for them to think. (Rom. 12:3) Their main interest in life is themselves. They care little about others. When things go wrong, they tend to blame others rather than accept responsibility. Such self-centered people are not truly happy. w18.01 23 ¶4-5




Monday, April 8

Show yourselves thankful.​—Col. 3:15.



While personal study is one way we listen to Jehovah, prayer is a way in which we speak to him. A Christian should not view prayer as a meaningless ritual; nor is it a ‘good luck charm’ to increase the chances of success at some endeavor. Rather, prayer is real communication with our Creator. Jehovah wants to hear from you. (Phil. 4:6) When you experience any kind of anxiety, the Bible’s wise advice is to “throw your burden on Jehovah.” (Ps. 55:22) Do you really believe that? There are millions of brothers and sisters who can assure you that it has helped them. It can help you too! Prayer offers you the opportunity to do more than simply ask Jehovah for help. Sometimes we can become so consumed by our problems that we overlook the many blessings we have. Why not determine that each day you will think of at least three things for which you can be thankful? Then thank Jehovah in prayer for those blessings. w17.12 25-26 ¶10-11




Tuesday, April 9

From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation.​—2 Tim. 3:15.



Thousands of Bible students make their dedication to Jehovah and get baptized. Many are young people who have been raised in the truth and who have chosen the best way of life. (Ps. 1:1-3) If you are a Christian parent, you no doubt look forward to the day when your son or daughter will get baptized. (Compare 3 John 4.) As a Christian parent, you want your child to know the holy writings, which today include the Hebrew Scriptures as well as the Christian Greek Scriptures. Depending on their ability, even very young children can gain a basic education about the people and events of the Bible. Jehovah’s organization has provided a number of tools that parents can use to help their children. Remember, knowledge of the Scriptures is the foundation on which a strong relationship with Jehovah is built. w17.12 18 ¶1; 19 ¶4




Wednesday, April 10

A husband is head of his wife.​—Eph. 5:23.



What if you are a wife and you feel that your unbelieving husband does not treat you properly? Would you improve the situation by arguing about his behavior? Even if you succeed in making him do what you want, will you win him over to the truth? Not likely. But if you show respect for your husband’s headship, you can contribute to peace in the family, you will praise Jehovah, and you may even win your husband over to true worship; thus you both may gain the prize. (1 Pet. 3:1, 2) What if you are a husband and you feel that your unbelieving wife does not respect you? Would you move her to show you more respect if you were to shout at her to show her who is boss? Absolutely not! God expects you to exercise headship lovingly, in imitation of Jesus. Jesus exercises his headship over his congregation with loving patience. (Luke 9:46-48) By imitating Jesus’ example, a husband may win his wife over to true worship. w17.11 28-29 ¶13-14




Thursday, April 11

The one who constructed all things is God.​—Heb. 3:4.



Worldly thinking ignores or belittles Jehovah’s guidelines, and its influence could gradually weaken our faith. Today, we all are exposed to worldly thinking. It is promoted on television, on the Internet, at work, or at school. In many countries, it is not unusual to hear people say that they do not believe in God; they consider themselves to be nonreligious. They may not have examined the question of God’s existence carefully, but they are drawn to the idea of being free to do as they please. (Ps. 10:4) Others may feel worldly-wise when they say, “I can have high principles without believing in God.” Is the claim of unbelievers that there is no Creator based on logical reasoning? When looking to science to determine whether life was created, a person can easily get lost in a fog of information. But in reality, the answer is simple. If a building needs someone to construct it, how much more so do living things! w17.11 20-21 ¶2-4




Friday, April 12

A book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah and for those meditating on his name.​—Mal. 3:16.



Reflect on the importance of attending the Memorial. Remember, congregation meetings are part of our worship. Surely Jehovah and Jesus take note of who makes the effort to attend this most important meeting of the year. Frankly, we want them to see that unless it is physically or circumstantially impossible, we will be present at the Memorial. When we show by our actions that meetings for worship are important to us, we give Jehovah added reason to keep our name in his “book of remembrance”​—“the book of life”—​in which the names of those who are in line to attain to everlasting life are inscribed. (Rev. 20:15) In the days leading up to the Memorial, we can set aside time to examine prayerfully and carefully our personal relationship with Jehovah.​—2 Cor. 13:5. w18.01 13 ¶4-5




Saturday, April 13

He must flee to one of these cities.​—Josh. 20:4.



Once inside a city of refuge, the fugitive was safe. Regarding those cities, Jehovah said: “They will serve as a refuge for you.” (Josh. 20:2, 3) Jehovah did not require the manslayer to be judged again for the same case; nor was the avenger of blood permitted to enter the city and take the fugitive’s life. The fugitive thus never had to fear reprisal. While in the city, he was safe and secure under Jehovah’s protection. This was not a prison of refuge. The city offered him an opportunity to work, to help others, and to serve Jehovah in peace. Yes, a happy and fulfilling life was possible! Some of God’s people who sinned grievously but who repented have felt “imprisoned” by their guilt, even feeling that Jehovah will forever view them as tainted by gross wrongdoing. If you feel that way, please be assured that when Jehovah forgives you, you can feel secure in his mercy! w17.11 9 ¶6; 11 ¶13-14




Sunday, April 14

How good and how pleasant it is . . . to dwell together in unity!​—Ps. 133:1.



One way we can promote unity is by reflecting on the meaning of the emblems used at the Memorial. Prior to that special night​—and especially on that night—​give serious thought to the significance of the unleavened bread and the red wine. (1 Cor. 11:23-25) The bread represents the sinless body of Jesus offered in sacrifice, and the wine pictures his shed blood. Remember that the ransom sacrifice of Christ involved the two greatest expressions of love​—the love that Jehovah showed in giving his Son in our behalf, and the love that Jesus showed by willingly offering up his life for us. Reflecting on their love should move us to love them in return. And the love for Jehovah that we and our fellow worshippers share is like a cord that ties us together and strengthens our bond of unity. w18.01 14 ¶11

By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him.​—1 John 4:9.



Jehovah deeply loves and values mankind. He was willing to use the blood of his Son to make possible our eternal salvation. (John 3:16) Were Jehovah to fail to fulfill his promises, the Devil would have an excuse to call God a liar who withholds good and thus rules in an unfair way. It would also vindicate opposers who mockingly ask: “Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning.” (2 Pet. 3:3, 4) Hence, Jehovah will see to it that the vindication of his sovereignty includes the salvation of obedient humans! (Isa. 55:10, 11) Furthermore, Jehovah’s love characterizes his sovereignty. So we can be sure that he will always love, value, and appreciate his loyal servants.​—Ex. 34:6. w17.06 23 ¶7

[God] loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.​—1 John 4:10.



From the moment that Jehovah promised a future Savior, as recorded at Genesis 3:15, He viewed this sacrifice as already made. Then, some 4,000 years later, Jehovah at great personal cost sacrificed his only-begotten Son for the world of mankind. (John 3:16) How grateful we are for Jehovah’s unselfish love! We are able to show unselfish love because God created us in his image. Abel showed love for God by unselfishly offering the best of what he had. (Gen. 4:3, 4) Noah displayed unselfish love for his fellow man by preaching God’s message for decades despite not seeing any response from the people. (2 Pet. 2:5) Abraham put his love for God ahead of his own feelings when he was commanded to offer up his son Isaac. (Jas. 2:21) Like those faithful men, we want to show love, despite the challenges we face. w17.10 7-8 ¶3-4

We do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin.​—Heb. 4:15.



The services of our High Priest, Jesus, reassure us that our sins can be forgiven and that “we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time.” (Heb. 4:16) Therefore, exercise faith in Jesus’ sacrifice. Have faith that the ransom applies to you. (Gal. 2:20, 21) Have faith that the ransom is the basis for forgiving your sins. Have faith that the ransom offers you the hope of eternal life. Jesus’ sacrifice is Jehovah’s gift to you. And once Jehovah has forgiven our sins, we do not need to fear that he is looking for a reason to bring up those sins again or to judge us for them. (Ps. 103:8-12) Yes, we can be completely confident of Jehovah’s forgiveness. w17.11 11-12 ¶14-17

I make request . . . concerning those putting faith in me through their word, so that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me.​—John 17:20, 21.



On the night of the first Lord’s Evening Meal, Jesus prayed that his followers would all be united and that they would enjoy the same unity that he and his Father treasure. Jehovah has indeed answered that prayer of his dear Son, and now millions believe that Jehovah sent his Son. The Memorial, like no other meeting of God’s people, provides undeniable evidence of the unity of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In some areas, the gathering of different races at a religious meeting is unheard of or is looked down on by others. But such unity is beautiful in the eyes of Jehovah and Jesus! As Jehovah’s people, we are not surprised at the unity we enjoy. Jehovah, in fact, foretold it.​—Ezek. 37:15-17; Zech. 8:23. w18.01 14 ¶7-9

The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.​—Ps. 118:22.



“The builders,” the Jewish leaders, rejected the Messiah. Their rejection was far more than just turning their backs on Jesus or refusing to accept him as the Christ. Many Jews rejected him to the point of clamoring for his death. (Luke 23:18-23) Yes, they contributed to Jesus’ being killed. If Jesus was rejected and killed, how could he become “the chief cornerstone”? That could come about only by his being resurrected to life again. The apostle Peter spoke of “Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you executed on a stake but whom God raised up from the dead.” (Acts 3:15; 4:5-11; 1 Pet. 2:5-7) This resurrected Son thus became the only one whose name was “given among men by which we must get saved.”​—Acts 4:12; Eph. 1:20. w17.12 9-10 ¶6-9

Keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he comes.​—1 Cor. 11:26.



Regarding the great tribulation just ahead of us, Jesus said: “They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And [Jesus] will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together.” (Matt. 24:29-31) This ‘gathering of chosen ones’ refers to the time when all anointed Christians who still remain on earth will receive their heavenly reward. It will happen after the initial part of the great tribulation has passed but before the battle of Armageddon. Then all of the 144,000 will share with Jesus in conquering the kings of the earth. (Rev. 17:12-14) The last Memorial that is observed prior to this gathering of the anointed to heaven will be the final one, for Jesus will have ‘come.’ w18.01 16 ¶15

God resurrected this Jesus.​—Acts 2:32.



In heaven, Jesus lives “forever and ever,” never seeing corruption. (Rev. 1:5, 18; Rom. 6:9; Col. 1:18; 1 Pet. 3:18) He had assured his faithful apostles that they would rule with him in heaven. (Luke 22:28-30) Paul wrote that “Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death.” Paul went on to indicate that there would be others raised to heavenly life, adding: “Each one in his own proper order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.” (1 Cor. 15:20, 23) Since 1914 we have been living during Jesus’ promised “presence.” It is still continuing, and the end of this wicked system of things is now very near. w17.12 10 ¶11; 11 ¶14-16

I myself am the One comforting you.​—Isa. 51:12.



Our Father of tender mercies has himself experienced the loss of loved ones, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and King David. (Num. 12:6-8; Matt. 22:31, 32; Acts 13:22) God’s Word assures us that Jehovah has eagerly anticipated​—has had an earnest longing for—​the time when he will bring them back to life. (Job 14:14, 15) They will be happy and in vibrant health. Consider, too, that God’s dearly beloved Son​—“the one he was especially fond of”—​died an agonizing death. (Prov. 8:22, 30) Words cannot express the pain Jehovah must have suffered. (John 5:20; 10:17) We can have unwavering confidence that Jehovah will act in our behalf. We should therefore not hesitate to pour out our hearts to him in prayer concerning our personal grief. How comforting it is to know that Jehovah understands our pain and provides the comfort that we so sorely need!​—2 Cor. 1:3, 4. w17.07 13 ¶3-5

God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.​—Heb. 6:10.



Today, millions are moved from the heart to contribute their “valuable things,” which include their time, energy, and resources in support of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. (Prov. 3:9) The work and the love we show for Jehovah will never be forgotten by him. All that has been accomplished for true worship in these last days is tangible evidence of Jehovah’s blessing and Christ’s leadership. We are part of a stable, secure, and everlasting organization. Cherish your place among Jehovah’s people, and “do not fail to listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.” (Zech. 6:15) Then you can remain under the protection of our King and High Priest. Have as full a share as possible in supporting true worship. As you do so, you can be certain that Jehovah of armies will keep you safe and secure during the remainder of this system of things​—and for eternity! w17.10 30 ¶18-19

Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.​—Luke 16:9.



In the near future, Satan’s entire system​—political, religious, and commercial—​is destined to fail. The prophets Ezekiel and Zephaniah foretold that gold and silver, staples of the commercial world through the centuries, will become worthless. (Ezek. 7:19; Zeph. 1:18) How would we feel if we reached the end of our life in this world and realized that we had sacrificed true riches for a vast store of this world’s “unrighteous riches”? We could feel like a man who has worked all his life for a pile of money, only to learn that it is counterfeit. (Prov. 18:11) Yes, such riches will ultimately fail, so do not lose the opportunity to use them to “make friends” in heaven. Whatever we do to advance the interests of Jehovah’s Kingdom makes us spiritually rich. w17.07 11 ¶16




Thursday, April 25

Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved us and gave himself for us.​—Eph. 5:1, 2.



Some Christians who have committed a serious sin try to cover it over in order to avoid embarrassing themselves or disappointing others. (Prov. 28:13) Yet, such a course is unloving, for it harms not only the sinner but also others. It can hinder the flow of God’s spirit and threaten the peace of the entire congregation. (Eph. 4:30) Genuine love moves Christians who have committed serious sins to speak to the elders so that the elders can provide the needed help. (Jas. 5:14, 15) Love is the greatest of all qualities. (1 Cor. 13:13) It identifies us as Jesus’ followers and as imitators of Jehovah, the Source of love. “If I . . . do not have love,” wrote Paul, “I am nothing.” (1 Cor. 13:2) May we continue to show our love not just “in word” but also “in deed and truth.”​—1 John 3:18. w17.10 11 ¶17-18




Friday, April 26

We must obey God as ruler rather than men.​—Acts 5:29.



Consider the courage Joseph showed when Potiphar’s wife tempted him to commit sexual immorality. He must have known that he could face severe consequences if he refused her. Even so, rather than give in, he showed courage and took decisive action. (Gen. 39:10, 12) Rahab is another example of courage. When Israelite spies went to her home in Jericho, she courageously hid the two men and helped them to get away safely. (Josh. 2:4, 5, 9, 12-16) When opposed by the Sadducees, the faithful apostles, who had seen the courage that Jesus displayed, would not stop teaching on the basis of Jesus’ name. (Acts 5:17, 18, 27-29) Joseph, Rahab, Jesus, and the apostles displayed an inner strength that motivated them to perform good works. Their courage was not overconfidence. It came from reliance on Jehovah. We too face circumstances that require courage. Rather than rely on ourselves, we must rely on Jehovah.​—2 Tim. 1:7. w17.09 29 ¶6-9




Saturday, April 27

Strip off the old personality with its practices.​—Col. 3:9.



Stripping off old personality traits cannot be done in one’s own strength. Often, individuals who did so had to fight hard to put away their bad practices. They gained the victory by opening their mind and heart to the power of God’s Word and his holy spirit. (Luke 11:13; Heb. 4:12) To benefit from that power, we must read the Bible daily, meditate on it, and pray constantly for the wisdom and strength to apply Bible counsel. (Josh. 1:8; Ps. 119:97; 1 Thess. 5:17) We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24, 25) In addition, we want to make good use of the various means by which spiritual food is now made available to God’s people worldwide. (Luke 12:42) While Christians must strip off the old personality, that is not all that is required to gain God’s approval. We must also clothe ourselves with the new personality.​—Col. 3:10. w17.08 21 ¶16-17

As for me, I trust in your loyal love; my heart will rejoice in your acts of salvation.​—Ps. 13:5.



King David was the victim of many injustices. Although anointed by Jehovah at an early age to be the future king of Israel, David had to wait some 15 years before he was made king over his own tribe. (2 Sam. 2:3, 4) During part of this time, unfaithful King Saul pursued David, seeking to kill him. As a result, David had to live as a fugitive, at times in a foreign country and at other times in caves in the wilderness. Even when Saul was eventually killed in battle, David still had to wait about seven more years before he was given the kingship over the whole nation of Israel. (2 Sam. 5:4, 5) Why was David willing to wait patiently? He trusted in Jehovah’s loyal love. He joyfully looked forward to deliverance, and he reflected on how Jehovah had dealt rewardingly with him. (Ps. 13:6) Yes, David felt that the wait would be worth it. w17.08 6 ¶14-15




Monday, April 29

God is not partial.​—Acts 10:34.



Over time, languages tend to change. Words and expressions may come to mean something completely different. The same is true of Hebrew and Greek, the languages that most of the Bible was written in. Modern Hebrew and Greek are quite different from those languages back in Bible times. So virtually everyone who wants to understand God’s Word must read a translation of it​—even those who know modern-day Hebrew or Greek. Some have felt that they should learn ancient Hebrew and Greek so that they could read the Bible in the original languages. That, however, may not be as profitable as they imagine. Thankfully, the Bible or portions of it have now been translated into nearly 3,000 languages. Clearly, Jehovah wants people of “every nation and tribe and language” to have the opportunity to benefit from his Word. (Rev. 14:6, ftn.) Does that not draw you even closer to our loving and impartial God? w17.09 19 ¶4




Tuesday, April 30

A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a discerning man will remain calm.​—Prov. 17:27.



If you have disfellowshipped relatives, you may need to control your feelings in order to avoid unnecessary contact with them. Self-restraint in such situations is easier if we realize that our actions are in line with God’s example and in harmony with his counsel. A notable example is King David. He wielded great power but refrained from using it out of anger when provoked by Saul and Shimei. (1 Sam. 26:9-11; 2 Sam. 16:5-10) That is not to say that David always controlled himself, as we know from his sin with Bath-sheba and his initial reaction to Nabal’s greed. (1 Sam. 25:10-13; 2 Sam. 11:2-4) Nevertheless, we can learn valuable lessons from David. First, overseers among God’s people need to be especially careful to exercise self-control so that they do not abuse their authority. Second, no one can be complacent, thinking that he is safe from temptation.​—1 Cor. 10:12. w17.09 5-6 ¶12-13

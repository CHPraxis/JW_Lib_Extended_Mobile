<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">AS THE last days near their end, the wicked continue to “sprout like weeds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:7-19:92:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 92:7</a>) It comes as no surprise, therefore, that moral standards are being abandoned. In this environment, how can we “be young children as to badness” yet “full-grown in [our] understanding”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:20-46:14:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The answer is found in our theme text, which says in part: “Those who seek Jehovah can understand everything”​—that is, everything necessary to please him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:5-20:28:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 28:5</a>) A similar thought is expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:9-20:2:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9</a>, which says that Jehovah “treasures up practical wisdom for the upright.” As a result, the upright are able to “understand what is righteous and just and fair, the entire course of what is good.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Noah, Daniel, and Job acquired that wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 14:14</a>) The same is true of God’s people today. What about you personally? Do you “understand everything” necessary to please Jehovah? The key is to have accurate knowledge of <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>him.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did Noah come to know Jehovah, and how did accurate knowledge help him?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>How Noah came to know Jehovah. </em>Since early in human history, men and women of faith have learned about God in three primary ways: by observing the visible creation, from other God-fearing humans, and by experiencing the blessings of living in harmony with God’s righteous standards and principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:18-23:48:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 48:18</a>) By observing the physical creation, Noah would have seen abundant evidence not only of God’s existence but also of his many invisible qualities, such as “his eternal power and Godship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) As a result, Noah did more than believe in God; he developed strong faith in him.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Noah become familiar with God’s purpose for mankind?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Faith “follows the thing heard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 10:17</a>) How did Noah hear about Jehovah? He no doubt learned much from his relatives. These included his father, Lamech, who was a man of faith and whose life overlapped Adam’s. (See opening picture.) They also included his grandfather Methuselah and his great-great-grandfather Jared, whose life overlapped Noah’s by 366 years.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:36-42:3:37" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 3:36, 37</a>) Perhaps from these men and possibly from their wives, Noah learned about mankind’s start, God’s purpose that a righteous human family fill the earth, and the rebellion in Eden​—the results of which Noah could see for himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:16-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 24</a>) In any event, what Noah learned touched his heart, moving him to serve God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>How did hope reinforce Noah’s faith?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Faith is reinforced by hope. Imagine, then, how Noah must have felt when he learned that his name, which probably means “Rest; Consolation,” embodied hope! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:29-1:5:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 5:29</a>, ftn.) Under inspiration, Lamech said: “This one [Noah] will bring us comfort from . . . the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.” Noah had hope in God. Like Abel and Enoch before him, he believed in the “offspring” who would bruise the serpent’s head.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>While Noah may not have grasped the details of the prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, he no doubt saw in it the hope of deliverance. Moreover, that Edenic promise harmonized with the message proclaimed by Enoch, who also foretold God’s judgment of the wicked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) Enoch’s message, which will have its final fulfillment at Armageddon, surely reinforced Noah’s faith and hope!</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>In what ways did accurate knowledge of God protect Noah?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>How accurate knowledge of God benefited Noah. </em>Accurate knowledge gave Noah faith and godly wisdom, which protected him from harm, especially spiritual harm. For instance, because Noah “walked with the true God,” he did not walk, or associate, with the ungodly. He was not fooled by the materialized <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>demons, who surely impressed faithless, gullible humans with their superhuman abilities​—perhaps even to the point of becoming objects of idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Also, Noah knew that <em>humans </em>were told to reproduce and fill the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28</a>) Hence, he must have known that sexual unions between women and materialized spirits were both unnatural and wrong. That conclusion was no doubt confirmed when those unions produced abnormal offspring. In time, God warned Noah that He was going to bring a flood upon the earth. Noah’s faith in that warning moved him to build the ark, thus saving his household.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 11:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>How we cultivate faith like Noah’s. </em>The key is to be good students of God’s Word, to take to heart what we learn, and to let that knowledge mold us and guide us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:13-15</a>) Then faith and godly wisdom will protect us from Satan’s clever designs and from the world’s evil spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:11</a>) That spirit fosters a love for violence and immorality. And it impels people to focus on fleshly desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 2:15, 16</a>) It may even move the spiritually weak to ignore the evidence of the closeness of God’s great day. Note that when Jesus compared our time with Noah’s, he focused, not on violence or immorality, but on the dangers of spiritual apathy.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:39" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:36-39</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Ask yourself: ‘Does my way of life indicate that I truly know Jehovah?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>How Daniel came to know Jehovah. </em>Daniel was evidently well-instructed by his parents, who taught him to love Jehovah and his written Word.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:1-27:9:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Dan. 9:1, 2</a>) Daniel’s intimate knowledge of God, including God’s dealings with Israel, is beautifully reflected in the prophet’s heartfelt and contrite prayer recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:3-27:9:19" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Daniel 9:3-19</a>.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>12-14. </strong>(a) In what ways did Daniel show godly wisdom? (b) How was Daniel blessed for his courageous loyalty to God?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>How accurate knowledge of God benefited Daniel. </em>For a faithful Jew, life in pagan Babylon presented big challenges.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 34:14</a>) What enabled Daniel to balance the two requirements? Godly wisdom helped him to grasp the principle of relative subjection to secular authorities. Centuries later, Jesus taught the very same principle.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:25-42:20:25" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 20:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Consider what Daniel did when an official decree forbade prayer to any god or man other than the king for 30 days. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:7-27:6:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 6:7-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Daniel could have made excuses, saying, ‘Thirty days is not forever!’ But he refused to let a royal edict override his Scriptural obligations. Of course, he could have <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>prayed discreetly so as not to be observed. He knew that his daily custom was well-known.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah blessed Daniel’s conscientious and courageous decision by miraculously sparing him a cruel death.

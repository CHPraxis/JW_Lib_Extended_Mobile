<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What challenges did Noah face, and why was his endurance remarkable?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Challenges that Noah faced. </em>By the time of Noah’s great-grandfather Enoch, people had become very ungodly. They were even saying “shocking things” against Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) Violence was increasing. In fact, in Noah’s day, “the earth was filled with violence.” Wicked angels materialized as humans, took wives, and produced brutal, hybrid offspring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:2-1:6:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 6:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) But Noah stood out as different. “Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah. . . . He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:8-1:6:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 6:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Consider what those words say about that righteous man. For one thing, Noah did not walk with God in that wicked pre-Flood world for a mere 70 or 80 years​—the life span of many today. He lived in that world for almost 600 years! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 7:11</a>) And unlike us today, he did not have a congregation of fellow worshippers​—evidently not even his siblings—​to turn to for spiritual support.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>In what ways did Noah show great courage?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Noah was not content just to lead a good life. He also became a bold “preacher of righteousness,” publicly confessing his faith in Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:5</a>) “Through this faith he condemned the world,” wrote the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 11:7</a>) It stands to reason, therefore, that Noah faced ridicule and opposition, perhaps even threats of violence. But he was not “trembling at men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>) Rather, he had the courage that Jehovah gives to his faithful servants.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>When building the ark, what challenges did Noah face?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>After Noah had walked with God for more than five centuries, Jehovah told him to build an ark for the saving of human and animal life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:32-1:5:32" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6:14</a>) How difficult that project must have seemed​—and not just from the construction point of view! Noah surely knew that it would bring on even more ridicule and opposition. Still, he obediently went ahead in faith. “He did just so.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:22-1:6:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 6:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>In what ways did Noah trust in Jehovah as his Provider?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Another challenge for Noah was that of providing materially for his wife and children. Before the Flood, people had to work extra hard to grow food, and Noah was surely no exception. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:28-1:5:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 5:28, 29</a>) Even so, he centered his life, not <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>on material concerns, but on God. Even when building the ark, which may have taken as long as 40 or 50 years, Noah kept his spiritual focus. And he continued to do so for another 350 years after the Flood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:28-1:9:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 9:28</a>) What a fine example of faith and obedience!</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) How can we imitate Noah’s faith and obedience? (b) How does God view all who uphold his standards?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>How we can imitate Noah’s faith and obedience. </em>We do so by upholding God’s righteousness, by being no part of Satan’s world, and by keeping Kingdom interests in first place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> John 15:19</a>) To be sure, our way of life does not win us the world’s approval. Indeed, even now, our firm stand for God’s laws, such as those concerning marriage and sexual morality, has led to negative publicity in some lands. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:17-39:3:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Malachi 3:17, 18</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Like Noah, however, we fear Jehovah, not men. We know that he alone gives everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:4-42:12:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 12:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>But what about you personally? Will you keep ‘walking with God,’ even when others mock or criticize you or when economic pressures test your faith in your Provider? If you imitate the faith and obedience of Noah, you can be confident that Jehovah will care for you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What big challenges did Daniel and his three companions face in Babylon? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>Challenges that Daniel faced. </em>Daniel lived as a captive in Babylon, a city filled with idolatry and spiritism. Moreover, the Babylonians looked down on the Jews, mocking both them and their God, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 137:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:3-19:137:3" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 3</a>) How this must have hurt faithful Jews like Daniel! Also, he and his three companions​—Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah—​were in the spotlight, as it were, because they were to be trained in the king’s service. Even their diet was set for them. In fact, food and drink soon became an issue because Daniel did not want to “defile himself with the king’s delicacies.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:5-27:1:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 1:5-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:14-27:1:17" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 14-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>(a) What fine qualities did Daniel display? (b) How did Jehovah view Daniel?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>A more subtle challenge for Daniel could have involved his exceptional abilities, which led to his receiving special privileges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:19-27:1:20" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Dan. 1:19, 20</a>) But instead of becoming arrogant and opinionated, he remained humble and modest, always giving due credit to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:30-27:2:30" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Dan. 2:30</a>) In fact, it was while Daniel was still a young man that Jehovah counted him worthy of being mentioned as an example of righteousness, along with Noah and Job. Was God’s confidence in Daniel misplaced? Not at all! Daniel stayed faithful and obedient to the very end of his life. Indeed, he was likely in his late 90’s when God’s angel warmly said to him: “O Daniel, you very precious man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:11-27:10:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Dan. 10:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How may Daniel have been a blessing to his fellow Jews?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As a result of divine favor, Daniel was made a high official under both Babylonian and Medo-Persian rule.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>16, 17. </strong>What contrasting challenges did Job experience?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>Challenges that Job faced. </em>The life of Job is a study in contrasts. Before his trial, he was “the greatest of all the people of the East.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:3-18:1:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 1:3</a>) He was wealthy, well-known, and highly respected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:7-18:29:16" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Job 29:7-16</a>) Yet, despite all of this, Job did not develop a lofty view of himself or feel that he did not need God. In fact, Jehovah called him “my servant,” adding: “He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>In a very short space of time, Job’s life changed dramatically. He was driven to the depths of poverty and despair. The cause, we know, was the slanderer Satan, who lyingly accused Job of worshipping God out of self-interest. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b"><strong>Job 1:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah did not sweep aside that <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>wicked accusation. Instead, he gave Job the opportunity to prove his integrity, to show that his worship stemmed from a pure, unselfish heart.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>(a) What impresses you about Job’s integrity? (b) What do Jehovah’s dealings with Job reveal about Him?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Satan launched a series of vicious attacks against Job, leading Job to assume that God was to blame. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:13-18:1:21" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 1:13-21</a>) Then three false comforters arrived and attacked Job with cruel words, basically saying that God was giving him what he deserved! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:1-18:22:1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 22:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:5-18:22:10" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 5-10</a>) Yet, Job maintained his integrity. Yes, he spoke rashly at times, but Jehovah understood the pain Job felt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:1-18:6:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Job 6:1-3</a>) God saw a deeply depressed man who never turned his back on Him, even though Satan, in effect, threw Job to the ground and then verbally kicked him with lying insults. When the trial was over, Jehovah gave Job double what he had before the trial began, as well as an added 140 years of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>) During that time, he continued to give Jehovah exclusive devotion. How can we be sure?

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>19, 20. </strong>(a) How can we imitate Job’s faith and obedience? (b) In our dealings with others, how can we reflect God’s compassion?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:11</a>) Thanks in part to the book of Job, we know why God permits suffering.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Job’s experience also highlights our need to show compassion to fellow Christians who may be enduring hardships.

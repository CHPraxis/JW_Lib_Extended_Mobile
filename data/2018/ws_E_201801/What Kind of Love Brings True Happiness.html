<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>Why is the time that we live in different from any other time?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">WE LIVE in a time that is very different from any other time in human history. Jehovah is gathering a great crowd “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,” just as the Bible foretold. They are “a mighty nation” of more than eight million happy people who “are rendering [God] sacred service day and night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isaiah 60:22</a>) There have never before been so many people who have come to love God and their fellow humans.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What misdirected kind of love do we see in people who are not God’s friends? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>However, the Bible also foretold that in our day, people who are not friends of God would have a misdirected kind of love that is selfish. The apostle Paul wrote that in the last days, people would be <strong>“lovers of themselves, lovers of money,” </strong>and <strong>“lovers of pleasures </strong>rather than lovers of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-4</a>) This self-centered kind <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>of love is the opposite of love for God. Pursuing selfish goals does not make a person happy, although he may think that it will. Instead, it creates a selfish world and makes life difficult for everyone.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What will we examine in this article? Why?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul knew that selfish love would become very common and would be dangerous for Christians. So he warned them to “turn away” from, or to avoid, those who show selfish love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:5</a>) But we cannot avoid all contact with such people. So, what can we do to protect ourselves from the attitudes of people around us and please Jehovah, the God of love? Let us see the difference between the love that God wants us to have and the love described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:2-4</a>. Then we can look at ourselves and see how we can show the kind of love that will make us truly satisfied and happy.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Paul wrote: <strong>“Men will be lovers of themselves.” </strong>Does this mean that it is wrong to love ourselves? No, loving ourselves is normal and necessary. Jehovah designed us that way. Jesus said: “You must love your neighbor <strong>as yourself.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:31-41:12:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 12:31</a>) In fact, we cannot love other people if we do not love ourselves. The Bible also tells us: “Husbands should love their wives <strong>as their own bodies. </strong>A man who loves his wife loves <strong>himself, </strong>for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:28, 29</a>) So it is clear that we should have some love for ourselves.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The love of self that we read about at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:2</a> is not a normal or healthy love. It is selfish. If someone loves himself too much, he thinks more of himself than he needs to. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 12:3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He cares more about himself than about anyone else. When things go wrong, he blames others instead of himself. One Bible commentary compares such a person to a hedgehog that rolls itself up in a ball, staying warm with its soft fur but showing others only its sharp spines. Such people are not really happy.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Some Bible scholars believe that Paul mentioned love of self first because it produces the bad qualities he mentioned next. In contrast, the kind of love God wants us to have produces good qualities. It is related to joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, and self-control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) The psalmist wrote: <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>“Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:144:15-19:144:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 144:15</a>) Jehovah is a happy God, and his people are happy too. Also, in contrast with those who love themselves too much and think only of what they can receive, Jehovah’s servants are happy because they give to others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>How can we know if our love of self is becoming stronger than our love for God? Think about this wise advice: “Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you, as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3, 4</a>) We may ask ourselves: ‘Do I listen to this advice? Am I trying to do what God wants me to do? Do I look for ways to help others in the congregation and in the field ministry?’ It is not always easy to give our time and energy. It may mean that we have to work hard and sacrifice some things that we enjoy. But nothing could make us happier than knowing that the Sovereign of the universe is pleased with us!</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What have some Christians done because they love God?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Because they love God and want to serve him more fully, some Christians have given up careers that could have made them very rich. Ericka, who is a doctor, chose to pioneer rather than to focus on her medical career. She and her husband have been able to serve in several countries. She says: “The many <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>experiences we have had in helping out in a foreign-language field, along with the friendships we have made, have truly enriched our lives.” Ericka still works as a doctor, but she uses most of her time and energy to teach people about Jehovah and to help her brothers and sisters. She says that this brings her “heartfelt joy and inner satisfaction.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Paul wrote that people would be <strong>“lovers of money.” </strong>Some years ago, a pioneer in Ireland spoke to a man about God. The man opened his wallet, held up some paper money, and said: “This is my god!” Although they might not admit it, many people feel this way. They love money and the things it can buy. But the Bible warns: “A lover of silver will never be satisfied with silver, nor a lover of wealth with income.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>) A person who loves money never feels he has enough. He always wants more and spends his life trying to get it. This brings him “many pains.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What does the Bible say about riches and poverty?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Of course, we all need money. It gives us some protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>) But can we be happy if we have just enough for our basic needs? Yes! <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:12-21:5:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 5:12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Agur son of Jakeh wrote: “Give me neither poverty nor riches. Just let me consume my portion of food.” It is easy to understand why this man did not want to be very poor. He said that he did not want to be tempted to steal, because stealing would bring dishonor to God. But why did he not want to be rich? He wrote: “So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say, ‘Who is Jehovah?’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:8-20:30:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:8, 9</a>) You probably know people who trust in riches instead of in God.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What did Jesus say about money?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>A person who loves money cannot please God. Jesus said: “No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” He also said: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 6:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Many of Jehovah’s servants are trying to live a simpler life. They find that doing so gives them more time to serve Jehovah and also makes them happier. Jack, who lives in the United States, sold his large home and business so that he could pioneer with his wife. He explains: “It was hard to give up our beautiful home and property in the country.” But for years he used to come home frustrated because of <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>problems at work. He says: “My wife, a regular pioneer, was always so happy. She would say, ‘I have the greatest boss ever!’ Now that I too am pioneering, we both work for the same Person, Jehovah.”</p>

Notice that the verse does not say people would love pleasures <strong>more </strong>than God. That would mean they do love God a little. But the verse says <strong>“rather </strong>than” God. One scholar wrote that this verse “definitely does not mean that they also love God to some extent. It means that they do not love God at all.” This is a serious warning to people who love pleasures. The Bible describes lovers of pleasures as those who are “carried away by” pleasures of life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:14-42:8:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 8:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">MANY doctors and nurses work around people who have contagious diseases. They take care of their patients because they want to help them. But they also need to protect themselves so that they do not get infected with the disease they are trying to cure. As Jehovah’s servants, we are in a somewhat similar situation. Many of us live and work with people who are infected with attitudes and qualities that are completely different from God’s qualities. This can be difficult for us.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the last days of this system, people who do not love God ignore his standards of right and wrong. The apostle Paul described their negative qualities when he wrote his letter to Timothy. Paul said that these negative qualities would become even more common as we near the end of this system. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 3:1-5,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong>13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even though we may find these bad qualities shocking, we could still be influenced by the way people around us think, talk, and <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>act. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) In this article, we will see how different these qualities are from the qualities of God’s people. We will also see what we can do to protect ourselves from being infected with bad qualities while we help people come to know Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Paul wrote that in the last days, there would be “critical times hard to deal with.” Then he made a list of 19 negative qualities that would be very common in our time. These qualities are similar to the ones Paul mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:29-45:1:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 1:29-31</a>, but the list in his letter to Timothy uses words we do not find anywhere else in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Paul began with the words “for men will be.” Here, “men” means “people,” since both men and women can have bad qualities. But not <strong>all </strong>humans have the negative qualities that Paul described. Christians have very different qualities.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:18-39:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Malachi 3:18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What do you think it means to be puffed up with pride?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>After Paul said that many would be lovers of themselves and lovers of money, he added that people would be <strong>boastful, haughty, </strong>and <strong>puffed up with pride. </strong>People who have these qualities often think that they are better than others because of how they look, what they can do, what they have, or what their position in life is. Such people want more than anything to be admired. One scholar wrote about a person like that: “In his heart there is a little altar where he bows down before himself.” Some have said that pride is so ugly that even proud people do not like it when they see pride in others.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How have even faithful servants of Jehovah become proud?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah hates pride, which is described in the Bible as “haughty eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16, 17</a>) In fact, pride keeps a person far from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:4-19:10:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 10:4</a>) Pride is a quality of the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:6-54:3:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:6</a>) The sad truth is that even some loyal servants of Jehovah have become infected with pride. For example, King Uzziah of Judah was faithful for many years. But the Bible says: “As soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty to his own ruin, and he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God.” Uzziah went to the temple and burned incense, which was not his right to do. Later, faithful King Hezekiah also became proud, though only for a while.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:25-14:32:26" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 32:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What could have caused David to become proud? But why did he remain humble?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Some people become proud because they are good-looking, popular, musically talented, strong, or admired by others. David was all these things, but he remained humble his whole life. For example, after David killed Goliath, King Saul said that David could marry his daughter. But David said: “Who am I and who are my relatives, my father’s family in Israel, for me to become son-in-law to the king?” <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:18-9:18:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:18</a>) What helped David to remain humble? He knew that any qualities, abilities, and privileges he had were because God was humble and paid attention to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:5-19:113:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 113:5-8</a>) David realized that anything good he had came from Jehovah.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:7-46:4:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Like David, Jehovah’s people today try to be humble. It touches our hearts to know that Jehovah himself, who is the Most High, is humble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:35-19:18:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 18:35</a>) We want to apply these words: “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12</a>) We also know that love “does not brag, does not get puffed up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>) When others see that we are humble, they too may want to get to know Jehovah.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) How do some people today view disobedience to parents? (b) What does the Bible tell children to do?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Paul described how people would treat one another in the last days. He wrote that children would be <strong>disobedient to parents. </strong>Today, many books, movies, and television programs make it seem normal and acceptable for children to be disobedient to their parents. But the truth is that disobedience weakens the family, the basic unit of society. Humans have known this truth for a long time. For example, in ancient Greece, a man who hit his parents would lose his rights in the community. Under Roman law, someone who hit his father could be punished the way a murderer would be. Both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures command children to honor their parents.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Exodus 20:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What will help children to obey their parents?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What can help children to obey their parents even if those around them are not obedient? When children think about all the good things their parents have done for them, they should feel grateful and want to obey them. Young ones also need to understand that God, the Father of us all, expects them to obey their parents. As young people say good things about their parents, they help their friends to respect their own parents more. Of course, if parents <strong>have no natural affection </strong>for their children, it might be more difficult for their children to obey them. But when a young person feels that his parents really love him, it can help him to obey them even when <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>it is difficult. A young brother named Austin says: “Though I often felt inclined to try to get away with things, my parents set reasonable guidelines, explained the reasons for rules, and kept the lines of communication wide open. This helped me to be obedient. I could see that they cared for me, and that made me want to please them.”</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) What bad qualities show that people do not have love for one another? (b) How much do true Christians love other people?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Paul also described other qualities that show that people do not have love for one another. After “disobedient to parents,” he mentioned <strong>unthankful. </strong>This makes sense, because unthankful people do not value the good things that others do for them. Paul also said that people would be <strong>disloyal. </strong>They would <strong>not be open to any agreement, </strong>which means that they would not want to make peace with others. They would be <strong>blasphemers </strong>and <strong>betrayers, </strong>saying cruel and harmful things about people and even about God. And they would be <strong>slanderers, </strong>those who tell harmful lies to ruin the reputation of others.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—See footnote.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s servants are very different from most people in the world because they show genuine love for others. This has always been true. In fact, Jesus said that the only command in the Law of Moses that was more important than the command to love other people was the command to love God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:38-40:22:39" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 22:38, 39</a>) Jesus also said that true Christians would be known for the love they show for one another. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>John 13:34, 35</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>True Christians would love even their enemies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:43-40:5:44" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 5:43, 44</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How did Jesus show love for others?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jesus showed that he truly loved people. He did this by traveling from one city to another to tell people the good news about God’s Kingdom. He cured the blind, the lame, the lepers, and the deaf. He also brought those who had died back to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:22-42:7:22" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 7:22</a>) Jesus even gave his life to save humans, although many hated him. Jesus perfectly imitated his Father’s love. All over the world, Jehovah’s Witnesses imitate Jesus and show love for others.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How can the love we show for others help them want to know Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When we show people that we love them, it can make them want to get to know our heavenly Father. For example, a man in Thailand went to a regional convention and was impressed when he saw how the brothers and sisters showed love to one another. After he got home, he asked to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses twice a week. Then he preached to all his relatives. Only six months later, this man gave his first Bible reading at the Kingdom Hall. Are we showing love for others? Ask yourself: ‘Am I doing all I can to help people in my family, in my congregation, and in my ministry? Do I try to view others as Jehovah does?’</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>In the last days, people also show other bad qualities that we should avoid. For example, many are <strong>without love of goodness. </strong>They hate what is good and even oppose it. Such people are <strong>without self-control, fierce. </strong>Some are <strong>headstrong. </strong>They do things without thinking and do not care about the effect that their actions will have on others.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Many who used to behave like fierce animals have changed their personality. This dramatic change was foretold in a Bible prophecy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 11:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We read there about wild animals, such as wolves and lions, who live in peace with domestic animals, such as lambs and calves. Why would they have peace? The prophecy continues: “Because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>) Animals cannot learn about Jehovah, so in a symbolic way, this prophecy refers to changes that people make in their personalities.</p>

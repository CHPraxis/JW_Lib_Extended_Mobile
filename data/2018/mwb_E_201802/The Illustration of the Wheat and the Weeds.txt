TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 12-13
The Illustration of the Wheat and the Weeds




Jesus used the wheat and the weeds to illustrate how and when he would take out of mankind the entire wheat class of anointed Christians, beginning in 33 C.E.





13:24
‘A man sowed fine seed in his field’
  Sower: Jesus Christ

  Fine seed is sown: Jesus’ disciples are anointed with holy spirit

  The field: The world of mankind


13:25
“While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds”
  Enemy: The Devil

  Men were sleeping: Death of the apostles


13:30
“Let both grow together until the harvest”
  Wheat: Anointed Christians

  Weeds: Imitation Christians


“First collect the weeds . . . ; then gather the wheat”
  Slaves/​reapers: Angels

  Weeds collected: Imitation Christians are separated from anointed Christians

  Gathering into the storehouse: Anointed Christians are gathered into the restored congregation


When the harvest season began, what set true Christians apart from imitation ones?
How do I personally benefit from understanding this illustration?
DID YOU KNOW?





The weeds referred to in this illustration are generally believed to be bearded darnel, a poisonous plant that closely resembles wheat when the wheat is in its early stages of development. As the wheat and the weeds grow together, their roots become intertwined, making it impossible to remove the weeds without losing the wheat. Once the bearded darnel reaches maturity, it can easily be distinguished and removed.

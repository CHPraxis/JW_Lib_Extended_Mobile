TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 16-17
Whose Thoughts Are You Thinking?




16:21-23





  Although Peter no doubt spoke with good motive, Jesus quickly corrected Peter’s wrong thinking

  Jesus knew that this was no time to “be kind” to himself. Relaxing his guard at such a critical time was precisely what Satan wanted him to do


16:24
Jesus identified three things we must do to allow God’s will to guide us. What does each involve?
  Disown yourself

  Pick up your torture stake

  Keep following Jesus

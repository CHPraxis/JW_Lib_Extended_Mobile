TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 18-19
Carefully Avoid Stumbling Yourself and Others




Jesus used illustrations to teach the seriousness of being stumbled or of causing others to stumble.
18:6, 7
  A “stumbling block” refers to an action or circumstance that leads a person to follow an improper course, to stumble or fall morally, or to fall into sin

  A person who causes someone to stumble would be better off if he fell into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck







Millstones




18:8, 9
  Jesus counseled his followers to remove even something as precious as a hand or an eye if it causes them to stumble

  It would be better to give up such a cherished thing and enter into God’s Kingdom than to hold on to it and end up in Gehenna, a symbol of permanent destruction


What in my life could become a stumbling block, and how can I keep from stumbling myself or others?

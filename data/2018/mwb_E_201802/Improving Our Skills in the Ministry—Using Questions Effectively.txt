LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Using Questions Effectively




WHY IMPORTANT: If “the thoughts of a man’s heart are like deep waters,” then questions are like a bucket to draw them out. (Pr 20:5) Questions help us to involve our listeners. Answers to well-chosen questions often provide valuable feedback. Jesus used questions effectively. How can we imitate him?





HOW TO DO IT:
  Ask viewpoint questions. Jesus asked a series of questions to determine his disciples’ point of view. (Mt 16:13-16; be 238 ¶3-5) What viewpoint questions might you ask?

  Ask leading questions. To correct Peter’s thinking, Jesus asked questions and provided possible answers that led Peter to the right conclusion. (Mt 17:24-26) What leading questions might you ask to help someone reach the right conclusion?

  Commend your listener. After a scribe “answered intelligently,” Jesus commended him. (Mr 12:34) How might you commend someone who gives an answer to a question?


Be respectful. We do not have the authority that Jesus had. So we must show respect especially to older ones, people we do not know, and those in positions of authority.​—1Pe 2:17.

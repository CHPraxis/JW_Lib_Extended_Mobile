TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MATTHEW 14-15
Feeding Many Through the Hands of a Few




Just before the Passover of 32 C.E., Jesus performed a miracle, the only one that was recorded by all four Gospel writers.
By means of this miracle, Jesus set a pattern that he continues to follow in our day.
14:16-21
  Jesus instructed his disciples to feed the crowds, even though they had only five loaves and two fish

  Jesus took the loaves and fish and, after praying, began to distribute them to the disciples who, in turn, distributed them to the crowds

  Miraculously, there was more than enough for everyone to eat. Jesus fed thousands through the hands of just a few​—his disciples






  Jesus foretold that during the last days, he would appoint a channel to provide spiritual “food at the proper time.”​—Mt 24:45

  In 1919, Jesus appointed “the faithful and discreet slave,” a small group of anointed brothers, over “his domestics,” those who are fed

  By means of this small group of anointed brothers, Jesus is following the pattern he set in the first century


How can I show that I recognize and respect the channel that Jesus is using to feed people spiritually?

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Jesus walked the earth, he emphasized the command: “Honor your father and your mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 20:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:4-40:15:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mt 15:4</a>) Jesus certainly had freeness of speech because he “remained obedient” to his parents as a youth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:51-42:2:51" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 2:51</a>, ftn.) As an adult, he made sure that his mother would be cared for after his death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:26-43:19:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 19:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In our day, too, Christian youths who obey their parents and speak to them respectfully show them honor. In fact, the command to honor our parents has no time limit. Even after our parents have grown old, we should continue to honor them by benefiting from their wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:22-20:23:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 23:22</a>) We also honor our aged parents by caring for them emotionally and financially as needed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ti 5:8</a>) Whether we are young or old, maintaining good communication with our parents is a key to honoring them.</p>

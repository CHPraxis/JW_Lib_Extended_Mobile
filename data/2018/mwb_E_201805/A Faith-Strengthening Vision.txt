TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | MARK 9-10
A Faith-Strengthening Vision




9:1-7





Imagine how Jesus must have felt when he heard his heavenly Father announce during the transfiguration vision that He approved of him. This no doubt fortified Jesus for the suffering he was going to undergo. This vision also made a powerful impression on Peter, James, and John. Jesus was indeed the Messiah, and they were right to listen to him. Some 32 years later, Peter still recalled the experience and how it made “the prophetic word” more sure for him.​—2Pe 1:16-19.
Although we did not personally see this impressive vision, we are witnessing its fulfillment. Jesus is ruling as a powerful King. Soon, he will “complete his conquest,” opening the way for a righteous new world.​—Re 6:2.
How has your faith been strengthened by seeing the fulfillment of Bible prophecy?

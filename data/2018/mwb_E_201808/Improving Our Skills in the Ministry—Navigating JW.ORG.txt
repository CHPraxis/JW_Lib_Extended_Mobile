LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Navigating JW.ORG




WHY IMPORTANT: Every publication in our Teaching Toolbox refers to jw.org. In fact, the main purpose of the contact card and the tract Where Can We Find Answers to Life’s Big Questions? is to direct people to our website. You can place a publication from our Teaching Toolbox with someone by using jw.org to e-mail an electronic copy or share a link. This can be especially helpful when witnessing to someone who speaks another language. Additionally, people may ask questions that are answered by publications not found in our Teaching Toolbox. If we can navigate the website, we can be more effective in our ministry.
HOW TO DO IT:





  Use the “BIBLE TEACHINGS” tab. Suppose that you are witnessing to a parent who would like more information about child-rearing. Go to BIBLE TEACHINGS > MARRIAGE & FAMILY.

  Use the “PUBLICATIONS” tab. Suppose that you are witnessing informally at school and you want to share with a classmate the brochure Answers to 10 Questions Young People Ask. Go to PUBLICATIONS > BOOKS & BROCHURES.

  Use the “ABOUT US” tab. Suppose that you are witnessing to a coworker who would like to read a brief explanation of our beliefs. Go to ABOUT US > FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.


WATCH THE VIDEO NAVIGATING JW.ORG, AND THEN CONSIDER WHERE YOU WOULD GO ON THE WEBSITE TO HELP:
  an atheist

  someone who has just suffered a tragedy

  an inactive brother or sister

  a return visit who wonders how our work is financed

  a person from another country who wants to attend a meeting in his homeland

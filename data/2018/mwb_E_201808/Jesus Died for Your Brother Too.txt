LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Jesus Died for Your Brother Too




Jesus sacrificed his life for imperfect people. (Ro 5:8) No doubt we personally appreciate that Jesus showed his love for us by giving his life in our behalf. Nevertheless, at times we may need to remind ourselves that Christ died for our brother too. How can we show Christlike love to our brothers and sisters, who just like us are imperfect? Consider three ways. First, we can expand our circle of friends to include those whose background is different from ours. (Ro 15:7; 2Co 6:12, 13) Second, we can be careful to avoid saying or doing things that may offend others. (Ro 14:13-15) Finally, if someone sins against us, we can be quick to forgive. (Lu 17:3, 4; 23:34) If we work hard to imitate Jesus in these ways, Jehovah will continue to bless the congregation with peace and unity.

19:12-24





What do the different features of the parable represent?
            The master pictures Jesus

            The slaves picture Jesus’ anointed disciples

             The money, which the master entrusts to the slaves, pictures the precious privilege of making disciples


This parable contains a warning about what would happen if Christ’s anointed disciples developed the characteristics of a wicked slave. Jesus expects his disciples to use their assets fully in making more disciples.
How can I imitate faithful anointed Christians in the work of making disciples?

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Remember the Wife of Lot




Why did Lot’s wife look back as she was fleeing Sodom? The Bible does not say. (Ge 19:17, 26) The context of Jesus’ warning indicates that she may have longed for the things she left behind. (Lu 17:31, 32) How can we avoid losing God’s favor as Lot’s wife did? We must not allow a quest for material comforts to become our priority. (Mt 6:33) Jesus taught that we “cannot slave for God and for Riches.” (Mt 6:24) But what if we detect that material things are starting to crowd out spiritual things in our life? We can pray to Jehovah for discernment to see where we need to make changes and for the courage and strength to do so.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">SOME inventions, such as the telephone, the light bulb, the car, and the refrigerator, have made life better. Other inventions, such as gunpowder, land mines, cigarettes, and the atomic bomb, have made life more dangerous. But there is something that is older than all of these and has hurt mankind the most. What is it? The lie! Telling a lie is saying something that we know is not true in order to deceive, or trick, someone. Who told the first lie? The Devil! Jesus Christ called him “the father of the lie.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>John 8:44</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When did he tell the first lie?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>He did so thousands of years ago in the garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were enjoying life in the beautiful Paradise that Jehovah had created for them. God had told them that if they ate from “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,” they would die. Even though Satan knew this, he used a snake to tell Eve: “You certainly will not die.” That was the very first lie. Satan also said: “God <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why was Satan’s lie malicious, and what happened because of that lie?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Satan’s lie was malicious because he knew that if Eve believed him and ate the fruit, she would die. And that is exactly what happened. Eve and later Adam disobeyed Jehovah’s command and eventually died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:5-1:5:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5:5</a>) More than that, because of Adam’s sin, “death spread to all men.” In fact, “death ruled as king . . . , even over those who had not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14</a>) That is why we are not perfect and do not live forever as God intended. Instead, we live only about “70 years, or 80 if one is especially strong,” and our lives are “filled with trouble and sorrow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>) All of this has happened because of Satan’s lie!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>(a) What questions must we be able to answer? (b) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1, 2</a>, who only can be Jehovah’s friend?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus said about Satan: “He did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him.” Satan has not changed. He is still “misleading the entire inhabited earth” with his lies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>) But we do not want Satan to mislead us. So we need to know the answers to three questions. How is Satan misleading people today? Why do people lie? And how can we speak the truth all the time so that we do not lose Jehovah’s friendship, as Adam and Eve did?​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 15:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We can avoid being deceived by Satan. The apostle Paul said: “We are not ignorant of his intentions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>; footnote) We know that Satan controls the whole world, including false religion, corrupt governments, and greedy businesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) So we are not surprised that Satan and his demons influence powerful people to “speak lies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:1, 2</a>) For example, some business people tell lies in their advertisements to sell products that are harmful or to trick people and take their money.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) Why is it especially bad when religious leaders tell lies? (b) What lies have you heard religious leaders tell?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>It is especially bad when religious leaders tell lies. Why? Because if someone believes their false teachings and does things that God hates, that person may lose the opportunity to live forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:9-28:4:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hosea 4:9</a>) Jesus knew that the religious leaders in his day were deceiving the people. He boldly told them: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you travel over sea and dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him a subject for Gehenna,” that is, everlasting destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:15-40:23:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 23:15</a>; footnote) Jesus said that those false religious leaders were just like <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>their father the Devil, who is “a murderer.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>There are many religious leaders in our day too. They may be called pastors, priests, rabbis, swamis, or by other titles. Like the Pharisees, they do not teach the truth from God’s Word but have “exchanged the truth of God for the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:18-45:1:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 1:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:25-45:1:25" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Some of their lies are “once saved, always saved,” humans have an immortal soul, the dead are reincarnated, and God accepts homosexual lifestyles and same-sex marriages.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What lie will political leaders soon tell, but how should we react to it?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Politicians too have used lies to deceive humans. One of the biggest lies they will soon tell is that they have brought “peace and security” to the world. But “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.” So we should not believe these political leaders who say that things are improving. The truth is that we “know very well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:1-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) Why do people lie, and what are the consequences? (b) What should we remember about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Today, powerful people are not the only ones who lie. The article “Why We Lie,” by Y. Bhattacharjee, says that “lying has come to be recognized as a deeply ingrained human trait.” In other words, people think that it is natural and normal to lie. People often lie to protect themselves, perhaps to hide mistakes they have made or crimes they have committed. They also lie to make money or to benefit themselves in some other way. The article also says that some people have no problem lying “to strangers, co-workers, friends, and loved ones.”</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">When people lie, they can deceive other humans, but they cannot deceive Jehovah</p>
</div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What is the result of all these lies? People no longer trust one another, and relationships are ruined. For example, imagine how devastated a faithful husband must be when he learns that his wife had an affair and then lied to him to hide what she did. Or imagine how terrible it is when a man mistreats his wife and children at home but pretends to be loving and caring to them when they are around others. Such people can deceive other humans, but we should remember that they cannot deceive Jehovah. The Bible says that “all things are naked and openly exposed” to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>In the Bible, there is an example of a Christian couple whom Satan <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>influenced to lie to God. Ananias and Sapphira tried to deceive the apostles. They sold some of their property and then gave only part of the money to the apostles. Ananias and Sapphira wanted to impress others in the congregation, so they told the apostles that they had given all of the money. But Jehovah knew they were lying, and he punished them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:1-44:5:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 5:1-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How does Jehovah feel about people who lie? All people who tell malicious lies and who do not repent will end up in “the lake of fire,” just like Satan. In other words, they will be destroyed forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 20:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 21:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:6-19:5:6" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Psalm 5:6</a>) Why?

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We know that Jehovah “is not a mere man who tells lies” and that “it is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:19-4:23:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Numbers 23:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:18-58:6:18" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:18</a>) “Jehovah hates . . . a lying tongue.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16, 17</a>) If we want to please him, we must tell the truth.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>If you are a young person, you may want your peers to accept you. Yet because of this desire, some young people are living a double life. They pretend to be morally clean when they are with their family and the congregation but are completely different when they are on social media or with people who do not serve Jehovah. They may use bad language, wear immodest clothes, listen to music with unclean lyrics, get drunk, use drugs, date secretly, or do other bad things. They are lying to their parents, to their brothers and sisters, and to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:4-19:26:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4, 5</a>) But Jehovah knows when we claim to honor him and then do things he hates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:6-41:7:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mark 7:6</a>) It is so much better to do what the proverb says: “Let your heart not envy sinners, but be in the fear of Jehovah all day long.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:17-20:23:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:17</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)</p>

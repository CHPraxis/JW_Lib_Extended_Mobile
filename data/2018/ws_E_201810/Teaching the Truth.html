<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JESUS CHRIST was a carpenter and later a minister. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:3-41:6:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:8-45:15:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 15:8</a>) He did both kinds of work perfectly. As a carpenter, he learned how to use his tools to make useful products out of wood. And as a minister, he used his deep knowledge of the Scriptures to help the common people understand the truth from God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 24:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 45</a>) When Jesus was 30 years old, he stopped being a carpenter and became a minister because he knew that this was the most important work he could do. He said that preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God was one reason why God sent him to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:43</a>) Jesus focused his life on preaching the good news, and he wanted others to do the same.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:35-40:9:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 9:35-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Most of us are not carpenters, but all of us are ministers who teach others the good news. This work is so important that God is involved. In fact, we are called “God’s fellow workers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:4-47:6:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>2 Corinthians 6:4</a>) We agree with the psalmist who said: “The very essence of your word is truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:159-19:119:160" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 119:159, 160</a>) Jehovah’s word is the truth. That is why we want to be sure that we are “handling the word of the truth aright” in our ministry. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 2:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>So we keep trying to become more skillful at using the Bible, our main tool for teaching others about Jehovah, Jesus, and the Kingdom. To help us to be successful in our ministry, Jehovah’s organization has given us other useful tools, and we need to know how to use them too. These tools are in our Teaching Toolbox.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What should we focus on in our ministry, and how does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a> help us to do that?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>You may wonder why we call it a Teaching Toolbox and not a Preaching Toolbox. That is because to “preach” means to declare a message, but to “teach” means to explain that message so that a person understands what he hears and then is moved to act on what he learns. During the short time left in this system, we must focus on starting Bible studies and teaching people the truth so that they may become disciples of Christ. This means that we should zealously look for all those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life” and help them to start serving Jehovah.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:44-44:13:48" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 13:44-48</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How can we find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>How can we find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life”? For the first Christians, the only way to find those people was to preach. Jesus told his disciples: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 10:11</a>) We need to do the same today. Of course, if people are not sincere, are proud, or do not really care about God, we do not expect them to listen to the good news. We are looking for people who are sincere, who are humble, and who really want to know the truth. We can compare our search for people to what Jesus had to do when he was a carpenter. Before he could make a piece of furniture, a door, a yoke, or something else, he first had to find the right wood. Then he could get his toolbox, use his skills, and make the item. In a similar way today, we first have to find sincere people, and then we can use our tools and skills to help them become disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What do we need to know about the tools in our Teaching Toolbox? Illustrate. (See opening pictures.)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In a toolbox, each tool has a specific purpose. For example, think about the tools Jesus used as a carpenter.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) He needed tools to measure, mark, cut, drill, and shape the wood, as well as tools to level the pieces and join them together. Similarly, each tool in our Teaching Toolbox has a specific purpose. So let us find out how to use these important tools.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Invitations. </strong>The printed invitation to our meetings says: “You are invited to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Then it says that you can do this “at our public meetings” “or with a personal instructor.” So the invitation tells people who we are and also invites those who are “conscious of their spiritual need” to study the Bible with us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) Of course, people are welcome to attend our meetings whether they accept a Bible study or not. When they come to our meetings, they will see how much they can learn about the Bible.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why is it important for people to come to at least one of our meetings? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It is important that we keep inviting people to attend our meetings at least once. Why? Because when they come, they will see that Jehovah’s Witnesses teach the truth from the Bible and help people get to know God, while false religions do not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:13</a>) For example, a married couple in the United States named Ray and Linda noticed this difference some years ago. They believed in God and wanted to get to know him better. So they decided to visit all the churches in their city and to look for two things before joining one. First, they would have to learn something at the church, and second, the church members must dress like people who claim to serve God. It took them several years because there were so many churches. But they were very disappointed. They had not learned anything, and the church members dressed very disrespectfully. After they visited the last church on their list, Linda went to work and Ray went home. On his way home, he drove by a Kingdom Hall. He thought, ‘Let me go in and see what happens there.’ Of course, this was the best experience of all! Everyone at the Kingdom Hall was kind and friendly and dressed very nicely. Ray sat in the front row and loved what he learned! This reminds us of the apostle Paul’s description of a person who comes into a meeting for the first time and says: “God is really among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:23-46:14:25" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:23-25</a>) Ray came to the meeting every Sunday after that. Then he started coming to every midweek meeting. Linda also started coming to the meetings, and although they were in their 70’s, they studied the Bible and got baptized.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup>Videos. </strong>In Jesus’ day, the only tools a carpenter had were hand tools. But now, carpenters also have tools that use electric power, such as saws, drills, and sanders. When we preach today, in addition to printed literature, we have beautiful videos to show people. Four of them are in our toolbox: <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018807&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><strong><em>Why Study the Bible?,</em></strong></a><a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014311&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"> <strong><em>What Happens at a Bible Study?,</em></strong></a><a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014315&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"> <strong><em>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong>and <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1102017423&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><strong><em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Who Are We?</em></strong></a> The shorter videos can be played in less than two minutes and work well on the initial call. The longer videos can be used on return visits and with those who have more time. These videos are wonderful tools because they can motivate people to study the Bible and come to our meetings.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>What effect can watching one of our videos in their own language have on people? Give examples.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>As an example, one sister met a woman who had moved from Micronesia and whose first language is Yapese. The sister showed her <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018807&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>Why Study the Bible?</em></a> in Yapese. When the video started, the woman said: “This is my language. I can’t believe it! I can tell from his accent that he is from my island. He speaks my language!” After that, she said that she was going to read and watch everything in her language on jw.org. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:8-44:2:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 2:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 11</a>.) Another example is that of a sister in the United States whose nephew lives on a different continent. She sent him a link to the same video in his language. He watched the video and e-mailed her: “The part about an evil power controlling the world particularly caught my attention. I signed up for a Bible study.” This is especially exciting because he lives in a country where our work is restricted!</p>

(See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:402018604/53-58">Teaching Toolbox</a>.”) Let us use these tools as best we can. Each one of us can decide which tool in the toolbox to use and when. But remember, our goal is not just to distribute literature, and we do not give literature to people who are not interested in our message. Our goal is to make disciples of people who are sincere, who are humble, and who really want to know God, people who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

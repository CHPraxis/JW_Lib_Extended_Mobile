<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Moses had led the Israelites for a very long time, but now Joshua would lead them. So he may have wondered if the people would accept him as their leader.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:9-6:1:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 1:9-11</a>) God blessed Joshua for trusting in him and used an angel to guide Joshua and the Israelites.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What unusual experience did Joshua have near Jericho? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Soon after the Israelites crossed the Jordan, Joshua had an unusual experience. Near the city of Jericho, he met a man with a sword. Joshua asked the man: “Are you on our side or on the side of our adversaries?” Joshua was surprised when the man said that he was the “chief of Jehovah’s army,” an angel who was ready to defend God’s people. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:13-6:5:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Joshua 5:13-15</strong></a> <strong>and footnote.) </strong>Although the account in other places says that Jehovah was speaking directly to Joshua, it seems that God was using an angel to speak for him, as he often did in the past.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:2-2:3:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 3:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:4:1-6:4:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Joshua 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:4:15-6:4:15" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:2-6:5:2" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 5:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:9-6:5:9" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:38-44:7:38" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> Acts 7:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="9-7" class="b"> Galatians 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>6-8. </strong>(a) Why might some of the angel’s instructions have seemed strange? (b) How do we know that the instructions were wise and came at the right time? (See also footnote.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The angel told Joshua exactly what he needed to do to conquer Jericho. At first, some of the instructions might have seemed strange. For example, the angel told Joshua to circumcise all the soldiers. This meant that they would not be able to fight for a few days. Was it really the best time to circumcise these men?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:24-1:34:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 34:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:2-6:5:2" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Joshua 5:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:8-6:5:8" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Maybe the soldiers wondered, ‘How will we protect our families if the enemy attacks our camp?’ But then something unexpected happened! Instead of attacking the Israelites, the men of Jericho became afraid of them. We read: “Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites; no one was leaving and no one was entering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:1-6:6:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joshua 6:1</a>) This news must have made the Israelites trust in God’s direction even more!</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The angel told Joshua that the Israelites should not attack Jericho. Instead, they had to march around the city once a day for six days and then seven times on the seventh day. The soldiers might have thought, ‘What a waste of time and energy!’ But Israel’s invisible Leader knew exactly what he was doing! Following his instructions <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>only made the Israelites’ faith stronger, and they did not have to fight against the soldiers of Jericho.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:2-6:6:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Joshua 6:2-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:30-58:11:30" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:30</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why should we follow any instructions we receive from God’s organization? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What can we learn from this account? Jehovah’s organization sometimes does things in a new way, and we may not always understand why. For example, we may not always have thought it was a good idea to use electronic devices for personal study, in the ministry, or at meetings. But now we probably see the benefits of using them if possible. When we see the positive results of such changes, our faith grows stronger and we become more united with our brothers and sisters.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>About 13 years after an uncircumcised Gentile named Cornelius became a Christian, some Jewish Christians were still saying that circumcision was necessary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 15:1, 2</a>) In the city of Antioch, brothers were arguing about this. So the elders arranged for Paul to go and ask the governing body in Jerusalem about it. But who was really arranging <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>for him to go? Paul explained: “I went up as a result of a revelation.” Clearly, it was Christ who directed matters so that the question would be answered by the governing body.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:1-48:2:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Galatians 2:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Christ directed the governing body to make it clear that non-Jewish Christians did not need to be circumcised. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:19-44:15:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 15:19, 20</a>) Still, years later, many Jewish Christians continued to circumcise their sons. Then the elders in Jerusalem heard the rumor that Paul did not respect the Law of Moses. So the elders asked Paul to do something that would show his respect for the Law.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:20-44:21:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 21:20-26</a>) They told him to take four men to the temple so that people would see that Paul did respect the Law. Paul could have said: ‘This makes no sense! Why would you ask me to do this? The Jewish Christians who do not understand the question of circumcision are the ones with the problem.’ But Paul understood that the elders wanted all Christians to be united, so he humbly followed their instructions. Yet, we may wonder why Jesus allowed circumcision to continue to be a problem for such a long time, even though the Law of Moses had ended when Jesus died.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:13-51:2:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Colossians 2:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>Why, possibly, did Christ allow time to pass before he completely settled the question of circumcision?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>It can take time to adjust to a new understanding. Some Jewish Christians needed time to accept the fact that they were no longer under the Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>) They were used to thinking that circumcision was a sign of a special relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:9-1:17:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 17:9-12</a>) Others were afraid that they would be persecuted in their Jewish communities for being different. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:12-48:6:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Galatians 6:12</a>) But in time, Christ gave them more direction in letters from Paul.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 2:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:23-48:3:25" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:23-25</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Christ is still the Leader of the Christian congregation today. So if the organization makes a change that you do not understand, think about the way Christ led God’s people in the past. Whether in Joshua’s day or in the <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>time of the apostles, Christ has always given wise direction to protect God’s people, make their faith stronger, and help them stay united.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:8-58:13:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Today, “the faithful and discreet slave” gives us the direction we need just when we need it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) This direction proves that Jesus cares for us. Marc, who has four children, says: “Satan is trying to weaken congregations by attacking families. Now with the encouragement to conduct family worship each week, the message is clear for family heads​—safeguard your family!”</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>When we see how Christ is leading us, we will understand that he wants to help us keep our faith strong. For example, an elder named Patrick says: “At first, some found it discouraging to meet in small groups for field service on weekends.” But he says that this change shows how Jesus cares for everyone in the congregation. For example, some brothers and sisters who are shy or who did not go out in the field ministry very much feel more needed and useful. This has strengthened their faith.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Christ also helps us to stay focused on our preaching work, which is the most important work being done on earth today. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 13:10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>André, a new elder, has always tried to follow any new direction from Jehovah’s organization.

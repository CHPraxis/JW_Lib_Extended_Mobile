<p><span class="font13">Who Shall Rule the World?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Delivered at City Auditorium, and simultaneously broadcast over a chain of radio stations from Atlanta, Georgia, November 25, 1934, by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HO shall rule the world has been the cause of controversy for centuries past. The greatest controversy of all time is just now beginning, and will bring upon the nations of the earth such tribulation as was never before known, and that will settle for ever the question as to who shall rule the world. The settlement of that question involves the peace, prosperity and life of the entire human race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">| En route to the Pacific coast, Judge | | Rutherford stopped at Atlanta to address | </span><span class="font5">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a vast audience on a subject of the very | | first Importance that can engage the at- | </span><span class="font5">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tention of man. Five sound cars, in differ- | | ent parts of the city, rebroadcast the | | message to almost all Atlanta, while the | | radio carried it to the middle of the </span><span class="font5">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">| Pacific ocean in one direction and to the </span><span class="font5">1 i </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">middle of Europe In the other: half way | | around the world.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Nothing could be of such momentous interest, convenience and necessity to the people as a knowledge of the truth of and concerning the cause of world conditions and what is to be the outcome. I wish that you might understand that what I have to say is not an attack upon any man. My sole purpose is to bring to the attention of the people the indisputable truth, that we may all see what is the proper course for us to take. There is a desperate effort being put forth to prevent the people from hearing the truth at the present time, and if you will bear with me I will tell you the reason. Of necessity the truth is controversial, because it exposes error, and hence the advocates of error always oppose the message of truth. Today the world conditions have reached an acute crisis, and thoughtful persons must lay aside religious and political prejudice and give calm and sober consideration to what is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you are a Protestant, that is no cause or excuse for you to fight your Catholic neighbor. If you are a Catholic, that is no reason why you should persecute one holding a different view. If you have been associated with one great political party, that is no reason why you should war on those of an opposite political faith. My speech on this occasion is not a political speech, nor is it a religious discussion. I am not seeking to induce anyone to join some organization. I only ask that you give calm and sober consideration to a statement of the facts which all of you know to exist, and then to set these facts alongside the truth of God’s Word bearing upon such facts, in order that we may determine what is the right course to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You will readily agree that in every nation the political and economic conditions are entirely unsatisfactory. Since the World War many different men have aspired to rule the people in an arbitrary manner. The people were induced to believe that the great war of 1914 would result in making the world safe for democracy. Had that fantastic prediction been realized it would have meant a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. The slogan, however, proved to be even more elusive than a dream. Italy was on the winning side of that war, and today that nation is ruled by a dictator and democracy is there unknown. Russia fell between the battle lines and the Soviets came into power, and in that government there is no democracy. Germany was on the losing side of the war, and now that nation is arbitrarily ruled by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a dictator and all the people are in great dread. Each one of the dictators aspires to be the world ruler. In America there is what is called a democracy, but the people have little or nothing to say about their government. They vote for supposed public servants, but the elected ones do as they are told by a few men. A bureaucracy would be a better name for the government. The World War did not make this nation safe for democracy, by any means.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Europe a Welter of Confusion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Out of all the world confusion came the League of Nations, and the claim was that it would establish peace and prosperity and rule the world harmoniously. That makeshift is already a failure and is doomed to pass away leaving no beneficial results to the human race. In every nation fear has possessed the people. What rights they once enjoyed and were supposed to possess they now fear to assert. They know no one to whom they may look to lead them out of the dismal swamp of despair. Everywhere the people are in perplexity, and they look to the future with fear and dread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries a foreign power, having its seat of operation at Rome, and parading under a religious name, has had its covetous eyes fixed upon America. Today that subtle power seemingly is exercising a supernatural influence over other organizations of men and it is stealthily and subtly moving forward to lay its slimy hand upon the wealth of the nation and take away from the people their last vestige of liberty. In order to do that they are scheming to rule the nation with a mailed fist. I venture the prediction that unless there is a decided change in their operations within two years that religious, commercial, and political combine will have so completely carried forward their selfish schemes that the American people will be completely bound hand and foot and their once boasted liberty entirely gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the public press published on the first day of this month I quote the following: “Reds riot in Holland, French cavalry shoot down the Parisian mob. German Nazis fall before firing squads of other Nazis, and Russian peasants starve to fulfil Moscow’s orders. Austrian Socialists die on barricades, and the Austrian chancellor lies murdered in a putsch. Polish anti-Semites kill Jews, and the Polish Minister of the Interior dies by an assassin’s bullet. Rumania mourns a slain premier, France her foreign minister, and Yugoslavia her king. This is the continental Europe scene in the year 1934.” Thus is described a horrible condition existing throughout the entire earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Conspiracy Against America</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">And what about the American nation, once known as the “land of the free and the home of the brave”? What has become of the noble-hearted statesmen that once guarded the general welfare of the people? They have practically disappeared. The time was in America when the farmer felt free to till his land and lie down in peace at night and soundly rest. Today farmers are so perplexed and distressed, because they are required to plow up portions of their crops and destroy their pigs, that some of them in utter despair commit suicide. The tax burdens of the people are daily being increased while the government issues interest-bearing bonds and obtains money by selling the same, and then uses the money to loan on farms to be secured by mortgage. Within a short time that scheme will permit the politicians and their allies to make the common people ordinary serfs. Millions of American citizens are now entering a winter faced with suffering and starvation. It is not unusual today to hear one say, “It seems that a supernatural power is goading men on to desperation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never before have you known of so much selfishness amongst men. Never before have you observed such covetousness for power and selfish gain. Never before so much unfaithfulness of officeholders toward the people whom they are supposed to represent. In America prohibition brought a wave of crime that swept many into untimely graves and debauched the lives of many more. The repeal of prohibition is attended with even worse conditions and a constant increase of crime. Every issue of the public press tells of all manner of wickedness, crime and suicides that are being committed. This is but a mild statement of the facts as they exist, and it is useless for us to try to close our eyes to these facts. Let us face the facts calmly and make an honest endeavor to learn the cause and to ascertain if there is a possible remedy. What is the cause of these conditions of woe that now afflict the people of all nations of the earth? Can the responsibility be laid at the door of any political party ? Is there a sure and safe remedy to which the people may pin their hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The full and complete answer to these questions is found in only the Bible, which is God’s Word of truth. Long centuries ago by His holy prophets God foretold the coming about of exactly the conditions that you now see and experience. There are millions of Bibles in the land, but there are few persons who have any knowledge or understanding thereof. The people have been kept in ignorance of the truth as it is set forth in the Bible, and that condition of ignorance is due to the subtle machinations of our common enemy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>America Claims to Be Christian</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">For more than a hundred years this nation has claimed to be a Christian nation, which means that the people of the nation are supposed to believe and rely upon the Word of God and of Christ Jesus. I beg you as sober-minded persons to prove at least to some degree that this is a Christian people by giving heed to what the Word of God says concerning these unhappy things that now exist. At Proverbs </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">29:2</span><span class="font6"> it is written: ‘When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” That the people all over the earth now are mourning is an indisputable fact. Can it be properly said, then, that the dictators that rule in the various nations are the wicked referred to in the scripture just quoted? Primarily, No. Those men are only the agents of the great invisible wicked one; and that means that those men have been made blind to the truth and have been goaded on by an unseen influence to desperate deeds. In that same chapter of Proverbs (verse 18) it is written: “Where there is no vision [or understanding], the people perish.” The various earthly dictators are merely men, and, having no vision or understanding of God’s purpose, those men are blind guides, and they are leading the blind people. All must fall into the ditch, except those who get an understanding and change their course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who, then, is the wicked ruler mentioned in the scripture just quoted? The true answer is that said wicked one is Satan, the Devil, the invisible overlord or ruler of the world. At 1 John 5:19 it is written that the whole world lies in that wicked one, Satan. Jesus Christ, the greatest teacher ever on earth, repeatedly stated that Satan the Devil is the invisible ruler or god of this wicked world. (John 12:31; 8:44) It is written, in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4, that Satan is the god of this world and that he blinds men to the truth. At Revelation 12:17 is found the proof that Satan attempts to destroy all those who in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments tell the truth of and concerning God’s coming kingdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Identity of Real Malefactor</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">You have said time and again that it seems that there is an unseen power that holds sway over the nations and people; and in that conclusion you are correct. That unseen power is Satan and a host of wicked angels, or spirit creatures, who operate with him to wrongfully influence and control man. Not only that, Satan the Devil uses men who wrongfully claim to represent God and Christ, to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. Such men attempt to prevent you from hearing or reading anything that would make clear to you the Scriptures. Instead of encouraging the people to study the Bible, they use all means within their power to prevent the people from hearing and learning what the Bible contains. That of itself is the best evidence that such men do not represent God and Christ, but that they are blinded by our common enemy, Satan, and that they serve him and deceive the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You know that the visible rulers of the nations of the earth are extremely selfish and that human schemes are operated to accomplish selfish ends. Those in power are proud, boasters, unthankful and unrighteous. Never before in the history of man was there so much peril threatening the peoples of all nations. What is the Scriptural explanation thereof? Long ago God caused to be written, at 2 Timothy 3:1-4, the answer in these words: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.” These are the last days, and are fraught with great peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the practice of “Christian religion”, so called, has become merely a formalism and is entirely void of the spirit of God. Further speaking of those who lead in the practice of formal Christian religion the scripture states (2 Timothy 3:5): “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that “perilous times” have come and that the people suffei' and mourn and are in despair is conclusive proof that we have reached the “last days” long ago foretold by the Bible. What is the meaning of the Scriptural term here used, “the last days”? It does not mean the end of time, because time never ends. It does mean the end of Satan’s rule of the world is at hand; hence these are “the last days” of the operation of that wicked ruler. It means that a world crisis has been reached and the nations are in a transition period and that we stand at the portals of a righteous rule of the world wherein the people will have an opportunity to avail themselves of the blessings of a righteous government. What, then, could be of such vital interest, necessity and convenience to the people as a knowledge of the truth of and concerning this matter?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Wicked Ruler</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">You should know how the Devil became the invisible ruler of the world and what will bring about the complete end of his wicked rule. The brief Scriptural account thereof is this: When God created the perfect man and put him on the earth He made His spiritual son Lucifer the overlord or invisible ruler of man. Lucifer, having a covetous and ambitious desire to commercialize and use the human race for his own wicked ends, rebelled against Jehovah God. He led the perfect man into sin, thereby causing him to be sentenced to death, and, by inheritance, death passed upon all men, and since then all men have been born imperfect, and for that reason men have been dying. (Romans 5:12) God then and there changed the name of Lucifer, and since that time Lucifer has been known by the four names: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Satan,</span><span class="font6"> meaning the adversary of God; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Devil,</span><span class="font6"> meaning slanderer; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon, </span><span class="font6">meaning the devourer; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent,</span><span class="font6"> meaning the deceiver who deceives and attempts to devour all men or destroy their prospects for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan the Devil challenged Jehovah God to put on the earth any man who under a crucial test would remain true and faithful to Jehovah. Satan boasted that he could turn all men away from and cause them to curse God. To the end that this question of supremacy might be completely and for ever settled in the right way, and that a way might be provided for mankind to gain life everlasting, Jehovah God accepted the challenge of Satan and permitted him to put forth all his power in an effort to carry out his wicked boast. The settlement of that controversy must of necessity determine who is supreme or the all-powerful ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God sentenced Satan to death at the time of his rebellion, but deferred the execution of that sentence until a future time. He permitted Satan to remain for a long period of time that this question of supremacy might be fully tried and that all creation might have an opportunity to see it settled once and for ever. It is therefore written that Jehovah said to Satan (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser</span><span class="font6">): “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thereafter Satan the Devil builded his own organization, which at all times has been wicked, and in his organization he has used wicked angels and wicked men. By the prophecy of Daniel God foretold that wicked spirits and wicked human creatures would “bear rule over all the earth” for a long period of time. (Daniel 2:39) In keeping with these prophetic statements the facts are that all the nations of the earth have been ruled in wickedness and not one has been righteous.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Typical Nation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Israelites were God’s chosen people, organized by Him into a typical nation by which He foretold His purpose to establish in due time a righteous rule of the world by and through His great Son, the Messiah. The Israelites had an opportunity to prove their integrity toward God, but only a few of them did so. The nation fell away to the Devil and became wicked, and for that reason God cast that people away and permitted them to be destroyed as a nation. At the time of the overthrow of the last king of Israel Jehovah declared that He would not interfere with Satan’s rule of the world until the coming of Him whose right it is to rule and that then that rightful Ruler should rule in righteousness. (Ezekiel 21: 25-27) A long period of time must follow till the coming of the rightful Ruler; and in that period of time Satan has been the god or invisible ruler of the whole world. He is that one who oppresses the people and defames Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Righteous Ruler</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures declare, “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.” (Proverbs 29:2) Who, then, is the rightful Ruler of the world, who will rule in righteousness? The scripture answers: Christ Jesus, the Son of Jehovah God, the Redeemer of the human race, the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and who is the great Prince of Peace. From the days of the prophets till now order-loving people have waited, prayed and hoped for the coming of the true and righteous Ruler of the world who shall rule and bring peace and prosperity. When that righteous rule is established the people will be happy and prosperous, and never before that time can they be prosperous and happy. Today the nations stand in darkness, but at the very portals of the bright and happy day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Satan has been carrying on his wicked rule Jehovah God has been preparing His royal house for the establishment of the government of righteousness. Mark now the progressive steps in carrying forward the great divine purpose. More than 1900 years ago Jehovah sent Jesus to earth as His representative to tell the truth to those who would hear, and to redeem the human race from death, and to make ready for His kingdom. Jesus began His ministry by boldly declaring that He is God’s chosen one to rule the world in the place and stead of Satan, the wicked one. It is plainly written in the Bible, at Matthew 4:8-10, that the Devil offered to turn over the rulership of the world to Jesus upon the condition that Jesus would honor and worship the Devil, which offer Jesus flatly refused. From that time forward Satan sought to kill Jesus Christ. To accomplish this purpose he resorted to all manner of wicked means. He poisoned the mind of the clergy of that day against Jesus, and they tried to kill Jesus. To those clergymen Jesus said (John 8:40,43,44): “Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God [my Father]. . . . Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speak-eth of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” This proves that the mere fact that a man claims to represent God is no evidence whatsoever of the truth of such claim. It is written, in Romans 6:16, that ‘man is the servant of him whom he serves’. If you find men, therefore, who claim to be servants of God and of Christ but who are persecuting others who are serving God and Christ, and trying to prevent them from telling the truth to the people as it is set forth in the Scriptures, then you may know for a certainty that such persecutors are not the servants of God but are the servants of God’s enemy, the Devil.—John 15:19-21; 2 Corinthians 4:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan and his agents continued to persecute Jesus to the end, and God suffered them to crucify His beloved Son. When Jesus died Satan concluded that he had destroyed the world’s rightful Ruler, but Jehovah exhibited His own supreme power, to the disappointment of Satan. God raised Jesus Christ out of death and exalted Him to the highest place in the universe and made Him Lord and Ruler of the whole world. Concerning this God caused to be written in the Scriptures these words (Philippians 2:9-11): “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—See also Acts 3: 26; Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Period of Waiting</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus Christ ascended into heaven, why did He not then, as the world’s rightful Ruler, begin His rule? The Scriptural answer is, because it was not God’s due time for Him to begin to rule the world. Therefore God said to Jesus, as recorded in Psalm 110:1: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Acts 2:34,35; Hebrews 10:13) That meant that a long period of waiting must elapse till Christ would begin His rule of the world. Within that period of waiting God has been taking out of the world other men whom He has made His witnesses, and who must continue to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ concerning Jehovah and His kingdom. (Acts 15:14) The apostles were the first ones taken out, and they immediately began, at Pentecost, to declare to the people that Jesus Christ is the world’s rightful Ruler. Their testimony was a challenge to Satan’s right to rule the world, and hence the Devil continuously persecuted the apostles. They were charged with sedition and treason and other crimes, were thrown into prison, and beaten, and were finally killed because of their faithfulness unto God and unto Christ as witnesses to the truth. For the same reason others of the early period of the Christian era suffered martyrdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Change</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Then in the fourth century a great change came about. And why that change? Because the Boman Catholic hierarchy was organized and professed followers of Christ Jesus in that organization entered into politics and attempted to rule the nations of the earth, falsely claiming that they and their allies were ruling by divine right as Christ’s representatives on earth. That course they took doubtless because they were entrapped by the Devil and caused to serve him. From then till now the Roman Catholic hierarchy has persecuted every man on earth who has boldly given testimony to the truth of God’s Word and His kingdom. They persecuted the Protestants until the Protestant organizations entered into politics and ceased to protest, and then the two religious organizations became close bedfellows. Now the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Protestant clergy, and the Jewish rabbis walk hand in hand, participate in the politics of the world, support wicked and selfish organizations that oppress the people, and persecute everyone who dares to tell the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom. The big radio corporations of the world, owned and controlled by selfish interests, permit their facilities to be used only by this allied company of political religionists and refuse their facilities for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the people the plain truths of God’s Word. The effort of Satan and his agents is to keep the people in ignorance of the world’s rightful Ruler and of His righteous government by which He will rule the earth for the benefit of men. There are millions of good people in the Catholic and in the Protestant organizations who are in no wise responsible for the derelictions of their clergy and leaders; and those millions of people are entitled to hear the truth, that each one of them may determine for himself what course he wants to take. For that reason the truth is now being brought to the attention of all persons who desire to hear.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>End of Waiting</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah having fixed a time limit for Satan to attempt the execution of his wicked boast to turn all men away from God, that period of waiting must come to an end sometime. The prophecies of the Bible, including the great prophecy uttered by Jesus Christ, show that such period of waiting must end in 1914, and that then Christ Jesus, the rightful Ruler of the world, would begin His reign. At that time Jehovah God sent forth Christ Jesus, saying to Him, as written in Psalm 110: 2: &quot;Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” The prophecies show that the time of the end of Satan’s world would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence and distress of nations, and the perplexity amongst men. (Matthew 24: 3-13) The physical facts conclusively prove the beginning of the fulfilment of that prophecy was in 1914, thus disclosing the clear and proper understanding of the prophecy. At the same time, as the prophecy shows, there would also be a war in the invisible realm between Christ Jesus and Satan, and that the result would be the defeat of Satan and the casting of Satan and his angels down to earth. (Revelation 12:7-9) This having taken place, the Devil now confines his wicked work to the peoples and nations of this earth and is making a desperate attempt to turn all mankind away from God and to plunge them into destruction. You well know that since the beginning of the World War the distress and woe upon the peoples of earth have continued to increase; and the reason therefor is that Satan, having been cast down to earth, brings these woes upon mankind, as it is written in Revelation 12:12: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” That is the real reason why there is now so much suffering and distress on earth. The Devil is trying to keep the people in ignorance of this fact while he prepares his forces for Armageddon. He particularly uses religionists to blind the people to the truth. This I say that those who hear may begin to think for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures also show that approximately at the same time the Lord gathers unto himself His faithful witnesses whom He has selected to give testimony before the peoples of the earth. He commits His testimony concerning the world rulership to His witnesses, and who are named in the Scriptures as Jehovah’s witnesses, and these the Lord sends forth to deliver His testimony.—Revelation 12:17; Isaiah 43:10-12.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>A Challenge</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Necessarily this testimony delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, announcing that Christ Jesus is earth’s rightful Ruler, is a direct challenge to the Devil, and a declaration of war against him; and for that reason the Scriptures declare that the old Dragon, the Devil, makes war against Jehovah’s witnesses who keep the commandments of Jehovah God. (Revelation 12:17) Because Christ Jesus when on the earth testified to the truth and declared himself the King, whom God had selected to rule the world, Satan sought to kill Him. For the same reason now the Devil and his emissaries vigorously oppose the testimony delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses and seek to kill them. For this reason Jesus has said to His faithful followers (John 15: 20): “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In fulfilment of this prophetic statement the Roman Catholic hierarchy now takes the lead in a world-wide cruel campaign in opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses; and this is positive proof that such opposition is carried on at the command and instance of the Devil, and all who join in this opposition to the message concerning God and His kingdom under Christ put themselves on the side of the Devil. Jehovah’s witnesses are few in number, and in themselves are of little importance. To be sure, the Roman Catholic hierarchy and her allies are not at all afraid of Jehovah’s witnesses, but both they and their father are afraid of the message of truth which these witnesses, by God's grace, deliver to the people, because that message tells the people that within a very short time Satan’s organization shall be completely destroyed and that Christ Jesus shall rule the world in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the present time the Roman Catholic hierarchy maintains a publicity bureau in Washington, D.C., and from that headquarters copy is sent to every part of “Christendom”, and all the Catholic newspapers use that copy and engage in the publication of all manner of vicious and slanderous falsehoods against Jehovah’s witnesses. Why is that done? Because Jehovah’s witnesses are announcing that the Almighty God Jehovah is supreme, and that Christ is His King, and that Satan’s rule of the world must completely end within a short time. Jehovah’s witnesses are not complaining, nor are they asking any quarter of men. By the Scriptures they have been fully informed that this opposition would develop, even before it began, and if it had not come they would have been disappointed. This cruel opposition is only further evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses are right and have the approval of the Almighty God and of Christ His King. For that reason men and women who make up the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses now go from house to house throughout the land, exhibiting to the people in book form the message concerning God and Christ and His kingdom. They call attention of the people to these truths emphasizing the fact that the change of the rulership of the world is now at hand. The more the Roman Catholic hierarchy and her allies oppose, the more Jehovah’s witnesses will rejoice and sing the praises of God and His King. They know the fight is on to a finish, and that God will win. It is a glorious fight, and will continue to increase in glory, and will have a glorious end. Never has there been such a joyful company of people on earth as Jehovah’s witnesses, because they are privileged to be the publicity agents of the Almighty God and His King and to announce to the people that soon oppression shall end and righteousness shall rule the world. Let all of Satan’s agents take notice now that the end is near and that all such opposers or enemies of God and His kingdom will meet everlasting defeat. The Bible proof, fully supported by the physical facts, is set forth in detail in the books that are brought to your door by Jehovah’s witnesses, and by the study of such you may clearly see the reason for the present world distress, what shall shortly follow, and what is the complete remedy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Abomination</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For</span><span class="font6"> centuries those who love God have been looking for the coming of Christ Jesus and His kingdom. Now the King is upon His throne, and it is the will of God that announcement of this stupendous truth shall be made to the peoples of earth. During the World War some clergymen in London issued a manifesto to the effect that the extraneous evidence then apparent showed that the kingdom of Christ was at hand. Shortly thereafter, however, the League of Nations was brought forth as the scheme for ruling the world, and at once the clergy of “Christendom” hailed the League of Nations as a substitute for God’s kingdom on earth. Now the leaders amongst the Catholics, Protestants and Jews unite to declare that the League of Nations is the only light of the world. The League of Nations being made a substitute for God’s kingdom under Christ, necessarily that League is an abomination in the sight of Almighty God. Both the prophet Daniel and Jesus Christ speak of “the abomination that maketh desolate” because it stands in the holy place, where it ought not to stand, that is to say, as a substitute for God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mark now the advice which Jesus Christ gives to the people of good will concerning that abomination (Matthew 24:15,16): “When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judsea flee into the mountains.” Those of Judea here mentioned are the ones who are in heart sympathy with the kingdom of God under Christ; hence they are persons of good will. The mountains mentioned here symbolically mean Jehovah God and His organization under Christ. Therefore the advice of Christ Jesus is to all people of good will, that they now “flee to the mountains”, that is to say, take their stand on the side of God and Christ and His kingdom, and that they do by entirely forsaking Satan’s organization. The Lord admonishes such persons of good will to separate themselves from selfish world organizations and not to try to seek honor at the hands of men nor to uphold the institutions that are against the kingdom of God. He admonishes all such to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God before the “winter” time. The words “winter time” there used symbolically mean the time of great suffering and distress which will come at the battle of Armageddon. Why does Jesus warn the people to flee now? He answers that question in these words (Matthew 24: 21): “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Armageddon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">That stupendous tribulation is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, otherwise named in the Scriptures “Armageddon”. In the book called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font6"> you will find a full description of that great battle, how it will be fought, and what will be the result. Here I can only say that now all the nations of earth are gathering together under Satan’s leadership to the battle of Armageddon. That will be a war and slaughter such as never before was known in the history of man. Both the invisible and visible forces of the universe will fight, and many of them will die. But by far the greatest fighting will be amongst the unseen forces. Christ Jesus, the mighty Warrior and Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah will lead the fight on the side of righteousness. Why should there be such a great battle? The reason is that Satan the Devil will not give way to the world’s rightful Ruler, and therefore Satan and his organization must be and will be completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Right Hand and Executioner for Jehovah God is Christ Jesus. Satan and all of his host are the enemies of God, and concerning these it is written, in Psalm 21: 8-10: &quot;Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.” That destruction of the enemies of God will include all the visible and invisible ones who oppose God and His kingdom, as it is written, in Psalm 104: 35: “Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.” All who support Satan’s wicked rule of the world, and who are therefore the friends of the world, are God’s enemies, and concerning that it is written, at James 4:4: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visible kings and rulers of the earth, made up of the commercial, political and religious elements, are now in a conspiracy against Jehovah and His kingdom, as it is written (Psalm 2:2-9): “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic hierarchy and its arrogant allies now think they can assault with impunity Jehovah’s witnesses and bring reproach upon God’s holy name and get away with it. They will find, however, that in the battle of Armageddon their wealth, worldly influence, position and power amongst men will afford them no help whatsoever and that there will be no place for them to escape, as it is written, in Jeremiah’s prophecy (25: 33-35): “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Righteous Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Let all the people who desire to see a righteous government now be calm and sober-minded. Cease fighting or quarreling over immaterial matters. No political party can bring you relief and happiness. No church organization can bring what you desire. No earthly organization can bring you any real blessing; because all those things must soon pass away. The world crisis is here, and the all-important question is concerning God’s kingdom of righteousness and man’s relation thereto. Christ Jesus the King is the righteous and elect servant of Jehovah God to whom Jehovah has committed the rulership of the world, and concerning Him Jehovah says through His prophet (Matthew 12:18, 21): ‘Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon Him,and He shall show judgment to the nations. And in His name shall the nations hope.’ (Isaiah 42:1, 3) You find no hope of relief by looking to the rulers of this wicked world, and here is the positive statement of Almighty God that in the name of Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, shall the nations hope. And why shall the people hope in His name? The prophet of God answers, at Isaiah 9: 6, 7: “For . . . the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of [Jehovah] of hosts will perform this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures name Satan as the prince of darkness who keeps the people in the dark concerning God and His kingdom of righteousness under Christ. Those who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, and wholly devoted themselves to Him and Jehovah, have been taken out of darkness into the light of truth; and these are commanded to make known the truth to others, that they also might hear and obey the Lord. (Colossians 1:13; 1 Peter 2: 9, 10) That is the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses in these days are calling at your homes to tell you the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the time of great darkness upon the earth as it is written in Isaiah 60:2: “For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” This is the time when Jehovah says to His faithful witnesses on earth: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” These witnesses must point the people to the fact that Jehovah is supreme and that Christ Jesus is the Leader of the people and the world’s rightful Ruler. The nations of earth are sick unto death, and the people are at the point of desperation. In this hour of great peril Jehovah says to the people, as it is written (Isaiah 55: 3,4): “Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of [the Beloved]. Behold, I have given him [Christ Jesus] for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” Christ Jesus and His kingdom is the hope of the world, and there is none other. He is the rightful and invisible Ruler of the world, whom God has appointed to destroy Satan’s organization and to establish righteousness amongst men.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Visible Rulers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Since Christ Jesus will always be invisible to human eyes, there must be men on earth who will rule as His visible representatives. Such men as Hitler, Mussolini, the Catholic hierarchy, and the selfish politicians of America, will have nothing whatsoever to do with the rule of the nations of the earth under Christ. No man of that kind will have anything to do with God’s kingdom; and that is stated at Daniel 2: 44. The men who will represent Christ Jesus on earth as the visible rulers amongst the people will be such men as Abraham and Moses, a list of the names of which men appears in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. Those faithful men of old saw by faith the day coming when God would have a righteous government on the earth. They desired that government and they devoted themselves to Jehovah. Amidst great persecution heaped upon them by Satan and his agents those men maintained their integrity toward God and died faithful to Him. They must remain dead until God's due time to awaken them out of death; and that due time is at hand. The Scriptures give full assurance that those faithful men shall be resurrected soon as perfect men and made the representatives on earth of the world ruler Christ Jesus. (Hebrews 11:39,40) In former days those faithful men were called “fathers” in Israel because under the direction of the Lord they tried to lead the Israelites in the right way. (Psalm 45:16) “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle Peter under inspiration wrote concerning the new world rule, which is composed of the “new heaven”, or invisible part, and the “new earth”, the visible part, and then said (2 Peter 3:13): “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” The battle of the great day of God Almighty will mark the passing away for ever of the old, wicked world, and then shall come into full sway and full view the new and righteous rule. Today we stand at the very portals of that righteous world rule, and to us Jehovah says (Isaiah 32:1,17,18): “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under that righteous rule there will never be another war, nor even the fear of war, because Armageddon will mark the end of all war. The kingdom of God will be over all the nations. (Isaiah 2:4) “And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the righteous rule of Christ there will be no officials who will collect money by taxation, and then loan that money to the farmer with a view to making the farmer a serf. There will no more be the harsh and oppressive government agents to browbeat and put in fear the people and harshly judge and misuse them. Armageddon will end all oppression, as it is written (Psalm 72:4): “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.” No more shall men be put in fear of losing their homes, which they have builded at great effort and sacrifice, nor shall they be compelled to destroy portions of their crops, and their animals, in order to make higher prices. Concerning this it is written (Isaiah 65:21): “And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them”; (Micah 4: 4) “and none shall make them afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people will grow into health and strength and will come to a knowledge of the truth, and those who learn the truth and obey God and His King, Christ Jesus, shall be granted everlasting life on the earth. For this reason God provided redemption of man from death through Christ Jesus; and therefore a knowledge of the truth is now of the greatest importance to the people, because, said Jesus Christ (John 17:3): “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Contrast</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">More than 6,000 years of world history has been written, and every page thereof is smeared with human blood unrighteously shed. God has declared that due recompense must be made for that wicked slaughter of humankind. In every age wars of conquest have been waged resulting in robbing the common people of their just rights, while the marauders have lived wantonly upon their ill-got gains. During all the ages political gangsters, claiming to represent the interests of the people, have played into the hands of the greedy and heartless commercial highwaymen, who have carried on their business in an apparently legal manner, but to the detriment of the people. In all of these centuries religionists hypocritically have claimed to serve God, but by their course of action they have continuously brought reproach upon His name and upon the name of Christ Jesus, and they have turned the masses of the people into darkness and despair. Such are the fruits of the world ruled by Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time was in America when the nation stood for liberty, freedom of speech, and freedom of press. Today human liberty has practically disappeared and the fundamental law of the land, represented in the Constitution of the United States, is treated as a mere scrap of paper. No longer can men freely speak the truth without being subjected to all manner of vilification at the hands of those who are against the truth. The time was when the public press published news that was of public interest and convenience. Today the public press is the tool of the heartless, commercial and political rulers and it publishes the very opposite of the truth. The metropolitan press is in fact the propaganda instrument used by and for the selfish interests and is against God and His kingdom message and refuses to publish that which is of public interest, convenience and necessity. Each issue of the great newspapers carries glaring headlines telling of rape, kidnaping, theft, robbery, murder, and suicide. These things are the fruits of the satanic rule of the world. Is it your desire to see such wicked rule continue for ever, or have you had enough of it?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Futile Hopes of Reform</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The present unrighteous rule of the world holds forth not one vestige of hope for humankind. That part of the world called “Christendom” is in a particularly unhappy state. Men who once called upon the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus laid the foundation of the American nation that it might be an asylum for those persecuted in and driven from other lands, and that it might be the home of those who would promote the general welfare. Today such true and stalwart men have practically disappeared. America, like other countries of “Christendom”, is ruled by ultraselfish men, and its institutions hold out no inducement for the youth to grow into God-fearing men and women. The visible religious-political leaders march the people through the streets in the name of Christ, and yet every act and word of such leaders dishonors the name of Jehovah God and His King. “Christendom” has become a mockery and a reproach to Jehovah’s name; and this has been accomplished by Satan’s overreaching and using the leaders of religion falsely called “Christianity”. Why should the people of good will longer stand in the darkness and mourn in despair?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Look now with hope to the kingdom of righteousness. In this hour of great distress and sorrow the trumpet message sounds calling your attention to the mighty truth that Jehovah is the supreme and almighty God, that Christ is the King and the righteous and rightful Ruler who has taken His power, and that His rule will bring the desire of all honest hearts and will bestow boundless blessings upon all who are obedient to His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rule of the world under Christ Jesus not only will bring lasting peace and prosperity, but also will give to the people liberty, health and strength, lead them fully into the paths of righteousness, and bestow upon them everlasting life here upon the earth. Your beloved dead shall return from the graves and all who love God and His King shall then walk together amidst the flowers beside the peaceful waters, singing together the praises of the Most High. Tears of bitterness will cease to flow, and the fear of death will for ever disappear. In beautiful symbolic phrase the revelator says concerning that glorious world (Revelation 21:1-4) that ‘Jehovah God will wipe away all tears from the eyes of men and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, and no more pain; for the former wicked things of the world are passed away’.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Armageddon a Necessity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The battle of Armageddon, which is just ahead, will open the gates of that glorious and righteous rule of the world, and which righteous rule will be seen and felt upon the earth. Because of the great change for good that is just at hand God commands His witnesses on the earth to now (Psalm 96:10) ‘say to the nations that the Lord Jesus Christ reigns, the world shall be established that it shall not be moved; He shall judge the people in righteousness’. Bo you desire that world rulership and the blessings it will bring?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regardless of what men might want, Christ Jesus is now the rightful Ruler of the world and is going to rule the world in righteousness. All the wicked He will destroy. All the people will have an opportunity to choose to serve the Devil and be destroyed or to serve Jehovah God and His King and live. The time for you to choose is now here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let every person, both in this visible and in the invisible audience, who sincerely desires to see the world ruled in righteousness, and who desires to enjoy these blessings which God has provided through Christ Jesus, take his stand now on the side of the Lord. Then inform yourselves of the great truths of God’s Word now due to be understood, seek righteousness, and do right, prove your integrity to God and His King, and your blessings shall be complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I now call upon all in this and in the invisible God and His righteous King to arise and say, audience who desire to be on the side of Jehovah Aye!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>An “Evangelist” in South Carolina</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Norman Greenway,</span><span class="font6"> who calls himself an • evangelist, didn’t mean to advertise Judge Rutherford’s Atlanta lecture of November 25. But that is what W. Norman Greenway did, and so, indirectly at least, he did, for once in his life, become an instrument calling attention to a real message of good news. For Judge Rutherford told in his lecture how Christ would be the new ruler of the world, and would bring everlasting peace. . . . But that is getting ahead of our story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “evangelist” had been singing hell-fire and brimstone and kindred errors in Greenville for several weeks, and thought he had the Devil well on the run, when a notice in the paper made him shudder and shake and then rise up with quixotic courage in his determination to give the Devil (as he thought) one last devastating blow. For the notice which Greenway saw said that Judge Rutherford was going to speak from Atlanta and would be heard in Greenville over WFBC. Greenway gnashed his teeth (Acts 7:54); the very thought of Judge Rutherford and his message coming right into the territory he had been so vigorously trying to barnstorm aroused him to irrational vehemence. He announced that he had challenged the judge and that when the judge came to Atlanta he would challenge him again. He said he would reply to Judge Rutherford’s broadcast over the same radio station, and immediately following the judge’s broadcast. But the station manager could not give him the time, and said he would have to take time preceding the Watch Tower program. Greenway had previously arranged to install a receiving set at the tabernacle to bring in the talk which he intended to “answer”. He arranged to have his own talk broadcast from the tabernacle by remote control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunday afternoon, November 25, at three o’clock, Mr. Greenway, in true “evangelical” manner, ascended the platform and called a Western Union boy to receive the challenge, which was first read, in a loud voice, to the audience of about 2,000. He handed the boy a dollar and told him to keep the change. He then asked all of Jehovah’s witnesses present to go home. Nobody left the tabernacle. Greenway then brought out some books by Judge Rutherford and read selections from these, throwing one after another to the floor of the platform, and saying, “I am through with that one, and it is baloney.” He said the judge taught there was no Jesus until He was born into the world; that the judge did not recognize the holy spirit because he did not write “holy spirit” with capital letters; that the judge did not believe in the remission of sin; that the judge said there was no hell; that he taught the people to do as they liked and they would have another chance to get right with God after death; and that (summing it all up) the judge was a liar, coward and false prophet. He told the people to be sure to get Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> and read it and then burn it and all other books by Judge Rutherford they had and ask God to forgive them for reading such trash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout his tirade Greenway bellowed so loudly that those listening in over the radio had difficulty in hearing what he said, and a telegram was received advising him of the fact. He stepped back from the microphone, but no improvement resulted. Greenway finished his lying assault in a final effort to be funny, saying, “Those who wish can remain and hear the judge,” but that he had hung the judge’s hide on the fence and wanted to see if he could get it down. Then the evangelist walked off the platform, followed by his singer; and about twenty of the audience left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evidently the remainder took the situation seriously, for they stayed and wanted to hear Judge Rutherford, whose voice came in clearly and smoothly. One of the ushers began to create confusion by asking people to change seats, but he was soon called down and the people heard the judge through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Greenway left Greenville the following Sunday. He had dealt the Devil an unintentional but effective blow by gathering 2,000 people to listen to Judge Rutherford’s logical presentation of Scriptural truth, which reasonable presentation was all the more appreciated in contrast with the evangelist’s ravings.</span></p>

All he lost was his liberty, for he landed in jail. Now he wishes he had been honest and not been a foursquare evangelist. After being an evangelist it is hard to be straight.</span></p>

Mrs. Stephens says: “I must mention that my own family and a few others in this isolated spot (families are from two to ten miles from each other) are keenly interested in the splendid work you and your associates are doing in God’s name, and we greatly appreciate the opportunity that has been afforded us to understand the Word of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font6">As a little preparation for reading the backhanded compliment which follows, we might say that in the eyes of the clergy Jesus Christ never had any authority for what He said or did, and has none now. All power and authority, in their minds, reside in them and in the Devil, their lord and master. What there is of truth in the following is, of course, exceedingly harmful to the Devil’s organization, but it is for the good of the people, and this statement is true in general. The best thing that could possibly happen to the people is to get away from the Devil’s organization, and quit following the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which is the chief instrument of the Devil’s organization on the earth. All that is said about signatures’ having been falsely obtained is a lie out of whole cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JUDGE RUTHERFORD’S REI JGI0N</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Charles Hawkes, Smithton, Tasmania, asks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Considering the number of books, etc., by Judge Rutherford, of the Bible Students’ Association of America, can you tell me the trend, gist, and authority of this organization, and if harmful or otherwise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford is really the successor of Pastor Charles T. Russell, who founded the Russellites. This organization preferred to call its members Witnesses of Jehovah, and they form what is called the Bible Students’ Association. The Associates do not really study the Bible. They swallow what Judge Rutherford tells them. Now let us turn to your questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Firstly, what is the trend of this organization? Its trend is to turn people into simple fools, impelling them to wander around calling themselves Witnesses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Jehovah, and distributing absurd booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Secondly, what is the gist of the movement? The gist of the business is this: Civil governments and all churches, in fact, all religious, political, and commercial powers in this world organized before the new organization of Judge Rutherford, are the work of Satan, and under the control of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ’s second coming took place in 1914. The war ceased in 1918 especially to allow Judge Rutherford’s Witnesses of Jehovah to wander abroad distributing booklets and broadcasting records of his speeches. All the nations which make up Christendom, and chiefly America and the British Commonwealth of Nations, are to be destroyed any day now, and the sooner the better. Catholics and Protestants alike are going to get what Rutherford calls a “terrible drubbing.” Protestants are going to get a much worse time than Catholics, because Catholics are the more benighted and ignorant. However, G'od is going to smite everybody except those who accept Judge Rutherford as their infallible guide and teacher. Such is the gist of the message preached by the Witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What authority have these people ? None whatever. God never invited them to be His witnesses, nor did He give them such a ridiculous message. Judge Rutherford’s authority as an exponent of Scripture is nil. He betrays no sound scholarship whatever; knows nothing of real principles of interpretation; and violates all logic and reason in the outpourings of his warped imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is the movement harmful or otherwise ? It is harmful from almost every point of view. It is not in the least constructive. It is destructive, not only of Christianity, but of all lawful civil authority. There has been a lot of trouble in America over the broadcast utterances of Judge Rutherford. The radio stations refused to handle his matter, and the Witnesses of Jehovah protested to the Radio Commission that, even though they were ready to pay for time, the stations would not sell it to them. The case went to Congress in March last, and the McFadden bill was introduced in their favor. The Witnesses of Jehovah handed in petitions signed by 2,500,000 persons. But it was shown that the signatures were obtained under false pretenses, that many were frank forgeries, and others the names of mere children. The McFadden bill, in favor of Rutherford, was defeated in Congress, and American stations were justified in their refusal to waste people’s time with the anti-political, antiChristian, and insulting propaganda of Judge Rutherford. Thus you have the trend, gist, authority and harmful character of Judge Rutherford’s organization.</span></p>

Sanger, reports having put to 2,000 fallen women the query as to what religion they had been trained in.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIFTEENTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">in the series of short Bible talks by Judge Rutherford appears below. These talks have aroused a great amount of discussion, as they deal with important Bible truths. The subject of the lecture which follows is one that has been greatly misunderstood. The word “Trinity” has become to many people a sort of magic formula of unexplorable depth of meaning. As a matter of fact, neither the word nor the idea sought to be conveyed by it is found in the Word of God. Judge Rutherford handles the subject without gloves, and those who prefer their prejudices to truth would better omit reading this page if they do not wish to have their “sensibilities wounded”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Trinity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE so-called “holy trinity” is one of the false doctrines taught by men. Priests of the Catholic hierarchy have become very angry when the people are told the truth about the “trinity” doctrine. Some of them testified before the Congressional Committee at Washington that a criticism of the “trinity” is so offensive to them that no man should be permitted to use the radio to tell the people about it. Error always objects to being exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doctrine of the “trinity” had its origin with the Devil and was made prominent in the Satanic religions of ancient Babylon and Egypt. It was first introduced into the so-called “Christian church” by a Greek priest in the fourth century. It is a false doctrine because it is contradictory to God's Word. The “trinity” doctrine is that there are “three gods in one, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, equal in power, substance and eternity”. The clergymen call it “a mystery” because they neither understand it nor can explain it, and they therefore discourage the people in trying to find out the real truth about the doctrine. The clergy say, 'God is one, Jesus is one, and the Holy Ghost is one, and these three added together make one.’ That is a kind of mathematics no one can understand or explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth is reasonable, as shown by the Bible, to wit, that Jehovah God is the Almighty One; that Jesus is the Son of God; and that the holy spirit is not a person, but is the invisible power of God operating the things of the universe. In Isaiah 45: 5 God says: 'I am Jehovah; there is no God besides me.’ Jesus, the beginning of God’s creation, says, at Proverbs 8:22: “Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way.” Jehovah used Jesus as His active agent in the creation of all things. When on the earth Jesus said (John 12:49): “I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment.” At Psalm 40 Jesus said: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.” At John 14:28 He said: “My Father is greater than I.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word “ghost” appearing in the Bible is properly translated </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit,</span><span class="font6"> and the original w’ord shows that it means the power which is invisible to human eyes, exercised by Jehovah. For example : You see the power of electricity operating machinery, but you cannot see electricity. God moves the universe by His power, which is invisible to human eyes, that is, by His holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason for this false doctrine of the “trinity” is this: Satan at all times has defamed God’s name and tried to turn all the people away from the true God. To that end he has deceived and defrauded the people; and the doctrine of the “trinity” is one of his means of deception. Satan disputes the supremacy of Jehovah and if he can induce the people to believe that there are two others that are equal to Jehovah in power, substance and eternity, as the clergy teach, then he induces the people to believe that God is not supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that the oldest church organization amongst men teaches the doctrine of the “trinity” does not make it true. We have now reached the end of the world, and the time is here when the truth is due to be understood and will be understood by all who with unprejudiced mind study the Bible and seek to know the truth. Jehovah God is the Eternal One, from everlasting to everlasting; Christ Jesus is His first creature; and the holy spirit is His power. Soon He will exercise His power to destroy Satan’s organization, and only those who believe and serve the truth will survive. If the clergy really believed God and the Bible their sensibilities would not be shocked when someone tells the people what the Bible says about the so-called “trinity”. The fact that they are offended proves that their doctrine is false. It is to your interest to know the truth. Only Jehovah God can give everlasting life, and this He gives through Jesus Christ, His Chief Executive Officer. The harm</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Midsummer Convention in Georgia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">T A MIDSUMMER convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in a country district near Rome, Ga., two neighboring churches prayed that it might rain that day, so that the meeting could not be held. The day was cloudy, but not rainy, until noon, when the skies cleared beautifully. Three weeks later, in the same locality, an immersion was planned. Twenty-five brethren, Primitive Baptists, Missionary Baptists, and Methodists, called upon the chairman of Jehovah’s witnesses to give him notice, so they said, “that bringing in peoples from various places in this section of the state and immersing them in the creek near us in a faith in so much opposition to all the denominational churches must cease; that it had been reported that one of these immersion services would be administered the next day, Sunday, and that at that time there would be some Niggers baptized at the same time as would the whites, and it would be done by the same one immersing the whites; that it could not be done, and that if it was it would not be good for the one doing it.” The committee was informed that the immersion would take place the next day, as planned. All were present, the sheep on one side of the creek, the goats on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the appointed hour the transcription lecture “Flee Now” (Judge Rutherford’s lecture) was given. Everybody on both sides of the creek, and for half a mile around, could hear every word. The goats heard it as well as the sheep. Meantime it rained hard and the goats got their pants all wet; the water they had wanted three weeks previously they got later. After they -were nicely soaked the immersions took place as planned; Jehovah’s witnesses meantime remaining dry and comfortable in their automobiles. After the immersions there was no trouble. The Devil is the biggest bluffer that ever lived. He can do nothing except as that may be permitted from on high, and in this instance it pleased Jehovah God to protect His people from all interference and from all harm, and to send His enemies home with wet pants to think it all over, and to try to figure it out as to why they had let the Devil make such big fools of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Truth Is Better than Gold</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">AYS George Alexis Peck, of Boston: “The truth that I get in your magazine is better to me than gold. My father and his ancestors were all Roman Catholics. My grandfather almost completely built and gave a church to that organization. His only son, my father, had eight children; my father did not get any of his father’s money; we all nearly starved until we got old enough to earn our own living. I went to that church with my father every Sunday until I got old enough to think for myself, and then I left and joined a Protestant church, becoming, for many years, a deacon in the Episcopal church of St. Peter’s, Jamaica Plains. I remained in that church, and other Protestant churches, until I was fifty years of age, learning next to nothing and quite unaware of the powder of Satan the Devil to lie and deceive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“One day a man of Jamaica Plains asked me if I was a member of a church. I said Yes’. He shook his head and said, Tt is too bad that they can deceive a man like you.’ I felt cross and said, ‘What do you mean? What church do you belong to?’ He said, ‘I do not belong to any of these so-called “churches”, but I am a strong believer in Jesus Christ and His teachings and His church; will you please read this little book ?’ I said Wes’, and did, over and over and over, three times; it seemed like a flashlight on the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I went back to my neighbor and asked him where I could get some more of those books; he gave me the address and I sent and procured a complete set. I studied law at the Boston YMCA and in 1916 graduated from Harvard University, having taken up factory management as a specialty, but for a number of years have been but partially employed. With greatly reduced income I have been most happy reading these books and the Bible, and would not take millions of dollars for what I have gained from reading them, and the Bible, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iraculous guidance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your special issue of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Age d’Or<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font5"> manifests the great faith of those who as modern martyrs had to bear the German insanity. They strive bravely for their ideal, the thing that everybody should have in his heart to do. What I admire in them is the courage and bravery that their faith gives them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a Catholic, I have been for a long time tired of the silliness and glittering trash of this religion, of which their servants make a real commercial enterprise. Even for those who give but little proof of reflection, the purchase of an entry into heaven is not feasible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a true believer and not willing to yield to the commercial pantomime of the priests who are such by profession and not at heart, I had my own ideas and had created within myself a religious purpose resembling absolutely that taught by your work. What great joy was mine when I learned of your branch office in Paris by reading one of your books which had been lent me by a friend 1 In a very generous way you then delighted me with a supply of some writings of Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an adherent of the only true religion who only wishes to see an ever increasing number of new learners gather around the proper belief under your miraculous guidance, I assure you of my respectful greetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The message in Esperanto:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have received the two booklets in Esperanto which you were so kind as to send me. They are extremely interesting. I should like to tell you that the Bible also is translated into Esperanto. May I congratulate you heartily for the noble task which you are pursuing unceasingly and with an energy and unselfishness worthy to be praised!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the R. I.—Esperanto, -------, President, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Glory and thanks to Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the trouble through which we have been going since a certain date had come before we began reading your books and booklets, I might have lost my reason; but now I find it quite natural. Glory and thanks to Jehovah for His consolation!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Convinced:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thanks very much to you, sons of the Most High, for your fidelity, your courage, and for this wonderful work! One cannot describe properly how you give comfort by drawing water out of a pure source, which is the Bible, the Word of our God. Bravo! My best wishes and compliments to the honorable Judge Rutherford, who so well accomplishes his difficult task for the benefit of all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How impatiently I wait every month for your beloved journal! Your books and booklets are from now on my sole reading matter. I try to make them known as far as possible around me. You alone have the truth, and you alone know how to give hope in God, our Creator and in Jesus, our Savior! What great change takes place when one gets to know the divine Word!</span></p>

These publications are interesting me and my family very much and we have but one sorrow: not to be able to learn more on this subject, as we are too poor. But it is just through the Scriptures that we </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">got new hope for</span><span class="font5"> better times to come and we are not discouraged. Thanks for having us informed of these things; and please accept, dear friends, our most devoted feelings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Friendship:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Friends : May I commence my letter in this manner as you yourselves in your last letter had the kindness to address your message to me. This means for me, in the time in which we are now living, a great benefit which comes to me from Jehovah. I shall try to be worthy of this title, doing my best in the cause of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Please accept the enclosed amount of ... francs, which is my offering to Jehovah and which amount I got from an account due me which I thought would not be paid. Would you be kind enough to publish and distribute some of your little books at 75 centimes for this sum?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Truth searches out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In November 1933 I bought from Mr. G. R. 5 books. The people here were stirred up on account of this literature, which they thought to be Protestant. I am Catholic, but I do not think I am doing any wrong to my religion. As far as I can discern, although I am not educated, I think this is in accordance with the prophecy of our Lord. I therefore wish to subscribe for a journal to be sent me each month and which costs about 5 francs, as far as I know. I am counting on you!</span></p>

I am living here amidst fanatics who, even if not really convinced of their belief, do not deviate a bit from their ancient traditions.</span></p>

Having belonged to the Catholic religion, we have abandoned the church in order to take our stand definitely on the side of God and His divine Son. The present crisis brought to us moral and material sufferings, but we await with confidence the intervention of the Almighty God who very soon will chase out from the world -wickedness and hypocrisy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">T HAND is a card of “Reverend” Knock’s New and Greater Golden Horseshoe, Wheeling, advertising lunches, dinners, suppers, beer, music and dancing. On the back it says an artist was employed to retouch a large painting on an old church in Belgium and rendered a bill for $100. The church trustees, however, required an itemized bill, and the following was duly presented and paid:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Adjusting the stars, $2.06; brightening flames of hell, 60c; cleaning Balaam’s ass, $5.06; cleaning moon, 10c; correcting ten commandments, $7.10; decorating Noak’s Ark, $6.50; embellishing Pilate, $3.02; enlarging Goliath’s head, $2.03; extending Saul’s leg, $2.05; mending shirt for prodigal son, 35c; painting silver dollar on poor box, 80c; putting earrings in Sarah’s ears, $30; putting a new tail on the Devil, $1.50; new tail on St. Peter’s rooster, $4.18; rebordering the robes of Herod, $1.43; removing soot from Vesuvius, $3.12; restoring lost souls, $25; renewing heaven, $1; taking spots off Tobias, $1; washing feet of priest, $3.10.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just why the “Reverend” Enoch on retiring from the church business went into the restaurant business instead of the farming business was not explained, but he seems adapted to his new line, quite well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Great American Gamble”, an attractive, free booklet, the size of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> put out by the Travelers Insurance Company, Hartford, Conn. We quote a few extracts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If killing and injuring persons by automobiles happened to be as fearsome a menace as the infantile paralysis scare, then perhaps something might be done to stop the highway slaughter. But because too many still seem to consider it a part of each and every person's inalienable right to drive as he chooses, to walk wherever fancy leads, or to gamble with his own life and the lives of others as the stakes, this country goes on killing around 30,000 yearly and injuring nearly a million more.... My own system is to expect the world’s prize idiot around every next corner. When I turn a curve or go over the top of a hill, I hug my side of the road like glue and slow down a bit, because I always picture a congenital imbecile at the wheel of a ear coming at me from the other direction. At an intersection, I always imagine the other intersecting artery filled with morons. Of course, I know this is a pretty cynical slant on my fellow motorists, but I don’t think a group which killed about 30,000 victims and injured some 850,000 others, last year, is worthy of very many medals for bright and shining mentality. The fact is, we have killed more than 325,000 of our friends with motorcars in the last fifteen years in this country, whereas our enemies have killed only 300,000 of us in all our wars to date. Eight hundred persons were killed last year crossing streets against the signal, while only around 200 were killed crossing with the signal. More than 35,000 pedestrians were hit last year by stepping out from behind parked cars. Of the acts of drivers producing deaths last year 33 percent were driving too fast, 19 percent were off the roadway, 14 percent unwisely insisted on right of way, 13 percent were on the wrong side of the road, and 3 percent involved improper passing. Of the acts of pedestrians producing deaths, 31 percent crossed in the middle of the block, 17 percent walked along the road with the traffic instead of facing it, 13 percent were children playing in the street, and 11 percent came from behind parked cars. A car going 40 miles per hour is four times as capable of inflicting damage as at 20 miles. When going 60 miles per hour, it is nine times as capable.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>A Mutual Credit Union in Actual Operation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Wm, Shakespeare, Jr. (Michigan)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">B</span><span class="font6">Y LAW the State of Michigan authorizes loan companies to advance or loan to one individual or family a sum not exceeding $300.00, for which said loan company may charge as interest 3| percent a month, or 42 percent per annum. Another Michigan law recently passed, however, permits groups of so-called “working people” to organize their own credit unions or loan companies; and so today any factory, store, church, school, lodge or, in fact, any similar organization, may establish its own credit union or loan company; and, as a concrete example, I want to briefly tell you how it has worked out with the Shakespeare Company, where it has been in operation for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On January 5, 1926, seven employees of the Shakespeare Company petitioned and were granted a charter by the state banking department to organize an Employees Credit Union. The purpose of this organization is to receive the savings of its members and loan the accumulated sums to individual members of the group at a low interest rate; which, of course, constitutes them not only borrowers, but lenders. Jim, when he becomes a borrower, pays Jack interest on his savings, but at the same time he is receiving interest on his savings when Jack and Henry and Tom become borrowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first year the membership (really the stockholders) grew from the original seven to 235. Eighty-five loans were made, amounting to $9,440.50, and the interest paid on these loans was $219.19. The rate of interest charged was 5 percent discount. On regular savings deposits and Christmas Clubs 4 percent interest was paid on monthly balances, and the stockholders earned on their shares 7.47 percent. The total savings of the stockholder members was $6,185.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next year the total loans, made to 227 members, was $16,664.00, with the interest rate the same as the previous year. On account of the increased turnovers the stockholders earned 8.04 percent on their shares, instead of 7.47 percent earned the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next year substantial gains were again made, so that at the beginning of the year 1929 the rate of interest to the borrowers was reduced from 5 percent discount to 4j percent discount. Notwithstanding this substantial reduction in the interest rate, the stockholders had an earning on their capital which amounted to 9.5 percent for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then, remarkable as it may- seem, at the beginning of 1930 the stockholders decided to reduce the borrowers’ rate of interest again, and actually lowered it to 4 percent discount, which rate is quite sufficient to pay dividends to the stockholders of 7 percent and leave a substantial sum in reserves. The total assets or savings of the members now amount to $16,200.00. Even with the lower rate of interest, the financial statement for the first quarter of this year shows a fine gain in capital and profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a commentary! and what possibilities of honest-to-goodness mutual cooperation there are through this wonderful Credit Union plan, which not only makes borrowing and paying of loans easy and inexpensive, but makes a liberal return on the savings and investment of the members!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One remarkable fact is that the members of the Credit Union believe from their own experience that they save three times as much as they would have saved if they had not had this convenient weekly depository for their money, which they know and realize will be of such real benefit to their fellow workers who need to borrow for their emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So enthusiastic are the Shakespeare Company employees over the wonderful good that the Credit Union can do, they are willing to help any group establish a Credit Union and will be glad to instruct and advise and help to carry through the simple procedure necessary to organize and get under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An Indictment of Capitalism</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">AYS Reverend Melvin Abson, rector of St. Stephen’s Episcopal church, Buffalo:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The capitalistic standard of value is, ‘Does it pay?’ It does not recognize any spiritual values. Its primary motive is material gain. Therefore the capitalistic ideal of society is materialistic and diverts man from the practice in his daily life of the spiritual principles that finally determine his eternal destiny. Capitalism has no place for a handicapped man or woman beyond a certain age, and even young men are rejected in some establishments if they fail to pass a medical test equal to that required in the army or navy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Enameled Planes Go Faster</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6"> PAINT manufacturer makes the interesting statement that planes which are finished with a glossy surface have an air speed of ten miles an hour in excess of that of others.</span></p>

Saddlemire, of New York, propounds a long list of questions, each beginning with the words “How many of the American people know that... We give some extracts from what he has written, as, in the main, we agree with his suggested conclusions. The reason for all the centralizations, consolidations and mergers of our day is that Satan is preparing his forces for the last great struggle of earth's history.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Wall Street and the Power Trust are behind the move to centralize and consolidate the public schools of America, and that combine is dictating what shall be taught in the schools, buying up newspapers, teachers, lawyers, judges, courts, and lawmakers, in the effort to control the minds and liberties of the downtrodden masses. They own and control the n e w s-papers, news agencies, and telegraph c o m-panies, and dominate the United States government, which is the biggest reason why the government will do next to nothing in behalf of the suffering masses. They seek to tighten the shackles still more. The government is run by men who are behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergymen of the denominational church systems work hand in hand with Wall Street and the Power Trust in fastening the fetters of tyranny, oppression and injustice upon the arms of the common people. The preachers are the secret allies of the militarists, financiers, politicians, and the Devil. They love wealth and office more than they love the Lord and the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The previous occupant of the White House made the statement concerning the people who elected him to office that they are not qualified to govern themselves and need to be told by those who are “competent” how they should be governed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Wilson was running for reelection, in 1916, Wall Street had already planned to put the United States in the World War regardless of how the presidential election turned out, and had set the very day when war was to be declared. All this was done without the knowledge or consent of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do the American people control the United States government? Do they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following statements circulated during the Avar were gross lies: That Germany and the kaiser started the Avar. That the war was fought to make the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">av</span><span class="font6">orid safe for democracy. That Germany violated Belgium’s neutrality. That the German soldiers were violating all the women of Belgium and northern France. That the Germans were boiling down the bodies of their dead to recover the fat. That they were keeping their prisoners in whitewashed rooms so as to make them blind. That the Germans were the first to make air raids on the cities of their enemies, etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whereas the United States government issued the statement that the battleship Maine was sunk in 1898 by a Spanish mine, yet in fact neither Spain nor Cuba were using mines in their warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham Lincoln refused to have anything to do with the church systems and preachers of his day because they taught the devilish doctrine of eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The preachers throughout the country, both in the North and in the South, opposed Abraham Lincoln when he ran for president, and called him all the names they could think of, including such names as “The Illinois Baboon”, “The Long-faced Scoundrel,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the Interchurch World Movement of several years ago the preachers issued large posters picturing Abraham Lincoln dressed in clerical garments and bearing the words, “Abraham Lincoln said, ‘God Bless the Churches.’ ” What he did say was that if he could find one church that did not subscribe to the doctrine of eternal torment he would join that church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The practice of vaccination violates the Constitution of the United States, which declares that every person in this land shall be secure in his or her rights and person; and therefore all provaceination laws are unconstitutional and nonenforceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tuberculin-bovine testing of cattle, and the seizure and confiscation of cattle by this means-, are a violation of the Constitution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Municipal Employees in Jersey City Disobey Law </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IT </span><span class="font6">IS news to some people that municipal employees have to obey the law, but that is the fact. Here is a squib in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> that “employees of the Jersey City Health Department distributed circulars throughout the city suggesting precautions that should be taken” about food poisonings (probably caused by the use of aluminum cooking utensils). One of Jehovah’s witnesses suggests that there is “something wrong with an ordinance that permits you to warn the people about a bellyache and arrests you for warning them about the world’s greatest disaster”. (The reference is to Judge Rutherford's statement, ‘Present-day fulfilments of Bible prophecy make it certain that world disaster greater than the Deluge is near and unavoidable. The rapid march of events urges upon all to </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">flee now.’</span><span class="font6"> Distribution of the announcement of which this is a part caused some arrests in Jersey City.) Either the municipal employees who disobeyed the law should be locked up or Jehovah’s witnesses be let to do their lawful -work undisturbed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Kidding His Teacher Brother</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">omer Rogers, Florida, has a loyal brother in Ohio who teaches for a living and raises a few pigs on the side, to help out with the expenses. Homer wrote him the following letter, and while, of course, we could not believe that one brother would josh another, yet it almost seems as if Homer had done it in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were very much interested in your recent letter which related some of your recent experiences with your hogs under the new governmental arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You mention having sold some pigs weighing over 100 pounds for $2.75 apiece. Also, that several years ago, during the war, you sold 100-pound pigs for over $22.00 apiece. You will pardon me if I make a few comments on the absurdity of such a situation. Has pork lost six-sevenths of its food value since the war ? Or will a pound of pork go only one-seventh as far in 1934 as it did in 1917? Possibly your ability to produce pork has so increased that you can now produce seven times as much pork with the same feed and effort as in 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you got a long price for such pigs during the war, and a short price for them now, it shows that you have just got around to the other side of the circle. Things move in circles, so they say; that is, going nowhere; and from all indications we are about there. Even this has its bright side, though. When hogs can be bought for less than three cents per pound, and butterfat for ten cents per pound, it shows that the consumer’s dollar goes a long way in the purchase of the necessities of life; and as we are all consumers, we are all prosperous ; so prosperity has arrived. Doesn’t that sound like 1934 intelligence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is on a par with many other absurdities. They tell me that in trying to plow up growing cotton here in the south to keep it off the market, their greatest trouble was to get the mule to walk so the plow would be on the row. He had been trained all his life to keep off the row. Apparently the mule is sane and the w’hite man is off his nut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, about the old sow which you purchased some time ago as an investment for eight dollars and now find the price has dropped so that you cannot get five dollars for her today, you should be proud of the fact that you are able to stand the loss. You may have paid too much for her, but that makes good times for the other fellow. However, you are a good, loyal citizen of the good old U.S.A., and will wish to abide by all patriotic requirements. You will understand that hog birth control is now in order and that the sow must not have pigs. Will Rogers says Uncle Sam is trying to teach the farmers corn control, and the hogs birth control, and one seems about as dumb as the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have been thinking over the various angles of this sow problem quite a bit. No doubt, if you can carry her over a year or two, until the price goes up, you might get back what you paid for her. Sell on a rising market, you see. Or, you might let her have pigs and then kill the pigs as an evidence of your loyalty and devotion to your country. If you voted for Roosevelt, then you will be backing up your judgment. If you voted for Hoover, just remember that, had he been elected, hogs would be more plentiful and the price lower, hence less profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be that you will decide to butcher the sow as the best way out. In this way, you will no longer have to pay tax on her for the privilege of owning her. All you will have to do is to get a butcher’s license, pay the process tax, which will amount to not more than one-third of her value (low value helps you here), and take out a permit to market the meat, provided you can find a market. If not, then don’t take out the permit, and have this saving in your pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, you will pay NRA wages for the help required in butchering, and I figure three good strong men could handle her. If it requires you to dismiss your school for a day, the pupils will enjoy the vacation and you can make it right with the members of the school board by passing out some liver to them. On second thought, though, I believe you cannot give meat away without paying a special tax. However, that would be only one more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember that neighbor of yours who once paid you two cents for a pig’s ears so he could feed them to his dog? You might find this a good market for the ears. He might pay a premium for sow’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another suggestion comes to my mind. If you will keep her over until next season, you can use this as the basis for requesting the privilege of increasing your corn acreage. With that, even after you have plowed up the portion assigned you to keep down overproduction, you will still have more left than you would have had otherwise. This increase is based on consumer-consumption. Then, in case the corn is produced at a loss instead of a profit, the old sow can consume the loss. If hogs have dropped to a new low level by that time, the loss on the corn will offset the drop in price and thus maintain the agricultural equilibrium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If I have had some levity at your expense, it is simply because I have been trying to apply modern logic to your problem. You have stated your problem, and here is the answer. Send on some more; I mean problems, not hogs. I’m glad you can always take a joke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As ever, your brother,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BIRTH OF CHRIST CELEBRATED IN MANY NATIONS SHOW BOARDS FROM CRADLE IN ROME BROADCAST BELLS OF BETHLEHEM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By Thomas B. Morgan, United Press Staff Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome, Dec. 24.—The annual solemn display of the five wooden boards which tradition says formed part of the original cradle of Christ took place today in the Rome Basilica of St. Mary Major. Thousands of children, accompanied by their relatives, passed through the church in a ceremony which is one of the most characteristic at Christmastime here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The relic was shown in one of the chapels of the basilica, and all the afternoon and early evening crowds of wide-eyed Roman children filed past the wooden boards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another curious and characteristic sight was witnessed in the old church of Ara Coeli, near the Capitol. This was children’s sermons. After the celebration of the last mass, little boys and girls, dressed in party clothes, stood up on chairs or other improvised pulpits in the church and delivered short sermons lasting five minutes or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another side of the children’s Christmas Eve here was the large number of cribs or “presepi”, as they are called, artistic representations of the birth of Christ in the stable of Bethlehem, prepared in many churches in side altars, or in specifically constructed alcoves. Some of the cribs showed life-size figures of the holy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands heard midnight mass in the various churches, and then followed the so-called “cenone”, or big supper, when a hearty meal, washed down with Roman wine, was partaken of in countless homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the location of this spectacle, as well as by the mention of certain “saints”, etc., all necessary to his business, we infer that this show was produced by Ambrose Ratti, the Italian gent in the white lace nightie, who runs the Virgin Mary Stock Company, playing burlesque exclusively. Though the stage properties of Mr. Ratti’s company are of a simple nature, being mostly bones and sticks, yet they seem to carry about them an air of genuineness which causes the audience to bite the same hook repeatedly. Of course, we know that the proprietor, Satan, really runs the show from behind the scenes. This same Satan, being blinded by his own conceit, and Mr. Ratti, no doubt being annoyed by continually stumbling in the long lace nightie, have seemingly overlooked some slight anachronisms and inconsistencies in the presentation of this above-noted show. We beg to bring them to attention herewith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus Christ never slept in a cradle, never even saw one, for cradles were unknown until about the year 1140, when first authentic mention of them is made by a Dutch historian. To credit Christ with a cradle is a more glaring anachronism than putting balloon tires on the fiery chariot which came for Elijah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The newspaper commentator, with unconscious irony, describes the “children’s sermons”, which follow, as “another curious and characteristic sight”. Characteristic, yes: that little children should dress in party clothes, stand on a chair and lisp disjointed jargon, is a fine picture of a clergy who dress themselves in women’s apparel and mumble Latin to their largely illiterate audience. Curious, to think that in this day and age there could still be, and is, a great mass of people who find something to revere or worship in all this revolting chicanery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The third scene of this little drama is no doubt the one anxiously awaited by the people from the commencement of the show: after taking, we presume, a hasty glance at the “presepi”, or holy sideshows, they hear the midnight abomination, and then with appetites stimulated by the sight of a fat priest eating crackers and drinking wine, they rush home and gorge themselves! The next day: coated tongues, terrific hangovers, irritable dispositions, much “holy peace and spiritual uplift”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly, Mr. Ratti and the Holy Virgin Stock Company, Burlesque Exclusively, with their bones of saints, boards of “cradles”, choruses of men dressed like women, and women dressed like the musty relics of a forgotten age, put on a show that for sham, vulgarity, length, and profit, places old P. T. Barnum ’way down the list as a pitiful amateur!</span></p>

In a radio address at Vatican City he is quoted as saying: “In every great crisis in history, God has raised up a leader, a deliverer, a savior to restore peace, establish order and save the nation.

<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>A Symposium on Herbs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font6">ERBAL remedies are undoubtedly one of Jehovah’s provisions for restoring or maintaining the health of His human creatures. Inorganic medicines are poor substitutes for herbs in the cure of disease, inasmuch as inorganic substances, while they may set up a reaction in the system, act as irritants rather than as stimulants and cleansers, and must be eliminated, because the human organism cannot assimilate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Articles on the subject of herbal remedies, particularly those contributed by Dr. E. F. Powell, of England, and Mr. Jos. E. Meyer, of the Indiana Botanical Gardens, Hammond, Ind., have been much appreciated by our readers, and it has been urged that we reprint these articles. As they have much in common, and we cannot spare the space to carry both of them, we have decided to combine the articles and give herewith the outstanding points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By way of introduction to his article, Dr. Powell emphasizes the importance of right living, clean thinking and proper eating. He stresses the necessity of eating natural foods, and favors the elimination from the diet of most if not all flesh foods. Beans, potatoes, tubers, such as turnips, parsnips, etc., make substantial substitutes for meats. Massage and spinal adjustment (chiropractic) are also considered of value in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Health is in large measure dependent upon proper eating; and since it is easy to err in the matter of diet, occasional or chronic illness is the rule rather than the exception. Herbal remedies are not a substitute for proper eating and right living, but they will aid the individual to pass through certain sieges of illness and disease. Under present imperfect conditions, and until the beneficent provisions of Jehovah’s kingdom of righteousness are made available to all men, it is safe to say that few escape an occasional spell of sickness. The best that most people can expect is a reasonable degree of health and strength. Some are born with less vitality and innate health than others, and such find it necessary to exercise particular care to take something to give them a lift now and then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is where herbal remedies come in, helping us out when through ignorance, carelessness or misfortune we have become ill.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Important Points</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Meyer stresses the point that herbal remedies lose their strength with age and should therefore be used as fresh as possible. No doubt last year’s stock is better than none at all, but this year's gathering is better. Drugstores often carry old stock or sell tinctures, which have only part of the strength of the fresh herb. It is advisable to keep the herbs in airtight containers. Some lose their strength more quickly than others. Reliable herbalists are found in many of the larger cities, and you can be reasonably sure of getting this year’s stock from them. Of course, if you are familiar with herbs, and live where you can do so, you can gather and dry them yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As some herbs are very bitter, licorice root, honey or molasses may be used for sweetening. Dr. Powell specifies old-fashioned black molasses (treacle). All of these sweeteners are harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anemia.</span><span class="font6"> This trouble is due to lack of iron in the blood. Ordinary iron tonics are made of inorganic iron and upset the stomach, cause constipation and discolor the teeth. Yellow dock root is a good herbal medicine. It may be combined with bogbean and comfrey leaves. An ounce each of the three ingredients simmered in a quart of water, cooled, strained and bottled, will make enough for several days. Take a wineglassful every four hours, or twenty minutes before breakfast, dinner and supper, and shortly before retiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Appendicitis.</span><span class="font6"> Take one ounce each of elder blossom, peppermint and yarrow and simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Sweeten with old-fashioned black treacle (molasses), and take a wineglassful every fifteen minutes until relieved. It must be taken hot every time, and must be continued, sometimes for twenty-four hours. Do not be afraid of the perspiration caused, or if you vomit. You will be better off with an empty stomach. Use the leaves loft over from each infusion to make a hot compress to cover the abdomen. Nothing should be eaten until a cure is brought about, which is usually certain, even in severe cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Appetite.</span><span class="font6"> For loss of appetite the root of the blue or American gentian is of value, to which the same amount of licorice root is added for sweetening. Place a teaspoonful of the herb in a cup of boiling water and drink when cool, a large mouthful at a time. Two ounces of the gentian placed in a gallon of any sweet wine make an excellent tonic. Gentian bitters are</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">made by adding two to four ounces to a gallon of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Asthma.</span><span class="font6"> For this Dr. Powell prescribes vervain, horehound and elecampane, an ounce each, prepared and taken in the following manner: Simmer the herbs in three pints of boiling water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful every four hours. Reduce sugars and starchy foods in the diet. The same remedy is good for bronchitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Meyer recommends wild plum bark, a heaping teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water. Drink cool, during the day, a large mouthful at a time. The inner bark is used, cut into small pieces. It is gathered just before the flowers open. The yellow dock root, made into a tea, is also beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bladder Trouble.</span><span class="font6"> Horsetail grass, or scouring rush, rich in organic minerals, especially lime, is useful for kidney and bladder troubles, especially in cases of gravel. Steep a teaspoonful of the plant in a cup of boiling water and drink one or two cupfuls in the course of the day, cold, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cancer.</span><span class="font6"> Vegetarians do not have cancer. It is rare among the Jews, whose flesh foods are carefully inspected. A natural diet has been known to cure cancer. A remedy that has cured many severe cases is made of violet leaves, yellow dock and red clover tops. Simmer one ounce of each in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Strain and take a wineglassful every four hours. For external sores make a poultice of the used herbs and apply fresh night and morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catarrh.</span><span class="font6"> Cut down the use of sugar and starch foods, and include an abundance of green, leafy vegetables in the diet. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in a tumblerful of warm water. Add ten to twenty drops of compound tincture of myrrh, and sniff up the nose until the solution returns through the mouth. Do this morning and evening oroftener. Pleurisy root is another remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Colds and chills.</span><span class="font6"> A tea made of elder blossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger is an effective remedy. Drink as much as you comfortably can, upon going to bed, and put a hot water bottle to the feet and sweat the cause of the trouble away. Repeat within a few hours, if necessary. Don’t feed a cold; if you do you will soon have to starve a fever. Pleurisy root, taken as a tea, also promotes perspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Constipation.</span><span class="font6"> Watch the diet. Eat more fruit and avoid white bread, condiments and sloppy puddings. Eat natural food that requires thorough chewing. A tea made of equal parts of senna leaves and mountain flax may be used as a remedy. Vary the quantity to suit the need, and reduce gradually. Butternut bark is a fine laxative for older folks. The inner bark of the root is used, which becomes brown upon exposure to air. It does not gripe. Equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, licorice and senna may be added. The directions for making this or any tea are the same: One or two heaping teaspoonfuls in a cup of boiling water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consumption.</span><span class="font6"> Fresh air and fresh fruits and vegetables in abundance are important. Do not take more than three eggs per week. Use no vinegar or condiments. Eat as much watercress as possible. A marvelous herbal medicine is composed of one-half ounce each of marshmallow root, golden seal and pleurisy root, and an ounce each of linseed, Iceland moss and licorice root, simmer thirty minutes in five pints of water, stirring continually. Strain and add a pound of best black treacle (molasses). Let cool and take </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> wineglassful every tw<sup>T</sup>o hours in severe cases, less frequently in milder cases. This remedy is also good for coughs and for debility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diarrhea.</span><span class="font6"> Raspberry leaves and bayberry bark, half an ounce each, simmered in one and a half pints of water for twenty minutes, and taken cold, is helpful. Add cinnamon if desired. Take a wineglassful every two or three hours. An infusion of slippery elm, a heaping teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water, is also a wonderful help in cases of diarrhea, as well as in dysentery and bronchitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diphtheria.</span><span class="font6"> Simmer one ounce of red sage in one and a half pints of water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful as frequently as the case demands. The patient should drink plenty of diluted lemon juice, and touch no food until w’ell on the road to recovery. Gargle with the sage tea occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dropsy.</span><span class="font6"> A tea made from the bark of the ■wahoo bush root is useful for the treatment of dropsy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dysentery.</span><span class="font6"> See under </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspepsia.</span><span class="font6"> Keep to natural food, and chew well. Find out what agrees with you, and stick to that. Avoid eating more than two kinds of food at a meal. A short fast has been known to cure certain cases, or an exclusive diet of wholemeal biscuit for a week or two. Wahoo bark tea is highly recommended for dyspepsia. It is an excellent tonic, laxative and alterative. The bark of the root is used, steeped in hot water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Epilepsy.</span><span class="font6"> Eat no meat, but plenty of vegetables and fruits, and especially onions. Instead of eating supper, take a cup of bran tea. The following remedy is beneficial: One ounce each of valerian root, vervain, wood betony and skullcap, simmered in four pints of water, twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful every four hours. This remedy, particularly the blue vervain, is also good for fits and falling sickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Female Complaints.</span><span class="font6"> A tea made of equal parts of horehound and raspberry leaves will remove obstructions and tend to produce the normal. This remedy is harmless, and may be taken freely. It is especially beneficial in cases of pregnancy, and promotes easy birth in most cases, if taken freely (about a pint a day) in wineglassful doses for three or four months preceding the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Goiter.</span><span class="font6"> Irish moss has been used extensively for goiter, as this is due to a deficiency of iodine. Irish moss contains organic iodine in a form that is easily assimilated. It is harmless. Its taste is its only objection. About the best way to use it is to place a teaspoonful in a plate of soup, broth or milk. Boil the drinking water and watch the diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Headaches.</span><span class="font6"> Treat as for epilepsy, if the cause is in the nerves. If the trouble is due to stomach derangements, take the remedy suggested for liver trouble and watch your diet. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspepsia.)</span><span class="font6"> Worry is responsible for headaches in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Heart Trouble.</span><span class="font6"> The stomach is often responsible for what appears to be heart trouble. Motherwort, gentian root and skullcap, one ounce each, simmered twenty minutes in three pints of water and strained, may be taken, a wineglassful every four hours. If you eat meat it should be boiled; flesh with the blood in it is bad for the heart, as well as being objectionable in other ways. Jehovah instructed the Israelites to eat no meat with the blood in it. The blood left in the veins of a dead animal is full of uric acid and other toxins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Plenty of fresh air is important. Chiropractic or osteopathy is of benefit in many cases. Walking and light exercises are valuable, but not to the point of fatigue. Leave off at the first signs of fatigue or palpitation. Do not smoke, and use no alcoholic drinks. Do not drink with your meals or too soon thereafter. Wait about half an hour and then drink moderately. Be careful in sex matters, as excesses are often the cause of heart trouble. Many cases can be cured or greatly improved by following these simple instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Incontinence of Urine (Bedwetting).</span><span class="font6"> Yarrow is used for this trouble. Parents should never punish children for inability to hold their urine, at night or during the day. The tea is prepared by steeping a teaspoonful of the herb, cut small or granulated, in a cup of boiling water. Drink the cupful, cold, during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Inflammations.</span><span class="font6"> For inflammation in any part of the body the remedy is elder blossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger tea. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Appendicitis.)</span><span class="font6"> This wonderful remedy will save life at the eleventh hour, says Dr. Powell. And it is absolutely harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Influenza.</span><span class="font6"> The same as for colds and chills. A cure is said to be certain, even in the most serious circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kidney Trouble.</span><span class="font6"> Pay attention to diet; take plenty of exercise; drink plenty of diluted lemon juice. An ounce each of buchu leaves, parsley and juniper berries, simmered in three pints of water for twenty minutes, should be pressed and strained and taken in wineglassful doses every four hours, or more frequently if necessary. Osteopathic treatments are sometimes advisable. Cold water packs applied nightly over the small of the back are helpful; also steam baths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sluggish Liver.</span><span class="font6"> Diet as for dyspepsia, and take a wineglassful of the following remedy every four hours, or, in severe cases, every hour. Half an ounce each of horehound, agrimony, crushed ginger, gentian, simmered in two and a half pints of water for twenty minutes. Cold or tepid friction baths each morning are good. Steam baths are beneficial in severe cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another remedy is mandrake root, black root, colic root and sacred bark. Mix an ounce of each, and boil a teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of water for one minute. Strain, cool, and take from cup or wineglass as in other cases. One or two days’ treatment is usually sufficient. The remedy is bitter, and may be sweetened as suggested in the introduction to this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lumbago.</span><span class="font6"> Queen of the meadow root is the thing for lumbago. Prepare in the usual way, and take in wineglassful doses or large mouthfuls, using about a cupful in the course of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lungs.</span><span class="font6"> Coltsfoot tea is most beneficial, and is widely used in cases of bronchitis, asthma, coughs, colds, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nerves.</span><span class="font6"> Pay attention to your diet. (See under </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspepsia.)</span><span class="font6"> Use medicine mentioned under </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Epilepsy.</span><span class="font6"> A cheerful mind is important. (See Proverbs 17:22.) Sexual excesses must be avoided. A cold friction bath every morning is strongly recommended. Pure olive oil is also very good; take a tablespoonful each morning, or dress your salads with it. Onions are also of value, and should be used freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kola nuts are a fine nervine and tonic. They may be taken in the powdered form, a teaspoonful or two before breakfast, salted to taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Black cohosh is also good for the nervous person. A tea made of equal parts of black cohosh, sacred bark and Canada snakeroot is used for nervous headaches or nervous prostration and many other nervous afflictions of the female organism. A teaspoonful of the root to a cup of boiling water, taken during the course of the day, is the average dose. If the tea is made too strong it may bring on a headache, but it is harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Neuralgia.</span><span class="font6"> For this affliction black cohosh is recommended. (See under </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nerves.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Obesity.</span><span class="font6"> Sea wrack has been used for ages by fat people who wanted to reduce. It is also called gulf wrack and bladder wrack. The average dose is one teaspoonful three times a day, taken in coffee or as it is. While sea wrack is the most harmless and best remedy for obesity, it will not affect everyone in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Piles.</span><span class="font6"> Treat as for constipation. A good herbal ointment will be helpful, but the cure must come through a correction of the cause. Improve the bowel action and the blood by proper dieting, and the trouble will disappear. Tea made of white oak bark and fennel seed in equal parts is another remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pimples</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eruptions.</span><span class="font6"> The leaves and twigs of sweet fern brewed into a strong tea, used both as a drink and as an external wash, will clear up an unsightly and pimply skin. Drink a cupful a day in large mouthfuls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pneumonia.</span><span class="font6"> The same as for colds and chills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rheumatism.</span><span class="font6"> Adopt a vegetarian diet and eat plenty of greens. Avoid tea, coffee, cocoa and condiments. Use bran tea and unsweetened lemonade instead. Simmer the following in two quarts of water: One ounce each of bogbean, centaury, yarrow and yellow dock, and a dozen cayenne pods. Rub compound tincture of myrrh into the painful parts morning and evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Virginia snakeroot is another remedy for this affliction. Place a teaspoonful of the granulated or powdered root in a glass container, pour in boiling water, allow to stand until cool, strain, and drink a cupful a day, a mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Black cohosh, prickly ash, burdock and pokeroot, is also used for rheumatism, prepared in the following way: Mix equal parts of these herbs, and place a teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rickets.</span><span class="font6"> Plenty of orange juice and grapes should be given to children having this trouble. As they grow older include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet. Onions are excellent, as well as whole-wheat bread and fresh dairy butter. Very young children may be given vegetable juices or liquids drained from cooked vegetables, particularly if orange juice cannot be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A good medicine is made by simmering half an ounce each of wild tansy and agrimony in a pint of water for fifteen minutes. Strain and sweeten with molasses or honey, or with licorice root. Give young children a tablespoonful four times a day; older children more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sleepilessness.</span><span class="font6"> Blue skullcap, catnip and peppermint mixed together and used, one or two heaping teaspoonfuls to a cup of boiling water, make a good nervine and sedative. Drink a cupful warm just before you go to bed and you will not be bothered with wakefulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another remedy is made of valerian root, vervain, wood betony and skullcap, one ounce each simmered in four pints of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stomach Trouble.</span><span class="font6"> Juniper-berry oil is an excellent stomach tonic. A handful of the berries themselves placed in a gallon of any kind of wine makes a fine stomach tonic. (See also under </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspepsia.)</span><span class="font6"> Eliminate the cause of the trouble by eating properly. In cases of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sour stomach</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gas,</span><span class="font6"> sweet flag is very beneficial. Two ounces of sweet flag root, one ounce black cohosh, one ounce sassafras bark; mix together and place a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of water, bring to boiling point, and drink cool, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tonic.</span><span class="font6"> Mix equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, butternut bark and marshmallow root and place a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of boiling water. Strain, cool, and drink a cupful, a little at a time, during the day. This drink is slightly laxative and quite harmless. It may be given to children, but is of special value to older people who have poor circulation and take cold easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Worms.</span><span class="font6"> Camomile tea is used to expel worms. It is made like ordinary household tea: Simply steeping a large teaspoonful of the flowers in a cup of boiling water for a half hour. Strain and drink a half cupful, hot or cold, before going to bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wounds.</span><span class="font6"> A dressing of lemon juice, water, and a few drops of compound tincture of myrrh is ideal for all wounds and sores. In nearly all cases this is all that is necessary. There are many good herbal ointments which can be supplied by any reliable herbalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another wash for wounds and ulcers is a tea made from horsetail grass. Just steep a teaspoonful of the dried plant in a cup of boiling water, and use when cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In conclusion we quote the following from the pen of Dr. Otto Raubenhauer, Ph.G., Phar.D., Ph.M.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Herbs are the oldest form of medicine. Hippocrates (460-370 B. C.), the father of medicine, was an herbalist. Botanical medicine is the oldest branch of medicine.... Herbs contain the vital elements (vitamins and organic minerals) which are deficient in the diseased body.... Herbs also promote the elimination of waste matter and poisons from the system by simple natural means. Herbs, when correctly used, assist nature in its fight against disease. Herbs are consequently better suited for the treatment of disease than chemicals and other substances foreign to the human body. Therefore use herbs!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mwanalesa and the Missionaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">T IS nine years since Mwanalesa, of Central Africa, fixed it up with another native politician and drowned 22 of the latter’s enemies while pretending to baptize them; subsequently he w<sup>T</sup>as instrumental in killing 156 others. Though the missionaries know better, it suits them well to use the name “Watch Tower” in connection with this murderer; they know that he had no connection with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. As a matter of fact he was a Roman Catholic, and when he was led forth to his public execution a venerable Roman Catholic priest, with a flowing white beard, holding a crucifix, led the procession; but as long as the present batch of missionaries in Central Africa live they will find it convenient, from time to time, to malign the truth because of this man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Propaganda Keeps Millions Ill</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Two Parts—Part 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font8">INNESOTA comes next on our list. Doctors got in the habit of exploring J. N. Peterson, of Minnesota, for cancer, but after abstaining from aluminum ware for two and a half years he had a complete recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. C. Walker, of Minnesota, killed two dogs by feeding them in an aluminum pan, and came mighty near getting rid of her hubby by the same method. For six years he was forced to bed by dizziness, headache and vomiting after a few hours’ work, and could take only raw eggs and fresh milk right from the cows. Now he works sixteen hours a day, and Mrs. Walker has no idea when, if ever, she is going to be able to collect the insurance on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Agnes L. Brown, of Minnesota, suffered with stomach trouble, constipation, headaches, sore mouth, sore throat and heart trouble, dizziness and loss of sight. The children had heart attacks and sore mouths; the husband had trouble with heart, stomach, kidneys and head. All these troubles ended with the disuse of aluminum utensils, but since then a single meal at the home of a friend brought Mrs. Brown headaches, shortness of breath, soreness of tongue and a miserable feeling all over. She noticed that the major portion of the meal was cooked in aluminum. Mrs. Brown had a dear old lady friend who laughed at the idea that aluminum utensils, alum baking powder and white flour could do her any harm; she died of cancer, self-induced. Her son noticed that his baby was getting sores externally and refused to eat. Mrs. Brown told him aluminum utensils were killing his child. He went home, smashed the whole set with an axe, got enamel ware instead, and the whole family got well. She knew of a case where a ham boiled, but not cooled, in an aluminum kettle, made ill every person who ate of it. She says that the alum used to soften the city drinking water of Virginia, Minnesota, is a big help to the M.D.’s and undertakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A. L. Dosh, of Minnesota, had in his family a patient suffering with what appeared to be tumors of the breast for over seven years; they were of the size of a large pea, and almost black. Before breaking they became very painful, and the pain spread throughout the body. Six weeks after dumping the aluminum ware the last of these tumors disappeared, and there has not been the slightest return of the trouble; also, a stomach and bowel trouble which was very threatening passed away, and the patient is regaining health. Another member of the family was cured of ulcers and bad skin eruptions by the same means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Missouri Wholesale Poisonings</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Missouri believes in doing things on a generous and noble scale. At the General Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, 325 employees were made ill. It is the boast of the aluminum ware makers that they have their wares in every hospital. The results seem to show that this boast is true; and when you come to think of it, that it is the business of a hospital to make people sick, and to keep them sick, it is not such a bad here-and-now edition of the purgatory scheme. Every business today is run for revenue only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Times</span><span class="font8"> advertises “A New Tuna, Luxury Brand, Packed in Aluminum Can, New, Delicious”. We anxiously await reports of results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. J. R. Griffith, of Missouri, noticed that when her dog Tim was fed from an aluminum dish he always left some on the sides and bottom, but when fed from an enamel dish he licked up every particle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">G. A. Bauer, of Missouri, had a skin cancer which, it was explained to him, he could have removed for $50. He stopped eating food cooked</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">in aluminum ware; the “cancer” dried up, and he brushed it off with his fingers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. N. Ragan, of Missouri, warmed and drank one morning coffee that had been left in an aluminum percolator the previous morning; as a result he was nearly blind for nine months, until the aluminum worked out of his system. Two eye specialists consulted were unable to understand the case or to help in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">E. M. Moore, of Missouri, entertained for a Sunday meal, noticed that it was all cooked in aluminum, and laughingly thought to himself he ought now to get some results. He did: Monday he was ill; Tuesday his back was very lame; Wednesday he was practically helpless from severe pains and soreness in his kidneys; after tw<sup>7</sup>o weeks they were still sore. The pain was inside, not outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. F. AV. Robinson, of Missouri, writes that since discontinuing the use of aluminum ware her husband's hands have become soft as velvet; for years they were covered with a thick gray crust of a grimy color; deep cracks came which would heal and crack again. One physician was honest enough to say he did not know what it was; another said it was tetter; another said old men were subject to it; and the fourth and last told him he must keep his hands out of water. A neighbor who kept hot soup constantly bubbling on the back of the stove in an aluminum kettle nearly killed himself before he found out the cause of his trouble. His liver was so enlarged he could hardly lie down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Galena, Missouri, in the family of Richard Crabtree, some chicken was kept overnight in an aluminum pan. Two of Mr. Crabtree’s children, a boy of one year and another boy of four years, died and were buried in the same grave. This was all regular; nothing unusual about it in any way. The deaths could have been forecast by any reader of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> as a most natural result.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Natal, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Chaim Weizmann, his wife and thirty others, were poisoned at a dinner given in Dr. Weizmann’s honor in Durban, Natal, South Africa. It was a regular, formal, up-to-date poisoning; no unusual features of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Verdel, Nebraska, the wife of Fila Sherman, his seventeen-year-old daughter Vivian and his thirteen-year-old daughter Esther died within a week after they had eaten corn prepared in an aluminum pan; very sad, but quite to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. F. AV. Morse, of New Hampshire, writes that when she ceased to use aluminum ware she ceased to have stomach trouble; she is quite sure it was these utensils that caused her to have a skin cancer, now also healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the Overbrook Hospital for the Insane, Newark, N. J., after a Christmas dinner, out of 280 guests all but 50 were taken ill within two hours after the feast. There was nothing the matter with the food itself. The answer is so plain that anybody can understand it. The aluminum utensil people boast that nearly all the hospitals in the country cook their food in nothing but aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Matilda R. AVellman, of New Jersey, writes that her dog died of cancer of the rectum; his drinking pan was of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>New York Wholesale Poisonings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">If the smaller, less important states can have wholesale poisonings, they are not to be denied to the Empire State. There was one at White Plains, where G5 persons became desperately ill, and another at Jamaica Hospital, Richmond Hill, New York, where 60 were stricken; everything regular. The “health authorities” never know any reasons for these wholesale poisonings, and never will know any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would seem as if the opinions of Dr. Hal Truman Beans, of Columbia University, New York city; Doctor N. S. Hanoka, of New York city; Doctor Frank C. Gephart, chemist, New York; Andrew Dingwall, Ph.D., chemist, Brooklyn; Lester C. Himebaugh, biochemist, New York; Max Kahn, associate in biological chemistry, Columbia University; John Allen Killian, professor of chemistry, Fordham Medical School, New York; Dr. Matthew Steele, Ph.D., instructor at Columbia University; Dr. AVilliam J. Gies, professor of biological chemistry, Columbia University; Dr. Hattie L. Hoeft, physiological chemist, Teachers College of Columbia University, ought to have some weight, but apparently their well-considered advice that aluminum compounds, when taken internally by man, are poisonous, has not registered as it should. Even though most of them may not wish it, we are helping to get their ideas before the people, as a public duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Royal S. Copeland, United States senator from New York, and former commissioner of health of New York city, states that food should not be allowed to remain overnight or for any period of time in aluminum cookingware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E. </span><span class="font8">W. Symondson, of New York, lost his mother, presumably by operation for cancer; he is now well convinced she would be alive today had she never had any aluminum utensils. When he notices people who look ill, and inquires, he often finds they cook by what may be called “the great graveyard way”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buffalo Boy Scout Troop 66 left some onions piled on aluminum dishes used by the troops, and they were overlooked; in a few months the dishes were still more useless than ever, as they were pitted with holes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Miss Edith Hollenbeck, of New York, had vomiting spells three or four times a week; the doctors said it was cancer; she threw away all her aluminum utensils, and got well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chris Jenson, of New York, became entirely incapacitated for work as a result of the habit of using for drinking and cooking purposes water left in an aluminum kettle, but his palpitation of the heart and fainting spells all disappeared within a year after he threw the aluminum ware away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Clayton J. Woodworth, of New York, tilted an aluminum skillet in a gas flame; the skillet took fire and fell in pieces; as the aluminum hydroxides, sulphates and chlorides had worked out into the food, their place had been taken by the fats used in cooking. An aluminum teakettle was mended several times, due to aluminum hydroxide passing out into the foods and drinks of the family. Pie crust rolled out on a table top of pure aluminum was so gray it could not be eaten. Obviously, a metal unfit for a table top would be a metal unfit for use as a cooking utensil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">0. 0. </span><span class="font8">McIntyre, New York newspaper man, divulged that 900 were poisoned at a bank executive luncheon in New York. Same old story: nothing of this was allowed in the newspapers; it is thought better to risk the lives of a few men such as Mitchell and Morgan than to have aluminum shares go down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Elizabeth Barnes, of New York, made a shampoo in an aluminum basin; immediately after using the shampoo her hair felt like a coil of very fine wire and broke off most unaccountably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. H. V. Champlin writes of the death of her father, after his eating of chicken cooked in aluminum and allowed to stand in it for a few hours; two other members of the family were also made seriously ill. The mother, Mrs. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">C. J. </span><span class="font8">Baker, died from the poison three days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the nine years from 1920 to 1929 cancer rose from twentieth place to second place as a cause of death; it knows no help but the knife, the N-ray and radium. One would think that all doctors would be willing to recommend fresh fruits and vegetables and to cut out white bread, pork and aluminum utensils and see what would happen. They would learn something.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>New Zealand and North Dakota</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. R. Atkinson Reddell, of New Zealand, in a letter to Doctor Betts, states that he has long held the view that the cooking of foods in aluminum ware is destructive to health and was glad when Betts’ book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Poisoning</span><span class="font8"> put scientific information on the subject within his reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Ivy Gillanders, of New Zealand, was very ill with stomach trouble and colitis, but, since ridding her home of every aluminum article in it, now finds herself in greatly improved health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Roe E. Remington, biological chemist, North Dakota Agricultural College, Fargo, North Dakota, found by experimentation that aluminum compounds, when taken internally by man, are precipitated therein, and thus are poisonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Henry W. Haven, of North Dakota, had a sick kitten, and incidentally a sick wife. He made his wife feed the kitten for ten days in something else than aluminum, so the kitten would get well, and then happened to think of his wife and made her feed herself the same way. It was hard on the doctor who had had her as a regular customer for eight years; for she got entirely well. Henry says the only place for aluminum utensils is on the rock pile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ohio Wholesale Poisonings</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ohio is a great state, one of the very greatest in the Union. It claims the same rights as any other great state to allow its citizens to be poisoned wholesale as well as retail. The Toledo Y.W.C.A., famous for its cleanliness, carefully selected chickens, cooked them in aluminum, and allowed them to stand therein from afternoon till eight at night, when they served a banquet to 300 high school young women. The result was regular in every way; 70 of the young women became very ill. Any “medical authority” that would have dared discover the truth on this would have lost his job. There is too much profitable advertising at stake. What is an occasional wholesale poisoning of our finest citizens when we have the reputation and integrity and dividends of our greatest financial institutions at stake?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Elsie Hoppe, of Toledo, boiled beef hearts and tomato soup in an aluminum kettle; the result was regular. She, and four of her children, ill. Mrs. Everett Smith, and daughter Lois, died from home-cooked food, allowed to be stored for some time in aluminum before being packed in glass jars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">W. L. Bryden, of Ohio, suffered from a gnawing sensation in his right side and up the colon to its turn; he thought he had cancer; he discarded his aluminum utensils, and recovered entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. P. D. Pottle, of Ohio, observed that on a hot July day seven goats refused to drink water from an aluminum bucket, but drank eagerly when a different bucket was provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Lawrence Harbauer, of Ohio, told Dr. Betts she had used aluminum ware for years without any ill effects. She died in less than thirty days after she made that remark, and they found in her gall bladder a stone over 1| inches in diameter. Her husband, even after her death, continued the use of the utensils which had ended the life of his companion; shortly thereafter he died from ulcers and cancerous tissue, aluminum-caused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Charles Frazer, of Ohio, cooked the food for goats in aluminum. One of the goats developed bowel trouble; when enamel ware was substituted the goat got well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Louis Cook, of Ohio, bought a set of aluminum ware at a big price. After using for a time she noticed in the kettle a crystal, like salt, touched it with finger tip, and tasted. It was sour, and produced a sore on her tongue that took two weeks to heal. If you want that kind of sores on your intestines, you just go right ahead and use all the aluminum utensils you wish to. Don’t allow anything we may say to stop you. You have a right to die by a selfinduced cancer the same as anybody else, and should be protected in that right; only don’t get sore when somebody tells you about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Arles Pottle, of Ohio, reports a case of a patient with heavy ulceration of the stomach completely healed when the lady discontinued using aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Garnet Pearl Walker, of Ohio, writes of a neighbor girl who had violent vomiting spells for years; she switched over to using granite ware, and the trouble ended completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. I. A. Hall, of Ohio, says her mother broke out with hives, became unconscious, and was so swollen as to be unrecognizable. A physician said it was from her kidneys; another said it was rheumatism and her teeth would have to be extracted (he overlooked the fact that she had worn false teeth for thirty-five years); a third said it was from her liver; a fourth said her tonsils must come out, and he had his wish. The attacks continued nine months, but in sixty days after discarding all aluminum ware she became a well woman. Incidentally, antagonism to the literature of the Kingdom turned into friendliness. All the people need is to have the liars stop lying to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Grace Daugherty, of Ohio, had sore mouth and a sore lip from wearing an aluminum plate and cooking in aluminum ware. These troubles disappeared when the causes were removed. A stomach trouble of long standing also disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mother of L. V. Gates, of Ohio, had violent attacks of gallstones for several years and was told she must be operated upon; but when she stopped using aluminum ware she had no more attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Steubenville, Ohio, it was noted that Tom Parry’s canary will neither chirp, sing nor bathe when given water treated with alum and other chemicals, but bursts into song and bathes birdfashion when given pure spring water. Says Dr, Betts: “Thousands of voices of little children are similarly silenced as reported concerning this canary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One reason why cows occasionally give poisoned milk and children are slain thereby is that the cows eat white snakeroot (in Ohio) or rayless goldenrod (New Mexico) and the excessive amount of aluminum compounds which these contain is more than the human system can handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people of Columbus have 500 tons of bauxite (aluminum-ore compound) thrown into their drinking water every year. It is used to purify (?) the water and help the chemical companies continue to operate at a profit. Iron sulphate should be used instead, and is harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adolph Kurzen, of Ohio, talked with an aluminum worker who said there is a disagreeable and sickening smell from working in aluminum, the fingers become sore, and the worker lives but about ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Charles Howard, managing editor of the 86-page Toledo </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times, was</span><span class="font8"> dismissed within twenty-four hours after he allowed to be printed an article by himself upon the aluminum question, after he had thoroughly investigated the facts. It is dangerous to tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It took the Federal Trade Commission five years, required 158 witnesses and 4,000 pages of closely typewritten testimony to reveal to the Mellon government the facts that are freely revealed to our readers in this issue. As soon as the report was published it was immediately suppressed for reasons which are so self-evident that it is a public shame to even mention them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Oklahoma Has Poisonings Also</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1933, dumped into its water supply 251 tons of alum, undoubtedly affecting the health of thousands. Iron sulphate could have been used instead, with perfect safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Jack McKenzie, of Oklahoma, writes that vomiting spells were killing her boy, but he recovered when she stopped using aluminum-ware utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. H. Barger, of Oklahoma, had a constant pain in his stomach, sharp pains in chest, was very nervous, and lost twenty pounds in weight; tried all kinds of doctors and medicines without result, but obtained complete relief when the aluminum ware was discarded. Now, at meal time, he is hungry, eats all he wants, and feels fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Arthur J. Edens, of Oklahoma, was kept ill by eating food carried in aluminum containers in his lunch kit. After lunch came a nauseating feeling, followed by pains in the stomach. The malady disappeared with the utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">W. V. Stanley, of Oklahoma, was bothered with stomach trouble and heart trouble, was forced to stop on the street and sit down on curbs or in doorways, and could not climb stairs. Not one of these symptoms has appeared since he quit killing himself by small doses of aluminum hydrate taken from his kitchen ware three times a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Tecumseh, Oklahoma, 90 girls were poisoned at the State Home for girls. Everything about this poisoning was regular, including the absence of any explanation by the medical “authorities”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A subscriber in Oklahoma noted a letter from the president of the American Medical Association, deploring the increase in trench mouth. The lady wrote Dr. Fishbein that the cause of trench mouth, which he had admitted he did not comprehend, was that the soldier boys tried to drink from aluminum containers. He replied: “Careful scientific study in various parts of the world indicates not the slightest danger to the human from eating food cooked in aluminum cooking utensils.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under the circumstances one can partly comprehend the following from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Association for Medico-Physical Re* search:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the A.M.A.</span><span class="font7"> is the vilest sheet that passes the United States mail. Its language merely keeps within the Postal Regulations. It is conducted meticulously upon the principles of graft. Nothing new and useful in therapeutics escapes its unqualified condemnation. Its attacks are generally </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ad hominem. </span><span class="font7">Its editorial columns are largely devoted to character assassination. No reputation, no life, no character is above its libelous assaults. It is of such reputation that the statement of a fact in its columns is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">prima facie</span><span class="font7"> evidence of its untruth. Its editorial writers work in the seething ooze of corruption and write with a “muck rake”. This reputation of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the A.M.A.</span><span class="font7"> is general in the United States. Its editor is of the type of Jew that crucified Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ontario and Oregon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Margaret Carson, trained nurse, served twice in the largest hospital in Toronto. Each time she developed cankers in her mouth, due entirely to the fact that at that time the cooking in that hospital was all done in aluminum. Since then the hospital in question has done away with all aluminum utensils. Looks as if, in Canada, the health authorities were willing to learn something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">W. A. Sinclair, of Ontario, writes that a Doctor C., having made a study of aluminum compounds, is warning the people against the use of aluminum for cooking and fully agrees that the position of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> on the subject is correct. He is not generally supported by the medical board of his city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A. S. McKenzie, of Ontario, tells of a surgeon who rejected hot water for the purpose of sterilizing a surgical instrument, when it was brought to him in an aluminum container. He said the contaminated water coming in connection with the blood stream might cause serious trouble. The Pelton and Crane Company, sterilizer manufacturers, made them of aluminum. For some unpublished reason they now make them of stainless steel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. C. R. Fair, of Ontario, had heart trouble and sinking spells, gradually coming closer and closer together; often her husband had to resort to artificial respiration to pull her through. Paying attention to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> she noticed those attacks always came after eating cabbage, rhubarb, spinach or anything that would clean the kettles of their verdigris. She then discarded all aluminum ware, and has not had one spell since. A hardware man to whom she confided admitted that aluminum ware is not fit for anybody to use, and stated that he advises customers never to purchase it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. A. Manning, of Ontario, took a quantity of defibrinated cow's blood, and stirred into it alum (one of the acid salts of aluminum) in hot water, with the surprising result that the blood turned into a solid. He thinks this shows why people are slowly killed after eating meat cooked and allowed to stand in aluminum vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Dudley Ryan, of Ontario, very ill of stomach trouble, threw out all her aluminum, and got well. (She reports a neighbor who had a piece of beef turn green when left in a pot overnight; another churned in an aluminum vessel and the butter turned black; another mixed a white cake batter in an aluminum bowl and a black streak followed the spoon.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Reed College, Portland, Oregon, 75 students were made terribly ill from eating foods cooked in aluminum ware which had remained overnight in the aluminum containers. This poisoning was in every way regular. All possibility of chemical poisoning was eliminated by the state board of health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Aurelia L. Culp, of Oregon, finds that she and her husband are benefited physically, and their minds made more clear, by discontinuing the use of aluminum ware in cooking. Recently for four weeks in a hospital she was able to identify at once the foods which had been cooked in aluminum, noting a slightly bitter taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kate Ronde, of Oregon, writes two remarkable letters, each of which would make two pages of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> We wish we had space to print them. Six years of investigation makes her certain that when she stopped using aluminum she stopped having the flu, and that most flu victims are regular users of Mr. Mellon’s metal. She discovered that five cats refused food that had stood in aluminum containers, and would not taste it even when sugared and creamed, yet they were hungry enough at the same time to eat plain bread. Since discontinuing the use of the metal she has ceased having neuritis, and is no longer always tired out, has no need of laxatives, and misses the palpitation and sharp pains around the heart which were regularly hers before.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Pennsylvania Wholesale Poisonings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Pennsylvania has as able chemists as are to be found anywhere. Prominent among these are H. J. Force, of Scranton, Dr. Clarence A. Smith, of Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Dr. Arnold K. Balls, associate in chemistry, University of Pennsylvania. These men have all borne testimony to the fact that aluminum compounds, when taken internally by man, are poisonous. Those men are honest and they are disinterested. Their advice should be heeded. However, wholesale aluminum poisonings in Pennsylvania go right on, year after year. Eight were poisoned at the Capolozzi wedding at Pittsburgh. Everything about the poisoning was regular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, 200 church diners were poisoned at the First Baptist church, due to the fact that the entire supply of gravy was collected into one aluminum container. When the highly paid advertising experts got on the job they quickly changed the word “aluminum” to “metallic”, so as to throw the public off the track. An advertising man is a useful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At McKeesport, Pennsylvania, soup made of fresh and excellent materials was allowed to stand from 11:30 a.m. to 5: 30 p.m. in a closed aluminum container. When eaten it sent a father, mother and two children to the hospital deathly sick. This is not a complaint: it is only telling about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Posl-Gazette</span><span class="font8"> mentioned that the new Thompson restaurant is equipped with Allegheny metal, which contains no copper, zinc, tin, or aluminum to react with food acids or taint foods with a metallic flavor. Allegheny metal is not plated, and is unrusting and untarnishing, and is considered the very best. Probably Mr. Mellon uses this in his own kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prof. H. J. Force, of Scranton, thirteen years a pharmaceutical chemist in New York city, and twenty-two years chief chemist of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company, humorously tells how to kill your friends with the aluminum sulphates, aluminum chlorides and aluminum hydroxide formed by cookery:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Give them the following dinner: Sauerkraut cooked in aluminum; tomatoes with salt and baking soda, cooked in aluminum; bread baked with alum baking powder; custard pie baked in an aluminum pan; and coffee made in an aluminum percolator. Let all stand twenty-four hours in aluminum, and then reheat and serve, but tell your friends what they are eating, and let them read this first. This should prove to anyone who is honest about aluminum that it is poisonous. If people will not believe the best authorities, then they must take the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Force says further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A friend of mine, after having seventeen carbuncles, threw out his fancy aluminum ware. The carbuncles disappeared. Another fed his dog from an aluminum dish; the dog died from a cancer of the face. Two others each gave a dozen young ducks water in aluminum pans, and all the ducks died in less than two weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. G. Lijjpenot, of Pennsylvania, always cooked in aluminum, and every four or five months had severe attacks starting with diarrhea and pains in the abdomen as though someone were sticking a knife in and twisting it. Sometimes she could hardly get her breath. When she switched over to enamel-ware utensils these attacks, which had persisted for years, ceased.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">A. K. Brubaker, of Pennsylvania, jeweler and optometrist, is not purchasing any more aluminum frames, finding that they give some patients a sore nose and sores back of the ear.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Paul Pierce, of Pennsylvania, writes such a comical letter that we reproduce it entire:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘After reading about aluminum about four years ago, and promptly discarding every piece of the darn stuff, we have derived great benefits. My wife had a small tumor in her one breast which left entirely in three weeks, with no recurrence in four years. She was sick continually. I was fat, ugly, and a chronic grouch. We got along like a tomcat and a bulldog in a barrel. After we sold the catalytic stuff to a junk peddler, I lost 38 pounds in a year; I lost that ever-hungry feeling. Thanks to the good articles published, we get along wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Harry C. Knapp, of Pennsylvania, dropped in weight from 195 to 140 and was so dizzy that he staggered like a drunken person. Everything he ate passed right through him, and he could get nothing to stop it. In three months from the time he replaced his aluminum ware with iron pots and granite ware he was back to himself, and has not been sick since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">H. D. Pitzer, of Pennsylvania, had a brotherin-law about to be operated on for appendicitis; they used aluminum ware exclusively in their house. Pitzer advised a change of cooking-ware as a substitute for the knife, and the prescription worked like magic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lawson H. Force, of Pennsylvania, took a new aluminum shaker, filled it half full of fresh cream, and shook it violently for fifteen minutes. At the end of that time the aluminum in the cream was so strong it could be smelled; one taste was enough to make one spit it out immediately. He believes that to drink the cream would have caused harmful results, if not death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Claude C. Corle, of Pennsylvania, had heart trouble, Bright’s disease, and strangling spells at night; his wife had kidney and bladder trouble and headaches and underwent three operations in septum, tonsils and breast. Change of cooking-ware made them completely well. Since the change they have not spent a cent for either drugs or doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">F. E. Koob, of Pennsylvania, is employed in a place where he has seen much food cooked and served in aluminum containers, with many resultant cases of indigestion, gastritis and headache readily observed. A doctor of his city ordered a patient to discard over $100 worth of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a work published by Dr. Arthur R. Cushny, of Pennsylvania, in 1906, it is established that even then it was well known that aluminum poisons the bowels and kidneys and causes degeneration of the nerve cells and fibers of the spinal cord, particularly those of the lower cranial nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Emmett Baxter, of Pennsylvania, when he discontinued using aluminum ware noticed a great improvement in his kidneys in two or three days, and in ten days a long-standing trouble had disappeared.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Quebec and Queensland</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Professor R. F. Ruttan, of Montreal, Quebec, is one of the authorities that aluminum compounds when taken internally by man are poisonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">William E. Comfort, also of Montreal, reports great benefit to his health since entirely ceasing the use of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sid. Dalia Veechia, of Queensland, nearly lost a sister and a nephew who drank milk which had stood for fourteen hours in an aluminum container. Out of twelve adults and five children at the place where the poisoning occurred these were the only ones to drink of the milk which had stood in the aluminum container, and the only ones to be made ill.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Saskatchewan, Scotland, South Dakota</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. A. M. Cook, of Saskatchewan, received from her hubby some cured finnan haddie that looked and smelled very tasty. She put it in an aluminum kettle in the cool cellar over night and boiled it twenty-five minutes the next day for the midday meal. It was so bitter it could not be eaten. Mrs. Cook noted an entire disappearance of digestive troubles since discontinuing the boiling of coffee in an aluminum percolator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Peter Crown, pioneer, of Saskatchewan, had no appetite, but did have cramps in legs and a splitting headache and expected to die almost any time. He got well from the time he gave up using aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As we go to press we have reports of 58 men of the Highland Light Infantry poisoned at Gailes, Ayrshire, Scotland. The 58 men belonged to two companies, but no cases were reported from other companies in the same battalion, or other troops encamped at Gailes. When this is sifted down it will without doubt be found that the food for the two poisoned companies was cooked and kept in aluminum containers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was a grand wholesale poisoning at the Ziebarth home in Elkton, South Dakota, that would have warmed the heart of any aluminum ware advertising man. Previous to the day of the action beef and pork were cooked in a large aluminum pot. The gravy was stored in the same utensil over night, reheated the next morning and poured over the meats, after which buns ■were prepared and placed in cartons for the noon lunch. Within three hours 250 persons were acutely affected with food poisoning, many lost their sight temporarily, and the use of their limbs. More than 150 persons received hospital treatment.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Switzerland, Tennessee, Texas</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Switzerland prohibits the use of aluminum compounds in foodstuffs. In Switzerland such a thing as happened at Elkton, South Dakota, would result in something being done for the people, but in the United States the only result would be to have somebody rush into print in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Scientific American</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary Digest </span><span class="font8">and air his profound and invincible ignorance by telling the 250 people who were nearly killed that aluminum utensils are perfectly safe. And they would prove it by quoting from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font8"> and other large advertisers of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lucy Templeton, of Tennessee, noted that the birds would not drink out of an aluminum dish. They have no advertising section to maintain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A. L. Butcher, of Tennessee, writes that squirrels will not eat nuts that are proffered to them in an aluminum container, and birds will not eat food that has been mixed in aluminum ware. On his own account he notes relief from excessive fatigue, improved memory, and a complete freedom from attacks of the flu and neuritis with which he was previously affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. W. A. Lee, of Tennessee, had an open wound on an injured leg for seven years. At one time she was in bed seven months with this, and at another time two months. The trouble disappeared completely when the aluminum ware was discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At La Grange, Texas, a lady and her daughter were made desperately ill by drinking buttermilk made in a churn the rod of the dasher of which had been painted with aluminum paint. The paint worked off with the churning process and was drunk with the buttermilk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Airs. H. D. Warren, of Texas, and her daughter, were subject to frequent vomiting spells until they threw their aluminum ware on the dump, but have had no trouble since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">D. E. Logan, Jr., of Texas, found that his boarding-house lady used for him her own aluminum coffeepot instead of the one he furnished: result, his tongue became sore and swollen on one side; but when he stopped drinking coffee at his boarding-house the tongue got well in two days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sarah Wallace, of Texas, was under a doctor’s care for fourteen years, too wretched to care whether she lived or died. During all that time she used aluminum ware exclusively. Now she says she has no aluminum ware but can put in eight hours in a day in the Lord’s service and the only thing wrong at the day’s end is that she is somewhat tired and as hungry as a bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Airs. Ruth Lloyd, of Texas, had a forty-five-piece set of aluminum ware that kept her husband, herself and two children often ill with stomach trouble, bloody flux, flu, and pains in the head. Since they discarded their nice, pretty set the whole family has been well except when they went visiting relatives who cooked in aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Airs. J. J. Johnson, of Texas, reports a woman, angry because her sick husband came home with enamel kettles, insisting, on a doctor’s orders, that all his food be cooked in them, instead of in the nice aluminum kettles she had always used, and which had kept him continually ill with stomach trouble. However, in three weeks her hubby was permanently cured, and the wife was so delighted that she took all her aluminum ware out into the back yard and, with a hammer and a large nail, made sure that every piece was ruined so that nobody else would ever be harmed by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. B. Lassiter, of Texas, with his five-year-old daughter Mary, were both killed by eating poisoned beans, carried over from a previous meal in an aluminum vessel. His wife, a sixteen-year-old son, and two daughters were made ill from the same cause. A two-year-old baby that went to bed without supper was the only member of the family not poisoned. “When this poisoning case got into the papers it was carefully referred to as “metal” poisoning, not as “aluminum” poisoning; and thus the advertising man saved his job, and the hardware man the profits on his aluminum-ware business.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Virginia and Washington</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Cr. M. Kitzmiller, of Virginia, writes that though he had been eating crabs all his life, yet when he first ate crabs cooked in aluminum utensils the crab juice ate holes in his clothing and even in his shoes wherever it touched them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Martha B. Smith, of Virginia, never had neuritis until she cooked in aluminum, got over it when she discarded the utensils, and got it immediately again when she went to a convention where the food was thus cooked, and was so ill that for two days she could not walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">R. O. Chandler, of Virginia, was told to part with his teeth and tonsils, to recover from bleeding gums and awful pains in the stomach. His wife was not told what to do for her impending cancer of the stomach. Now they no longer have any aluminum ware in the house, the husband, wife and four boys enjoy the best of health, and Chandler still has his teeth and tonsils.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">B. W. Branscome, D.C., D.O., of Virginia, released fourteen puppies, fifteen days old, one by one, into a room containing milk in an aluminum receptacle and also in a granite-ware receptacle, and every one of the puppies went to the granite-ware receptacle for its food and shunned the aluminum one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">C. A. Downey, of Washington, suffered so with gas in stomach and bowels that he lost six to eight weeks’ work each year. When he discarded his aluminum utensils he got well at once, and gained 21 pounds in weight.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Wason Brothers, of Seattle, Washington, advertise: “Don’t use aluminum or nickel coffeepot : use only seamless enamel ware.” Occasionally there is a merchant with a conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mrs. Theodore Nordenum, of Washington, reports that a neighbor 88 years of age had suffered from stomach trouble for years, but gained immediate and permanent relief when he ceased using aluminum-ware utensils.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>West Australia, West Virginia, Wisconsin</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">A gentleman, in a West Australian newspaper, merely signing himself “C.H.”, tried three times churning in aluminum ware. Each time the butter had a greenish tinge and an unpleasant taste and was thrown out. Others have noticed that mixing butter in an aluminum bowl imparts a slight color, a disagreeable odor, and a bitter, unpleasant taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">F. D. Forquer, of West Virginia, had sour stomach and gas in stomach and bowels and a nice set of aluminum cooking utensils. His kidneys pained him very much, he lost weight, and his friends thought he was going to die. His house burned down, he had to buy new utensils and selected enamel and iron, with the result that he got entirely well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two physicians and a clinic of physicians advised Mrs. Ethel Lemburg, of Wisconsin, that her only hope of life was to have her gall bladder removed; but she removed her aluminum ware instead, as being less expensive and less dangerous, and now she has perfect health and still has her gall bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a dastardly thing it is that men who already have more than heart could wish will in avarice persist in the business of poisoning millions of fellow creatures, making life miserable and hastening death. The definite breaking of the everlasting covenant does not, we may be sure, escape the notice of Jehovah. “He that is higher than the highest regardeth.” (Ecclesiastes 5: 8) The covenant which emphasizes the sanctity of life cannot be lightly broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nor can the perpetrators of slow murder come to plead ignorance of the fact that the metal they urge unsuspecting people to use for preparing their food is dangerous to health. They know the facts and have thoroughly organized their forces to suppress the truth by means of a subtle and ubiquitous censorship. The Lord Jehovah knows and will recompense the wicked. He will deliver the people, “and precious shall their blood be in His sight.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the United States Congress voted for participation in the World War, 455 for and 56 against, it made the biggest mistake ever made in the history of any nation. The influence for good then lost will never be regained, and the billions then loaned will never be repaid. Only 7 of the 56 men who voted foi' peace are still in Congress, but all agree that their course was right in 1917, when Uncle Sam was flattered into pulling the Allies’ chestnuts out of the fire. Britain’s default puts the finishing touches on American bitterness over the deal America received as a reward for its generosity, its resistless energy and courage, and its colossal foolishness. Before America would participate in another World War she would see the earth open her mouth and swallow the whole of Europe from the Urals to the Bay of Biscay. The flattery that worked before, the propaganda that was so wonderfully clever and successful and untrue, would be hooted and jeered from one end of the country to the other. Never again! If the poor of Europe had benefited to any extent, we would say less about it, but they are as badly off as the people of America.</span></p>

He believes the course of events will be, as in Germany, persecution, industrial deadlock and, eventually and inevitably, Communism. But we are convinced that God’s kingdom, man’s only hope, will cut the whole performance short. Meantime, no doubt, the Inquisition in all its “glory” is ahead. Let it come.</span></p>

Shipments of oil seeds, tallow, lard, fish oils, animal oils and fats were more than doubled, and went into Germany for the manufacture of glycerine used in high explosives. The export of copper to Sweden doubled; that of copper from Sweden to Germany trebled. In the first six weeks of 1916 Great Britain shipped 20,000 tons of zinc ore to Rotterdam, whence it went to the German munition makers. In 1915 Britain sent Sweden twelve times the amount of nickel sent in 1913. By these means Germany was able to hold out two years longer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">B</span><span class="font8">Y ARRANGING themselves in hollow cube formation bees keep their hives at 57 degrees even when it is 30 below zero. The membership of the hive is in two classes: those on the outside, that keep the cold out, and those on the inside, that work to keep up the interior heat. From time to time these change places with each other. In the summer a worker works himself to death in six weeks: the first two weeks he is a packer, working entirely on the inside of the hive; the next two weeks he is a pollen gatherer; and the last two weeks he gathers nectar, sometimes flying 84 miles and back for a single drop. The nectar when gathered is 80 percent water. This has to be condensed until it is but 18 percent water. This is done by hanging a drop on the top of a cell, where it is continually fanned by wing movements until it is ready to pack away. If humans were fed food as nutritious as that fed to the larvae of bees a baby would grow to weigh 7,000 pounds in a few weeks. Very few bees sting: it may mean death to the stinger. Bees can tell other bees when they have found a rich supply of prospective honey, but they cannot tell where it is, though they can lead the other bees to it. Bees have police that prevent strangers from entering, although bees do sometimes get into other hives than their own and steal the honey there stored.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NINTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in the series of short Bible talks by Judge Rutherford is presented herewith. The doctrine of “purgatory” is considered by many to be a Bible doctrine. Others, aware of the fact that it is not mentioned in the Bible, think that it is in harmony therewith. It is therefore appropriate in this series of Bible talks to consider the doctrine of “purgatory”, viewing it in the light of the Word of God. This Judge Rutherford does in his usual direct and straightforward way of dealing with questions which are of vital importance to the people. He does so, not for the sake of controversy, but that the people may be enlightened and have the comfort which only a proper understanding of the Holy Scriptures can bring to mankind. The lecture presented herewith deserves prayerful and thoughtful consideration.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Purgatory</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE Catholic clergy in particular, and many Protestants, teach the people that those who died in sin are now in “purgatory” or torment. What is meant by “purgatory”? and who are there ? “Purgation” means to “cleanse” or “make pure”; and the supposed “purgatory” is presumed to be a place for the cleansing of men from their sins, so that when a sinner dies he might be cleansed after being dead. The clergy claim that this may be done while he is dead. They also teach that the prayers of priests can be said for one in “purgatory” and thereby his term of punishment shortened and his release be much earlier. Many good people have paid large sums of money to Catholic priests to pray for their dead ones upon the theory that they could get them out of “purgatory”. It is therefore seen that the “purgatory” teaching has been used as a means of obtaining revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The doctrine of sinners suffering in “purgatory” is wholly false and has brought a great reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. It would be a terrible thing if the Almighty God would commit men to “purgatory” and then permit other men to pray for them to get them out, and to receive a money consideration for so doing. As the Bible plainly teaches, those who have died are entirely out of existence and unconscious, not knowing anything. If we believe the Bible, then we must certainly know that there is no person in “purgatory”, and that there is no such place in existence. There is not one scripture in the Bible to support the “purgatory” theory. The false doctrine of “purgatory” began to be taught in the Roman Catholic organization some 1600 years ago, and since that time Catholic priests have continued to preach it and collect money for prayers upon the pretext of getting men out of “purgatory”. The people have paid their money and got nothing in return. This is another false doctrine of Satan based upon his original lie, his purpose being to deceive the people and cause them to suffer both mentally and materially. Because this doctrine has been taught so many centuries doubtless many priests in the Catholic organization verily believe it to be true; but that does not make it true. Ask them to show you one text in the Bible to the effect that the dead are conscious in “purgatory”, and they will not be able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some will cite the case of the thief that was crucified the day that Jesus died. The thief said to Jesus: “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” Jesus replied: “I say unto thee today [that is, now], shalt thou be with me in paradise.” The word “paradise” means a garden or beautiful condition of the earth, and has no reference to a place of cleansing. Jesus did not go to “purgatory” or any other place that day, because He was dead and in the grave for three days. After His resurrection He ascended into heaven. “Paradise” has reference to the beautified earth which will be made so by Jesus during the time of His kingdom. The thief died that day and went into the grave, and is there yet. The meaning of Jesus’ words, therefore, is this: That because the thief exercised faith in Jesus he would be brought forth during the reign of Christ and have an opportunity to live on the beautified earth. This matter is fully explained in the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font8"> which you should read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, priests have no authority to say prayers for forgiveness of sins of those who have died. Only God can forgive sins, and prayers for the dead are not heard by Jehovah. No man’s prayers are heard until that person believes on God and Christ and then consecrates himself to do the will of God. To claim that men are suffering in “purgatory” and can be released by the prayers of others is not only a false doctrine, but a defamation of God’s name. The dead are in the tomb awaiting to be awakened out of death. Jesus said: ‘Marvel not: the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves shall hear His voice and come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection by judgment.’ (John 5:28,29) Each one must decide for himself whether he desires to believe the words of imperfect men or to take the authoritative words of the Lord. My advice is that you read your Bible, together with the books explaining it, and find out these truths for yourself. Learn of Jehovah and do His will, and He will enlighten you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">(Repiinted from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Typographical Jouma</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font8">RTICLE 123 of the constitution of Mexico covers “Labor and Social Welfare&quot;. What has taken the labor movement of Europe and the United States many years of agitation, organization, struggle and sacrifice to establish is sought to be accomplished in Mexico by constitutional provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Economic reforms are established with magnificent courage and thoroughness in Article 123 of the Mexican constitution and written into the basic law of the land. No supreme court can declare these measures unconstitutional, for they are part and parcel of the constitution itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The labor of workmen, journeymen, employees, domestic servants, artisans, and, in general, all labor, is governed by laws in conformity with the following principles laid down in the constitution :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Eight hours is the maximum limit of a day’s work, and seven hours the maximum limit of a night’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Workmen must receive at least one day’s rest for every six days worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When necessary to work overtime it shall be paid for at the rate of double time. In no case may the overtime exceed three hours daily nor continue for more than three consecutive days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No women of any age nor boys under fifteen years are allowed to work overtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Unhealthy and dangerous occupations are forbidden to women in general and to boys under sixteen years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Children under twelve years of age are not permitted to work in factories, and for children over twelve and under sixteen the maximum limit of a day’s work is six hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The minimum wage paid a workman must be sufficient to supply the normal needs of life of the workman, his education and his lawful pleasures, considered as the head of a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all agricultural, commercial, manufacturing or mining enterprises the workman has the right to share in the profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fixing of the minimum wage and the profit-sharing is done by special commissions appointed in each community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same wage must be paid for the same work, regardless of sex or nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the three months immediately preceding childbirth, women shall not perform any work requiring considerable physical effort;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By John C. Harding </span><span class="font8">during the month following childbirth they shall enjoy a rest with their wages paid in full and retain their employment. During the time of lactation they are allowed two daily periods of rest of one-half hour each in order to nurse their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The employer who discharges a workman without just cause or for being a member of a union, or for having taken part in a strike, must, at the option of the workman, either continue employing him or indemnify him by the payment of three months’ wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(It is said that President Obregon used this section of the constitution to compel British and American oil operators in Mexico to continue operating their works when they at one time threatened to lock out their Mexican workers by shutting down.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all agriculture, industrial, mining or other class of work, employers are obliged to furnish their workmen with comfortable and sanitary habitations, for which they may charge rents not exceeding one-half of one percent of the assessed value of the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In labor centers, when their population exceeds two hundred inhabitants, a designated space of land shall be set aside for public purposes and the construction of places of amusement. The establishment of saloons and gambling houses is prohibited in such labor centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The laws recognize the right of workmen and employers to strike and suspend work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Strikes are lawful when their object is to secure a balance between the various factors of production and to harmonize the rights of capital and labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suspensions of work shall be lawful only when the excess of production renders it necessary to close down in order to maintain prices above the cost of production, and when previously approved by the board of conciliation and arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every contract between a Mexican and a foreign employer must be legalized before a competent municipal authority and viseed by the consul of the country to which the workman wishes to go, with the understanding that in addition to the usual clauses it is clearly specified that the cost of repatriation of the laborer shall be at the cost of the foreign employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following stipulations are null and void and not binding on the contracting parties, even</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">though included in the contract: Those which provide foi' an inhuman day’s work, on account of its notorious excessiveness. Those providing a wage which in the judgment of the board of conciliation and arbitration is not remunerative. Those which provide a period of more than one week before wages are paid. Those which assign places of amusement, eating houses, cafes, taverns, saloons or shops for the payment of wages, unless employees of such establishments are the ones involved. Those which involve a direct or indirect obligation to purchase articles of consumption in specified shops or places. Those which permit retaining wagos by way of fines. Those constituting a renunciation on the part of the workman of the indemnities to which he may be entitled because of labor accidents or diseases contracted from the work, damages occasioned by nonperformance of the contract, or for discharge from the work. All other stipulations which imply the waiver by the workman of some right vested in him by the labor laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Considered of social utility: Institutions of popular insurance for old age, sickness, life, lack of employment, accident, and others of a similar character; therefore, both the federal and state governments encourage the organization of such institutions, to instill and inculcate habits of thrift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cooperative associations for the construction of cheap and sanitary habitations for workmen are likewise to be considered of public utility, when these properties are intended to be acquired in ownership by the workmen within specified periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Minimum Wages in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font8">ANADIANS trying to find out minimum wages being paid workers in that fair land found girls working in a biscuit factory in Montreal 72 hours a week and receiving in wages, salary, emoluments, bonus and compensation in general the munificent sum of $1.50 per week. In Quebec, where the Roman Catholic system is in full control of everything, they found one family with six persons working, two females and four males, and among them they earned a gross income of $20 per week. A big slice of this $20 goes to the priest, as a matter of course. And if any of the six dies, then another big hunk must go to him or he won’t say any masses for the “repose of their souls”. And that would be just too bad; now, wouldn’t it? One of the girls in this family works 55 hours a week and receives $2. If this girl goes wrong and then subsequently dies one wonders if her Catholic employer will do the handsome thing and come across with a nice little bonus to be turned over to the priest for the “repose of her soul”. Seems as though it would be a nice thing to do, doesn’t it? It seems there is a direct relation between income and subsequent “repose of the soul”; the less income you get here, why, according to Roman Catholic theology, the less chance of “repose for your soul” hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is the Most Valuable Citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HO is the most valuable citizen, the man with the little income, who is forced to spend almost all that he receives, or the man with the big income, who spends only a very little of it and is almost forced to see his pile of riches get bigger and ever bigger? The man with the little income helps everybody with whom he comes in contact. The man with the big income cannot even help himself, because the safety of his pile depends upon the contentment of the common people. It is calculated that in 1929 the classes with incomes of $1,000 or under expended 94 percent for goods and services, 3 percent went for taxes, and 3 percent was saved, while in that same year the classes w’ith incomes of over $1,000,000 expended but 6 percent for goods and services, 17 percent went for taxes, and the huge amount of 77 percent was saved to accentuate still further the difference between the moneyed classes and those that have little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Work for 200 Men</span></p>

Well, it does not seem just the right thing, in these days when jobs are so scarce, for the childless married women to be working for good wages while their husbands are also working for good wages.</span></p>

What do you think of a system that makes it possible for one man, Eugene Grace, president of the Bethlehem Steel Company, to receive as salary and bonus $5,450 per day, while 14,000,000 are unemployed and get nothing?” For his own highly important work Mr. Thompson last year received in salary a sum so small that the only way he could live was by fees received for outside lectures.

Start to number consecutively and fill the spaces as follows: (See square of [9 by 9] eighty-one numbers.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Begin just under the center square; always drop down to next square to be filled, that is, down one and over one. When you drop below the bottom line, or to the right of the last perpendicular line, proceed as shown in the movements 4-5 and 5-6. When the square is occupied, proceed as in the movements 9-10 and 18-19, where such procedure is possible, but in other cases proceed as in movements 36-37 and 45-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Henkels says: “The sums are always equal and must be worked according to rule; errors are detected at once when figures do not fit. Why this works out I do not know. If it interests the ‘figure minded’ it serves its purpose. With a little practice the solution is almost automatic, so easily is it performed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just to show what can be done with this arrangement, we take a square of twenty-five numbers, and instead of starting with 1 we start with 3. Then instead of placing in consecutive numbers we place numbers three apart and get this:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">69 18 57 6 45</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In working this out we find that when the uniform sum of the columns in any ‘magic square’ (195 in this instance) is divided by the number of figures in a column (5 in this instance) the result is the figure which goes in the center square (in this instance 39).</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">AYS Joann Barnhill, of Kansas: “I have a heart lesion and am unable to eat any food that is harsh in fiber, such as spinach, bran, pineapple, etc. Knowing I need fresh vegetables, and being unable to eat any raw ones or raw fruit, I have had a problem. Here is what I found, by experiment. Spinach makes a delightful drink, tasting much like cherry juice, when I get it ready to drink. To illustrate my point: I have a friend who abhors spinach. I said one day, ‘Do you like cherry juice’’ The answer was ‘Yes’. I said, ‘I believe I will fix you a good drink.’ He thought it was cherry juice, wondered about the color, but said it was most refreshing. I then told him it was spinach juice; he looked horrified for a minute and then remarked that ‘anyway, it was a darned good drink’. Since then we have had several good laughs over it. Being a male creature, and very set, it was quite a concession for him to make. Pull the leaves from fresh New Zealand spinach and extract the juice. My method is to shred with scissors, place in bowl and mash and mash and mash until the leaves are bruised and juice runs out; then I pour cold water over them, stir well, pour in sieve, drain off the juice and add to a tart lemonade. I cannot retain orange juice with any degree of comfort, but this green lemonade, which tastes exactly like cherry juice, seems to agree with me perfectly. I thought perhaps some other of the Lord’s poor sick ones might be benefited, so am happy if I could bring a little comfort to someone in sending it to you. Spinach is so rich in minerals, and yet so many folks do not like it. I feel sure if they will only try this delicious, refreshing drink they will never again say, ‘I don’t like spinach.’ None of the rich minerals are lost when served in this manner, as they are when the spinach is cooked.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Jesus Born About October First</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH lias caused to be written in His Word all things necessary for the man of God. (2 Timothy 3:16,17) By overlooking the plain statements of the Bible man throws himself open to the temptations of the enemy, spends his life foolishly, and brings much sorrow both upon himself and his friends. Especially now are all men invited to study the Word of the Lord, because the truth is being revealed as never before, it is the time of preparation for a new kingdom on earth, and a knowledge of Jehovah is essential to life everlasting.—John 17: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since Jehovah has made it very plain in His Word in respect to the details of the event, and since millions of people have for centuries been laboring under the wrong impression, it must be pleasing to the Lord that His people examine the scriptures concerning the time of the birth of Jesus. While it is true that there are more important things relative to the Son of Jehovah than the exact time of His birth, yet there are several reasons why a correct understanding at this time is profitable and praiseworthy. As we examine the correctness of the Lord's Word we can appreciate a reliance upon Him rather than put confidence in the teachings of men. At once we are struck with the blindness of the teachers of religion, both Catholic and Protestant, and how the archenemy has kept the people in subjection. (Matthew 15:14) We can see in the light of God’s Word that there are two organizations: the teachings of Jehovah’s kingdom lead to usefulness, praise, and life everlasting; the precepts of Satan’s hierarchy result in burdening the people with more than they can bear, the teachings are a reproach to Jehovah, and they result in destroying the faith that many honest-hearted people desire to have in the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is here written is not done to harm any creature or to make a personal attack upon individuals; but the truth is plainly stated to help some honest-hearted that they might see the light, be set free from the entanglements of error, and be enabled to take the first steps in becoming joyful workers in this new kingdom which is even now operating among men. Be it noted at the very outset that the purpose of getting the truth is not one of personal satisfaction in itself, but that one might be furnished for the real and the only work profitable under the sun. Man’s entire make-up bears evidence that he is an expressive creature, and when his faculties are intelligently directed in accordance with the Word of God he becomes a praise to his Creator. That man might praise Jehovah is the Creator’s purpose in placing him on earth. —Psalm 145:10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>Scriptural Proof</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Scholars, including some of the theologians themselves, have admitted that the time and practices of the Christmas season have a heathen origin. We will not take the time to examine how the various customs and ceremonies have crept into the observance of Christmas; sufficient has already been written thereon by students of history. Then, too, that would be a negative way of treating the subject. On the other hand, the Bible furnishes us with the positive information upon which we can form definite conclusions. We just can’t improve upon the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah caused the necessary information to be written by Luke to help us to arrive at the correct time of the birth of Jesus. By the way, it may be noted according to the Scriptures that Luke was a physician, and his practical knowledge would enable him to take a greater interest in stating the details relative to the birth of the Savior. (Colossians 4:14) In Luke 1: 5 we read, ‘■'There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of the course of Abijah:</span><span class="font8"> and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> It is important to note that Zacharias functioned in the priest’s office in the course of Abijah. The specific time of this course is referred to in the eighth and twenty-third verses of the same chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, what connection has this course of Abijah, which according to the Scriptures was a period of about fifteen days, to do with the birth of Jesus? Why was it so carefully stated in this chapter bearing upon the conceptions of both Jesus and John the Baptist? If we can show from the Scriptures the exact time during the year when the course of Abijah occurs; furthermore, if we can prove that it was at the end of this course that John the Baptist was conceived; and then if the Bible discloses that the conception of Jesus was about six months later, all of these things would form an unbreakable chain leading to the certain conclusion as to when the birth of Jesus occurred. So</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">that the reader may be assured of the objective, it can with certainty be said that each of the above steps may be proved by the plain statements of the Bible.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Courses and Months</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">According to the commandment of Jehovah there were twenty-four courses of service each year to come into the house of the Lord. (1 Chronicles 24:1-19) Those who served in the various courses were the sons of Aaron, and they served in the capacity of priests in the temple. This would allow of two different sets of priests each month to serve in that capacity. Concerning Zacharias it is written, “And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.” (Luke 1: 8-10) According to the Scriptures, be it noted that the course of Abijah occurred the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">eighth</span><span class="font8"> in order, and it was this course that Zacharias filled in the capacity of priest. (1 Chronicles 24:10) Since two sets of priests served each month, and Zacharias served eighth in order, it naturally follows that his course of service fell in the latter part of the fourth month according to the custom of the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to more specifically locate the time of the year when Zacharias served as priest in the temple it will assist us materially to know when the first month began. According to Jewish reckoning the month began with the new moon. In the new moon the Israelites were commanded to offer burnt sacrifices unto the Lord, in addition to those offered on the sabbaths and in the set feasts. (1 Chronicles 23:31; 2 Chronicles 2:4; 31:3; Amos 8:5) So the Lord gives us Scriptural information connecting the new moon with the beginning of the month, in 1 Samuel 20: 24-27. It was customary for David to sit with King Saul to eat meat “when the new moon was come”. Furthermore, in the twenty-seventh verse it is written, “And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty.” See also verse 34.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Beginning of Year</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah provided a means whereby His typical people might determine the beginning of the first month of their year. It marked the time of the spring harvest period, which in the land of Israel occurs about the time of the spring equinox. Today the Jewish first month is calculated by Jehovah’s witnesses from the new moon nearest the spring equinox. According to the law the priest was to wave the sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest on the morrow following the sabbath after the passover. In Leviticus 23: 5-11 we read, “In the fourteenth day -of the first month at even is the Lord’s passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord : seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, &quot;When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest; and ye shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">on the morroiv after the sabbath</span><span class="font8"> [next day after passover] the priest shall wave it.” This first month of the year was called Abib; later, after the captivity, it was called Nisan, and in it was celebrated the Lord’s passover. “This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.” (Exodus 12: 2) The details of the Lo'rd’s passover are stated in Exodus 12:3-51. More recently it has been customary to reckon the beginning of the first month under consideration at the new moon nearest the spring equinox. But the Scriptural proof is sufficient in itself that this month began in the spring of the year, and at the new moon of the harvest season; the fourteenth day thereof, Jewish reckoning, would mark the full moon and the time of the passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since Zacharias who became the father of John the Baptist served in the course of Abijah (Luke 1:5), and this course was the eighth in order (1 Chronicles 24:10), it follows that he served the latter half of the fourth month, which would at the earliest be the latter part of our month June. While serving in his course the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.” (Luke 1:13) And now note how carefully Jehovah fixes the time period in Luke 1:23-25, “And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. And after those days, his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.” This occurred early in July according to our reckoning.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Time of Annunciation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">And now follows the clue to when we may know to be the time of the conception of Jesus. “And </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">in the sixth month</span><span class="font8"> the angel Gabriel was sent from God, unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.” (Luke 1:26,27) Among other things which the angel spoke to Mary were these: “Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the sixth month</span><span class="font8"> with her who was called barren.” (Luke 1: 30, 31, 36) This occurred about December 25 according to the Jewish manner of reckoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to Jehovah’s fixed time, nine months later Jesus was born. It was while Joseph was in Bethlehem “to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn”. (Luke 2:5-7) Thus the birth of Jesus occurred about October first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It might be added by way of reasonable explanation that according to our way of calculating the days and months the exact birthday anniversary of Jesus from year to year would vary at most about two weeks for six lunar months after the spring equinox, the beginning of the month Nisan being at the new moon nearest that equinox. The Jewish month, calculated according to the lunar cycle, is somewhat shorter than our own modern solar month, and hence every several years an extra month was added to the Jewish lunar year. These facts were taken into consideration in reaching the calculation of about October first. However, the exact day from year to year would not fall more than two weeks away from the date October first. The confusion in calculating time is not due to any fault with the lunar system of calculating the months and seasons, but to our own modern way. Undoubtedly at some time in God’s kingdom man will use the right way of calculating months and seasons as appointed by Jehovah God. “He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.”— Psalm 104:19.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Corroborative Proof</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Another line of proof supports the above finding and is also based upon the Scriptures. Jesus became the Messiah of Jehovah at the time of His anointing, and this took place when He was thirty years of age. It was at the Jordan river that Jesus was begotten as the Son of God by the spirit of Jehovah, and then the call to the Kingdom was extended to Him, which call He accepted, and He was there in line for the Kingdom as the great Prince or Son of the King of eternity. (Luke 3: 21, 22; Jeremiah 10:10) The actual anointing of Jesus took place within a reasonable time thereafter (Luke 4:1-21); but it is sufficient to know from the Scriptures that at that time “Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age”.—Luke 3: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, according to Daniel 9:24 “seventy weeks” were determined upon the nation of Israel to “'make reconciliation for iniquity”. As in the case of Genesis 29: 27, these were “weeks” of seven years each. A day is appointed for a year in the construction of this prophecy. (Ezekiel 4:6) It will be noted that Christ as the Messiah of Jehovah came at the end of the sixty-ninth week and the beginning of the seventieth week appointed for reconciliation. Daniel 9: 25 states: “Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem [454 B.C.], unto the Messiah [the Anointed One] the Prince, shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks”; a total of sixty-nine weeks. Verse 26 continues: “And after threescore and two weeks [which followed the seven weeks] shall Messiah be cut </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">off,”</span><span class="font8"> in death. Now, in the twenty-seventh verse it is stated: “And he [Christ, the Messiah, or Anointed One] shall confirm the covenant with many for one week [the seventieth week]: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the above the Messiah was literally “cut off” “in the midst of the week”, when His sacrifice ended. The &quot;midst of the week” would be at the end of three and one-half years after His coming as the Messiah or Anointed One. Hence it follows that Jesus was just thirty-three and one-half years of age when He was crucified. The ministry of Jesus extended over four passover seasons, and at the last one thereof Jesus was actually killed and became the great Passover for the sins of all who believe on Him. (1 Corinthians 5:7) The several passovers during His ministry are specifically mentioned at John 2:23; 5:1; 6:4; 19:14. Since the passover of the Jews occurs in the spring of the year, in the middle of the lunar month Abib, or Nisan, or about the first part of the modern month of April, it was at that time that Jesus was thirty-three and one-half years of age, when He was crucified and thus “cut off”. Counting back one-half year, or six months, previous to that time would bring us to about October first, the birth season of Jesus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Circumstantial Evidence</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Circumstantial evidence also corroborates the time features pointed out, that it was not in the beginning of winter when Jesus was born, but at a milder time of the year. The shepherds were out in the fields at nighttime, tending their flocks, when Jesus was born. (Luke 2: 8-20) In the latter part of December such a thing would be unreasonable, for the rainy season and cold weather is over Palestine during that time, and there is no grass to feed the sheep in the open. (Ezra 10: 9,13) The sheep during that time are kept in folds until milder weather invites them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the statements of the Bible show that Jesus was born about October first, should we celebrate that season of the year in honor of the birth of the Savior ? No! Jesus never instructed His followers to hold any such celebration; neither does Jehovah at any place in the Scriptures warrant the observance of such a season. Much of the money that is spent in getting sick on such an occasion, and the time spent fussing around trying to make creatures happy (if they are actually made so), might better be spent in talking about the works of Jehovah and about the time coming, under the Kingdom, when men will think right and act right and be a real praise to the Creator.—Psalm 145:10-13.</span></p>

The productive power of its workers is unequaled anywhere. Man for man the American produces more coal, more metal, more food, more fabrics, more transportation, than does any other worker. Today almost all this vast property is in the hands of a few people who if left to themselves could not make a living, but the ones who do all the work, and have produced all the wealth, have lost their homes, their savings, their insurance and their hope. God’s kingdom alone can straighten out this otherwise hopeless tangle. In the face of all this, in radio and other fields, there is the most desperate effort being put forth to get yet more into the hands of those who already have it nearly all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That the governments of the world are breaking down is apparent to everyone who thinks. What is the cause? and what will result? Is there an effective remedy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Centuries ago Jehovah God caused to be written in the Holy Scriptures the full, complete and satisfying answers to the above questions, and which answers could not be understood until certain events came to pass in recent years. This booklet I am handing you, called </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> gives the answer to these questions, and its contents will greatly cheer you and comfort your heart and enable you to worship in spirit and in truth the Almighty God. For your own good you should read it carefully, and for the good of your friends and neighbors you should encourage them to read it. This is your copy, and you may, if you will, contribute five cents, which will be used for the publication of more booklets of the same kind. Knowledge of God’s purpose is now of greater necessity than anything else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">League of Nations—Anglo-Papal Conquest of the U. S*</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">Mr. John </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font5"> Kennedy, writing in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font5"> of March 8, 1934, says of this propaganda scheme (and we doubt if even he begins to see the magnitude of the stakes for which Britain and the Boman hierarchy are playing):</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The most comprehensive propaganda machine ever set up In America Is now engaged In an effort to force the United States into the League of Nations and its World Court, a survey discloses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Backed by funds of approximately $15,000,000, It Is reaching out In an effort to control public opinion through schools, libraries, colleges, churches and civic and professional organizations on the subject of American participation In International affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Already it Is having Its effect in Washington where a flood of petitions, seeking ratification of the League Court, are being received by the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Internationalists In that body are seeking Immediate action on the Court at this session of Congress.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N MODERN conquest bankers are more powerful than bullets. Propaganda is many more times effective than machine guns. It is not our business to keep the United States out of the League of Nations, but it is our business to expose the crooked bunch that is trying to inveigle this country into it. There is more to this issue than even the legislators at Washington have seemed to appreciate. The League of Nations is the Devil’s counterfeit for God’s kingdom. Thus this is more than a question of mere ‘entanglements by foreign alliances’. It is one in which each legislator comes into responsibility before his Maker. Hence we here set ourselves to prove, as briefly as possible, the following facts:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(1) The British government, i.e., the international bankers, are back of the League of Nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) The Federal Council of Churches is in league with the British government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(3) The Roman Catholic hierarchy is supporting the Federal Council of Churches.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(4) The National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System are in league with the Federal Council of Churches and the Catholic hierarchy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Idea of a League of Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1511, again in 1538, and again in the seventeenth century there were what were called “Holy Leagues” of nations. The British government was not in any of those leagues. In the past two hundred years it has had extensive experience in India in governing twenty or more native states representing a conglomeration of peoples, religions and interests that is equaled in complexity only by the League of Nations w’hich meets at Geneva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the war Britain conceived the idea of getting all nations into the conflict and having a league of nations at its close which would be dominated by Great Britain. The idea of a league of nations did not originate in the United States, though it was often mentioned here. Whittier had a poem about it, and he had been dead for twenty-seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1918, before the war was ended, the National Committee of the Churches on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moral Aims of the War prepared a brochure entitled “League of Nations Outlined for Discussion”. This work was copyrighted by The World Conference for International Friendship Through the Churches, 70 Fifth Ave., New York, N. Y. It stated, among other things, that </span><span class="font5">“the time has arrived when the free nations must undertake the orderly development of the world, its economic betterment and education for self-government.” “The co-operation of the Allies has been the world’s most successful experiment in brotherhood.” “In England the powerful British Labor Party, the Anglican and free churches, business and other organizations, have declared in favor of the program.” “In England Premier Lloyd George, former Premier Asquith, Viscount Bryce, Viscount Grey, Arthur J. Balfour, the archbishop of Canterbury, and hundreds</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of other prominent men and women in all walks of life, are ardent advocates of a league of nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Great Britain Is the League”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What happened after the World War is well known. President Wilson was the spokesman for the League of Nations, put forward by himself, General Jan Smuts and others, but it was Great Britain’s hand that shaped the covenant and the Treaty of Versailles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the terms, five of the belligerents among the Allies, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States, were in the first class of belligerent powers, i.e., the class with general interests. Germany was forced to sign the treaty June 28,1919. Great Britain ratified in 33 days, but it took Italy 101 days, France 107 days, and Japan 124 days to ratify. The United States has not yet ratified, but desperate efforts are being made to cause it to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason why Great Britain was so prompt to ratify the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations is that the League is Britain’s own child, the agency through which it hopes to govern the entire world throughout the future as it has governed India in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express,</span><span class="font6"> April 30, 1931, appears in bold-face type a truth which to the editor of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font6"> required no argument. It merely said, “Great Britain </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6"> the League. We are its one great strength.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In May, 1926, Judge Rutherford himself told the British government that very thing to its face. Speaking to an audience that packed out the huge Royal Albert Hall, London, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one will attempt to deny that the British world power is the earthly agency that was responsible for the formation of the League of Nations compact. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The British Empire is the very bulwark thereof. Let Britain withdraw and there will be no League of Nations.</span><span class="font5"> But who is primarily responsible for the League of Nations compact? Is it formed and does it exist by divine right and authority? I answer, No. The Devil is its father, the British Empire is its mother, and the other nations which support it are its wet nurses. At this time the advocates of the League of Nations are desperately striving to unite its belligerent members. With fear and trembling they see that unholy offspring of Satan headed for perdition, even as the Lord foretold.—Revelation 17: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day following Judge Rutherford’s address the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font6"> of London, one of the leading newspapers, carried a full report thereof; the regular circulation of that paper at that time was 800,000 copies per day, and in addition thereto many extra copies were printed and distributed. Thus Britain had notice served upon it at its very seat of government. Shortly thereafter millions of copies of that same address were distributed freely from house to house throughout the United States. The president and other members of the government at Washington were personally served with copies thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the 57 member states of the League of Nations, seven are Australia, Canada, Great Britain, India, Irish Free State, New Zealand, and South Africa. The population of Australia is the same as that of Ohio; that of Canada a little more than that of Pennsylvania; New Zealand has less than Connecticut; the Irish Free State has less than Indiana; and there are twice as many whites in the little state of New Jersey as there are in the whole Union of South Africa. Great Britain itself has a population equal to that of New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio, which states include about 40 percent of the population of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was and is the idea of British statesmen that if and when the United States joins this League of Nations it must come in on the same basis as, let us say, New Zealand. The only difference is to be that the United States shall have a chromo, i.e., be a permanent member of the council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Federation of Churches Is the Tool</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we prove point (2), The Federal Council of Churches is in league with the British government. In January 1919 the august body of ecclesiastics composing the council of the church federation issued the following blasphemous proclamation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">it is rather the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth. . . </span><span class="font5">. The church can give a spirit of good will, without which no League of Nations can endure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tool which the British government has used and is using to coax the United States into the League of Nations is the Federal Council of Churches. We present herewith excerpts from the annual reports of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have repeatedly urged all the members of the churches to write strongly worded letters to their senators urging them to take a stand in favor of the ratification of the League Covenant, to urge their friends to write to their senators and for the local world alliance to send a strong resolution to the senators and to Mr. Lodge, the chairman of the foreign relations committee.” ... “A prayer on the League of Nations was prepared and distributed among the preachers of the country. This prayer was read from the pulpits of many churches.” . . . “Throughout the whole year we have urged the preachers of the United States to present in sermons and in classes the great idea of the League of Nations. It is estimated that we have reached fully ten million people in our campaign.”—From the Report of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ for 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;The Supreme Hope for the Future&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The League of Nations. The supreme hope for the future is in the League of Nations. This is the one worth-while definite thing that has come out of the war. The call for our nation to enter this league and help make it a really effective instrument for righting wrong and adjusting national difficulties is the greatest moral call that has ever been given to the church in all its history. The peace of the world and the hope for humanity rest upon the proper strengthening and functioning of the League.” . . . “There is one clear and incisive call to the Churches of Christ in America at the present time, and that is the call for co-operation on the part of all men and women of good will to the end that our nation may speedily and heartily become a part of this great, international enterprise.” . . . “Of the nation as of the individual it is true that the way of love and trust is the way of salvation and that he that would be greatest must be servant of all. We welcome, therefore, the development of a league of nations which shall be in truth an association of free peoples for the achieving of world peace, for mutual disarmament and for constructive service, and we call upon our own nation to join with other nations in moving along this new pathway of hope.”—Report for 1920, pages 157, 158, and 313.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Hierarchy Supports Federation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Point (3) charges, The Roman Catholic hierarchy is supporting the Federal Council of Churches. This is a hard point, but, if you are hard to convince, read the following excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before the Paris Covenant was published this committee had edited and published a series of six lessons on the League of Nations, which were distributed to the churches and about one hundred thousand copies were used. The entire work cost about one hundred thousand dollars, and through the commission on international justice and good will all the leading Protestant denominations were enlisted, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and through the church peace union and the world alliance the Roman Catholics and Jews were brought in</span><span class="font5"> so that the national committee on the churches and the moral aims of the war may be said to be probably the most representative committee that has ever attempted to speak in America for the total religious life of our people. When the war came to a victorious end, we were at once faced with the necessity of setting to work to help build a new world order in which the repetition of such a disaster to civilization would be made forever impossible. ”—Report for 1920, page 160.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The commission on international justice and good will has never had a year when its opportunities and tasks were so great. Immediately following the conference on limitation of armaments came the question of informing the public with regard to its achievements and their significance and of securing public sentiment to bring about the ratification of the treaties. This was carried on by our usual procedure, through communications sent to the local council of churches and to the secular and religious members, a special mass meeting in Washington and a special letter sent to all local churches in the constituency of the Federal Council. This letter was sent out by the church peace union </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">together with similar communications from the National Catholic Welfare Council and the two national organizations of Jewish rabbis.” </span><span class="font5">—Report for 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Willing to Accept Any Substitute</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy have shown with unanimity that they do not desire God’s kingdom, for which Jesus taught us to pray, and that they are willing, nay, eager, to accept any substitute for it. Everybody knows that the various peace conferences in Europe have been a succession of dreary failures. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> (edited by Judge Rutherford), in its issue of July 15,1923, says on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When the League of Nations compact was formulated in 1919, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America called upon the people of the earth to support it and hailed it as the savior of mankind, employing the statement: ‘It is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth.’ The American people repudiated the League of Nations at the polls; but the professional politicians, big business and big preachers are still trying to inveigle the people of this land into the League. A press dispatch from Washington under date of May 31, 1923, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘A call to 125,000 congregations in America to rally to the support of President Harding’s proposal that the United States enter the Permanent Court of International Justice was issued here today by the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. With the Federal Council are affiliated thirty communions with an adult membership of more than 20,000,000 persons.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few years ago there was a campaign put on by 140,000 clergymen of the United States to force the United States into the League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We continue with citations from the annual reports of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America in further confirmation, showing that in the years since the war the Federal Council has learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Instead of putting its hope in God and in His Word, it is putting it in men in whom nobody any longer has any confidence whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The prophecies of Micah and Isaiah at last begin to receive fulfilment. Mighty nations are actually scrapping weapons that cost them hundreds of millions. These are epochal days in the history of the kingdom of God.” . . . “Disarmament Sunday was widely observed in every part of the land. In response to the same appeal, a petition to President Harding was signed by 22,500 clergymen of all denominations. ’ ’ —Report for 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As is now well known, an official statement was issued by the Government after the conference was over stating that of the thirteen million letters, telegrams and other requests which came to the government, urging a reduction of armaments in some form, more than twelve million bore on their face evidence of having come from people who were thinking of the problem in religious terms.”—Report for 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before the war closed the churches with practical unanimity were calling for the formation of a league of nations in which justice, fair dealing and security would be assured to all alike, great and small, powerful and weak. When the concrete plan, however, came to our people, in the treaty of Versailles, and became a decisive political issue, the churches and the Federal Council ceased to urge American membership in the League.”—Report for 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fifty-three nations, including the United States, have renounced war as an instrument of national policy. They have agreed that the settlement of all disputes ‘shall never be sought except by pacific means.’ The churches rejoice in this great moral victory. When the proposal for a renunciation of war treaty was first made by Mr. Briand, the members of our churches were quick to respond. From pulpits and pews there was voiced a strong desire that the United States co-operate with other nations in putting aw<sup>7</sup>ay forever the instruments of war. When the pact was finally negotiated 180,000 members and friends of the various communions in the United States signed the memorial prepared and distributed by the commission petitioning the Senate to ratify the treaty.”— Report for 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Connections of Federal Council</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The outstanding event of the year in the movement for world peace was the London Naval Conference, which convened on January 21st and continued until April 22nd. In this conference the churches of the United States took keen interest. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">During the autumn of 1929 the Federal Council conferred with the archbishop of Canterbury and the outstanding leaders of the British free churches</span><span class="font5"> and agreements were reached to observe Sunday January 19th as a special day of prayer. The evangelical churches of France and Japan were also invited to join in observing the day. Christian people in all these lands welcomed that significant gathering of statesmen and followed its proceedings with prayer until it closed. When it appeared that the conference was in danger of adjourning without an agreement having been reached, the administrative committee, on February 28th, expressed its earnest hope ‘that the American delegation at the London Naval Conference will find the way to translate into fact the spirit of President Hoover’s address on Armistice Day, 1929, in which he said, “We will reduce our naval strength in proportion to any other. ’ ’ ’ Having said that it only remains for the others to say how low they will go. It cannot be too low for us. ’ ’—Report for 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The heads of more than twenty denominations joined with the officials of the Federal Council in recommending to the churches and allied religious organizations the observance of Sunday, November 8th, as a special day of prayer in the interest of world peace and the reduction of armaments. From many pulpits and pews the prayer was offered ‘that the governments represented at the disarmament conference may succeed in so scaling down armaments and armament budgets as to enable them to give greater attention to the spiritual, social and humanitarian needs of their respective peoples. ’ ’ ’—Report for 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Federal Council Makes a Good Tool</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that England gets along in India by playing peoples of one race and religion against peoples of another race and religion. For this reason, and because the Anglican church is part and parcel of the British Empire, it more readily occurs to British statesmen to make use of a church organization for political purposes than it would to some American statesmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyone who will carefully consider the foregoing citations from the Federal Council’s annual reports will observe that the only reason why the Federal Council has remained silent some of the time in recent years on the subject of the United States’ joining the League of Nations has been of a political nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the change in political leadership March 4, 1933, the hopes of Great Britain and of the Federal Council of Churches that the United States could be inveigled into the League were revived and strengthened. The new attempt to get the United States in is not made under the name of the Federal Council of Churches, but under the name of the League of Nations Association, Inc. But the names back of the association, Raymond B. Fosdick, president, and Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, chairman of the Council, reveal that the persons who are interested in getting the United States into the League of Nations now are the same people who were interested in getting it into the League fifteen years ago. The following is a portion of the account of the new movement to crowd the United States in as it appeared in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">of February 15, 1934:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTION ON LEAGUE URGED IN PETITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nation-wide plea to be made for naming of an official delegate to Geneva. Is backed by 15 groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1,000,000 signatures sought for request for statement of terms of membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediate appointment by the United States of an official representative to the League of Nations is urged in a petition just started which is to be circulated throughout the nation by fifteen organizations interested in world peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The petition, which will be presented to President Roosevelt as soon as it contains 1,000,000 signatures, also asks that the government define the specific terms under which the United States might be willing to accept membership in the League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations Association, of which Raymond B. Fosdick is president and Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler chairman of the council, started the movement and has sent several thousand copies of the petition to branches of the participating organizations in every State in the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Appeal Itself</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The petition sheets provide for twenty signatures each beneath the following heading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anxious to avoid war and organize peace in which prosperity can thrive,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believing that the collective system of the world community which includes the Kellogg-Briand Paet (Pact of Paris) to which the United States is a party, and the League of Nations, can best prevent war,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mindful of the fact that the United States is participating in many activities of the League of Nations,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aware that without the privilege of membership in the League the United States is placed at a disadvantage, and the moral integrity of the world community is weakened,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Urge that the United States reinforce the League’s contribution to peace by stating the terms under which full membership would be possible; and by appointing in the meantime an official diplomatic representative to the League of Nations to participate in its deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the bottom of the signature sheet is the inquiry, clear across the sheet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In a world as dark as this, why blow out the only light there is?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the outside of the petition sheet or folder, which is more than twice the size it needs to be for the number of names contained, appears the following letter, and it will be observed that those who have written the letter are so deeply impressed with what they regard as their wise saying that they have repeated it:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Treasurer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Friends of the League of Nations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our generation has witnessed the attempt to build a new instrument of social control, a new type of collective machinery, based on the belief that in a world economically and politically interdependent old ideas of isolation must give way to a realistic method of international consultation and teamwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this moment of nationalist reaction we need to be reminded that it takes faith and patience to develop a community of the nations of the world. No new social institution is ever born to its maximum strength or has gone forward without occasional threats of a return to the old order. The cause of the League of Nations today is more vital than at any time since its founding. As President Roosevelt so clearly pointed out in a recent speech, “the old policies, alliances, combinations and balances of power have proved themselves inadequate for the preservation of world peace.” We believe that the alternative to such a procedure is the League machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the present moment there are two currents of public opinion making for closer American relationship with the League of Nations. Since it is a definite policy of our Government to give open cooperation to the League, many citizens wish that this relationship could be regularized and increased by the appointment of an official diplomatic representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also, there is increasing discussion as to the terms on which the United States might become a full member of the League. This discussion has been given impetus by the movement throughout the world for a revision of the Covenant. If such revision were to be undertaken in the light of the fifteen years’ history and with the idea of preserving rather than destroying the democracy of the League, the United States might well participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations Association hopes to demonstrate the strength of these viewpoints in the United States. After you have added your signature to this petition and secured those of your friends, will you return it promptly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Signed) Raymond B. Fosdick,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">President</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN A WORLD AS DARK AS THIS, WHY BLOW OUT THE ONLY LIGHT THERE IS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Community of Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The community of interest between the Federal Council of Churches, the Anglican church (the religious wing of the British government), and the Roman hierarchy is sufficiently established from the reports of the Federal Council herein published, especially those portions which we have printed in italics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only has the pope worked with the Federal Council of Churches to get the United States into the League of Nations, but last fall, when Italy threatened to leave the League, the Vatican newspaper departed from its customary secretiveness, evasiveness and unreliability and openly took a stand on behalf of the League. Most of the nations in the League are nominally Roman Catholic, and the pope figures that any method of bringing the United States under their joint pressure must necessarily work out to the Hierarchy’s advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Fourth Point</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fourth point, that the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System are in league with the Federation of Churches and the Catholic hierarchy, is supported by evidence that, by the time this is in print, will have been presented to Congress, and thereafter we can publish it without violating any proprieties. At this point we confine ourselves to the fact that is known to all men, i.e., that these chain companies broadcast programs of these religious systems without money and without price, are willing to give them more time on the same basis, and will allow only such “religious” material to be broadcast as they approve. This evidence, in detail, will be made available to Congress. At the moment, this is not the place for it in any detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The way matters now stand, to put it bluntly, the international bankers, the backers of the broadcasting systems, the same ones who ruined the United States financially, now decide what “religious” matter may be fed to the American mind, and as blind but dutiful and obedient servants of the Devil, “the prince of this world,” they are looking forward to the time when they can control the whole world. The British government and the Roman hierarchy, financed by these same international bankers, are happy in the anticipation of sharing in the benefits when the United States has been swallowed up in the League of Nations, the Devil’s substitute for the kingdom of God on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Big Business and Big Church crowd that are advertising the League of Nations as “the only light there is” manifestly should know and certainly have no excuse for not knowing that Jesus referred to himself and to the kingdom of God, for which He taught His followers to pray, and of which He is the Head and Representative, when He said, “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12) The League of Nations is in no sense of the word the light of the world, but most emphatically a part of the darkness of this world and under the rule of the prince of darkness, rather than the prince of light and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.”—2 Corinthians 11:13-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">GEOGRAPHIC theater has been organized for the purpose of presenting programs combining motion pictures, lantern slides and native music depicting scenery, customs and peoples of many lands, as well as the findings of scientific researchers working with camera, microscope and telescope, whether under sea, on the earth, or in the air. For the present the programs of the new corporation are being presented in the hotel Waldorf-Astoria. The venture seems to be a commendable one.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Shall Discrimination, Censorship, and Interference of Radio Continue, or a Square Deal?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">(Speech of Hon. Louis T. McFadden, of Pennsylvania, in the House of Representatives, Thursday, March 1, 1934. From the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. McFadden. Mr. Chairman, I want to call the attention of the House to a bill I introduced on March 9, 1933, House Resolution 19, which is pending before the Rules Committee, proposing that the House authorize the appointment of a select committee of seven men to examine into the present radio situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have repeatedly asked the Chairman of the Rules Committee for a hearing on the bill but I have had no response. The country is thoroughly aroused upon this subject, and wants full action at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Likewise, on the 14th of February of this year I introduced a resolution following some remarks which I made on the floor of this House on January 31 last in regard to discrimination, censorship, and interference of radio. Radio broadcasting calls for a “new deal”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“a</span><span class="font6"> fair new deal.” This bill is a fair bill; it deals squarely with the question of politics, religion, and education by radio. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Rayburn, Chairman of the Committee on-Interstate and Foreign Commerce, following the message of the President, has introduced a bill proposing to establish a new bureau called the “Bureau of Communications.” This bill proposes to take from the Interstate Commerce Commission supervision of the radio and put it under the jurisdiction of the new Commission, which will supervise telegraph, telephone, and radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the other end of the Capitol Senator Dill has introduced a bill, S. 2910, quite similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I now call attention to the present censorship, directly and indirectly, in radio broadcasting. The two bills that have been introduced at the instance of the President to conform to his message do not deal clearly with the question of censorship. If the Rayburn-Dill bills are to become law, the subjects covered in my bill, H.R. 7986, should be included therein. The two major chain broadcasting systems have a self-established censorship policy, which includes politics, education, and religion. In this they are attempting to tell the American people what they shall hear and what they shall not hear. The attention of the membership of the House is directed to the fact that these two bills propose that this new commission, when it is organized, shall make a study of all phases of broadcasting and report at the next session of Congress. I say this subject must be dealt with fully now to prevent further entrenchment of selfish interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In remarks I made on the floor of the House on the 31st of January I called attention to the political censorship of radio. During the present year very important elections are to take place; the full membership of the House is to be elected and one third of the Senate. If radio during this summer is to be controlled partisan-ly, it means something to the membership of this House and the country. Likewise the question of international relations will be discussed all during this year, and if this present censorship referred to is to keep off the air broadcasts that are in opposition to their views it means partisanship a plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One phase of censorship which has been set up by the chain broadcasting associations, which control 80 percent, directly and indirectly, of the broadcasting of the United States, is to assume to censor all religious talks that may take place over the radio. The N.B.C. have vested the censorship in the so-called “Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America” under the guise of its religious contribution to the radio audience, whereas it is used as a smoke screen to prevent other programs of wide public interest to be given because the latter may be considered to be inimical to its own selfish interests. This policy applies not only to religious programs but to political and educational programs as well. And they are permitting James J. Farley, Postmaster General and chairman of the Democratic Committee, to censor political broadcasts, and the Columbia System are cooperating in the political censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I submit that the so-called “Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America” do not represent all the God-fearing people in the United States, nor does the Democratic Party possess all the God-fearing people. And the American people have certain vested rights as to what they shall hear over the radio. It is a well-known fact that the so-called “Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America” are working in cooperation with many other organizations in pacifistic movements in the United States, going so far as to voice their cooperation in matters pending before Congress,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">such as their opposition to the recent Vinson naval bill; likewise, their opposition will be voiced against the Army appropriation bill; and at the present time, they are cooperating in the program to have this country join the League of Nations and adherence to the World Court. In fact, this censorship is being used to involve the United States in international affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I hope in answer to a request made of the chairman of the radio committee of the House (which is the Merchant Marine, Fisheries, and Radio Committee) that they are going to give some consideration and a hearing on my bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I want the membership of the House to understand that my bill is necessary, pending the putting into operation fully of the President’s plan as represented by the Rayburn-Dill bill establishing a new commission of communications, and I am now requesting the chairmen of all three committees that they give consideration to the subject covered in my bill No. 7986, which is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A bill to amend the Radio Act of 1927, approved February 23, 1927, as amended (44 Stat. 1162).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</span><span class="font4"> That the Radio Act of 1927, approved February 23, 1927, as amended (44 Stat. 1162), is amended by the addition of two new sections to follow section 28 of said Act (44 Stat. 1172), said new sections to read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No person, persons, company, association, or corporation owning and operating a radio broadcasting station, and receiving and broadcasting radio programs for hire, shall discriminate in the use of such station in favor of a program of speech sponsored by any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office, and/or by any religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association, or society or any other like association or society, and against or to the exclusion of another person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office, or of another religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association, or society chartered or licensed under the laws of the United States, because and for the reason that such, person, religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association, or society holds and promulgates and advocates views contrary to those expressed in programs that have been broadcast. The owner, lessee, or operator of any broadcasting station contracting for or accepting and broadcasting radio programs for one legally qualified candidate for a public office, and for one class of religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association or society, and refusing to contract for or to accept and broadcast for hire radio programs of speech offered for broadcast by another legally qualified candidate for a public office, or by any other religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association, or society within the provisions of this section, because or for the reason that such legally qualified candidate, or such religious, charitable, or educational company, corporation, association, or society holds or promulgates a contrary or different view from that which is expressed by the person or parties broadcasting programs, shall be deemed guilty of an unlawful discrimination. AR persons, companies, corporations, or associations owning and operating a radio station who shall be guilty of a misdemeanor shaU be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000, and in addition thereto may be required to forfeit the license for operating such broadcasting station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No person, persons, company, association, society, or corporation shall by threats, or by coercion, or by misrepresentation, or any other like manner interfere with or prevent, or attempt to interfere with or prevent, the broadcasting of any radio program by any owner, lessee, or operator of any radio broadcasting station; or interfere with or attempt to interfere with, or to prevent any owner, lessee, or operator of any radio broadcasting station from entering into a contract with another person, persons, company, association, society, or corporation, to accept, receive, and broadcast programs of speech and music by radio. No person, persons, company, association, society, or corporation shaU induce or attempt to induce any person, persons, company, association, society, or corporation to withdraw business or financial support or social intercourse from any radio broadcasting station, or the owner, lessee, or operator of any radio broadcasting station in the use and operation of such radio station or in the broadcasting of any and aU programs offered to be broadcast, or which may be broadcast at any such station. Any person, persons, association, society, or corporation violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000, or in the case of an individual or the responsible officials of an association or corporation, by imprisonment for a term of not less than sixty days nor more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The following letter to Judge Rutherford was written by a lover of truth who had KMOX closed to him as a means of hearing the judge's lectures. Boycott, openly published, openly threatened, In the Roman Catholic paper, “The Sunday Watchman,&quot; St. Louis, closed the station tu this listener and to a million others who desired to hear. McFadden, famous for his bold speech on the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, believes In an upright, honest deal for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Appreciation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">St. Louis, Mo. “I have listened to your programs with much joy. For years I have read the Scriptures reluctantly, as I have not been able to get a great deal of meaning out of them. Really I have never been classed as a Bible student, but some of your books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font6"> being the first one, were bought by my wife. She told me about it, but I did not even look at it until perhaps a year or so later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“One day, while alone, I picked up the book, opened it, and it opened at one of the sacred pictures. I became interested and have read and reread your books. I also have read and understood more of the Bible, and had pleasure in it, than ever previously in the fifty-two years of my life. I have claimed to be a Baptist all my life, but I have not been to church for over two years. I sang in the choir, and always tried to enter into the spirit of the worship. My friends tell me that they would not read books that would cause me to stop going to church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Before studying your helpful books I used my radio to get sermons of all creeds, and I thought I was getting a lot of comfort out of them. But now I rarely listen to a discourse; if at all, just for a brief period. I prefer to get my Bible and read it in silence, to try to get the promises understood, rather than to listen to some of the statements made by the ‘learned’ ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“At first, when reading your books, I thought some of your statements were radical; but after further study I deem them true, and, I am sure, classed as radical by those that do not understand. I am reminded of the text, ‘Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.’ I feel that the truth is being unfolded to me and it is freeing me indeed of the vague, superstitious ideas I once held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I find that I speak often and freely of Jehovah God and His promises to my relatives and friends; that is more than I ever did for years. I find there is much to be understood, and I study every chance I get to learn more of Jehovah and His workings for the benefit of man. Ever so often, in speaking to passers-by I am led from the tone of their answers to know they have read some of your works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I am reading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light, Deliverance, Creation, Harp of God, Prophecy, Government,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font6"> Of the two books of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font6"> I am just getting started on Volume I. I am getting an insight into Revelation that I never saw before. Of the several books I have bought I have only four books at home, having loaned them out, and they were never returned. I find one can read one of these books time and again and continually find something new and of interest. I get your programs over KMOX and also from Columbia, Mo.; I do not recall the station designation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I thought you would be glad to hear from some of your listeners in Missouri. I know you cannot answer all reports coming in, but if you have anything I have not read, mention it; I may be glad to read. Your story of Job I have read only once. I am going to read it several times again to get a better understanding of the picture. I may write you later of some of my impressions, and responses from others with whom I come in contact.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Free Radio Essential to People’s Liberties</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font6">ENUINE lovers of truth and of freedom to worship God according to the dictates of one’s conscience are in favor of the exercise of such rights and privileges over the radio. Those who interfere with efforts to preserve such rights and privileges to the people are at once convicted of the charge that they are seeking to steal away the freedom of the people for their own selfish ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The employment of coercive measures to prevent the people from hearing what they wish to hear, and efforts to force them to accept only certain views, which happen to please or serve the purpose of a minority, or even a majority, are contrary to the fundamental law of the land; and what is more, it is contrary to the divine law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The function of proper government, it has been truly said, is not to give the people certain rights, but to secure to them the rights which are naturally and properly theirs. It is therefore the responsibility of those who are the governmental representatives of the people to safeguard the inherent and inalienable rights of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most fundamental and the most important of human rights is the right to worship God without hindrance. Worship must be voluntary and free. It cannot be coerced or exacted under compulsion. The free exercise of the right to worship God is therefore a fundamental necessity. No one could properly worship God who was not persuaded that his course of action was right. Coercion in the worship and service of God is as repugnant to justice and proper human sentiment as it is contrary to consistency. Efforts to coerce the conscience of the individual have constituted some of the most terrible violations of justice and love that have ever been perpetrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Churches Oppose Free Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To safeguard the liberties of the people, and particularly freedom of worship, is the preeminent duty of the American Congress. It is for them to take cognizance of any effort to abridge the liberties of the people to hear, consider and discuss what they please. That such efforts are being made continually in various fields is well known, and, outwardly at least, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others express themselves as deploring interference with the rights of the people. Outwardly and in theory nearly everyone is in favor of free speech. In practice, and inwardly, however, the church organizations and allied interests seek to interfere with freedom of speech over the air and otherwise, and thus abridge the free worship of others. The use of coercive measures to prevent the people from hearing what they wish to hear, and efforts to permit only such views to come to them as happen to be in line with the aims and objectives of a minority, or even a majority, have been made, notably by the so-called “religious leaders” of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A case that is now well known to the people generally is the efforts made to prevent the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s lectures, sponsored by Jehovah’s witnesses, who seek to broadcast the Scriptural explanation of the times in which we live. Judge Rutherford’s lectures are broadcast over hundreds of radio stations and have aroused the determined opposition of the clergy class, particularly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Catholics. They concede that Jehovah’s witnesses have the right to broadcast their views, but at the same time seek to prevent it by coercive means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Criticism of Clergy in Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Their efforts to throttle the Watchtower programs, which feature Judge Rutherford, are “justified” by them in the charge that he has attacked the clergy and the pope. This, however is untrue. Judge Rutherford voices, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">his own, nor any man’s opinions, and does not attack individuals. He deals with timely Scriptural truths and shows their unquestionable application to world conditions at this time. His references to the pope, so bitterly resented by the Catholic press, and misrepresented by them, were not in any sense personal. They were not aimed at the head of the Roman Catholic hierarchy as an individual. It was the official pronouncements and actions of the Catholic </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pope </span><span class="font6">that were being given consideration, in view of a world-wide movement which he sought </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">inaugurate. Clearly the public actions and statements of the Roman pontiff are proper subjects for discussion and criticism in non-Catholic circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is understood that Catholics themselves are not permitted to question any action of the hierarchy or its head, even the most trivial. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font6">is for them to decide whether they will submit to this unscriptural bondage, but it is manifestly intolerable for them to seek to impose these</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">same restrictions upon others or to censor reference to the hierarchy and its head in the press or over the radio. If Paul took the liberty to “withstand” Peter, is the Roman pope, who un-scripturally claims to be a successor to Peter, to be above criticism? The attempt of the Catholic press to subject non-Catholics to the restrictions current within the confines of the Roman fold is a poor piece of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American people, in fact, all people, should be free to hear the truth on every subject, and they should, especially, be permitted to freely discuss and try by the Scriptures any movement or course of procedure in which their cooperation is solicited, as in the case of the so-called ‘Holy Year”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford took occasion to freely discuss and even to criticize the public pronouncements and official actions of the Roman pontiff. It was this one lecture that aroused the already strong animosity of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States to a point where they could no longer keep it under control, and as a result they launched a campaign of misrepresentation and intolerance by which they hoped to effectively silence this frank and bold exponent of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford, following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, sets forth the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in his discourses. He does not shun to declare the whole counsel of God, including the divine disapproval of clerical sham and oppression, just as Jesus did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let Honesty and Truth Prevail</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The petition circulated by Jehovah’s witnesses and others, calling upon Congress to safeguard the right of the people to hear over the radio whatsoever they wish to hear, received a wide response. It manifested that the people want to have the truth told. The clergy, to shield themselves in their inconsistent position before the people, not only have sought to misrepresent and oppose Judge Rutherford, but have also misrepresented the petition which was signed by nearly two and a half million persons. They have branded it as a fraud, and have thus sought to obscure the real issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was charged by them that the name of a Michigan priest was used to induce the people to sign the petition. The absurdity of the charge was pointed out in the preceding issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> It was neither desirable nor necessary to use the name of a Catholic priest and lecturer to obtain signers to a petition for free speech. On the contrary, it would be inappropriate, in view of the traditional attitude of Catholicism toward freedom of speech, or indeed any kind of freedom except freedom to support the Catholic hierarchy, right or wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The necessity of calling attention to Catholic interference with free speech was imperative, and was a responsibility not evaded for policy’s sake or for any other reason. The Petition and Protest states the simple truth, and Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire to represent either themselves or their activities as other than what they are in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In circulating the petition for freedom of the air channels those who engaged in that work were particularly interested in the continuance of Judge Rutherford’s lectures, and frankly so represented themselves. It might have been simpler, and it would doubtless have met with an even greater response, to present the petition merely as a demand for freedom of speech over the radio, without mentioning the notorious example of interference with that right, a factor which would inevitably prejudice some Catholics. The fact that Judge Rutherford was mentioned particularly shows that there was no desire whatever to misrepresent the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Real Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regardless, however, of whether every single signer to the petition realized fully the significance of that document, the question at issue remains: Shall the radio be made the tool of selfish interests, or shall it be the means of frank and open consideration of questions concerning the public interest, convenience and necessity, both materially and spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question is, further, whether any person or group shall be allowed by boycott, threats and other coercive measures to browbeat and compel any citizen or radio station to do anything that it would not otherwise consider doing. Petition or no petition, this is the issue, and it is up to Congress to take appropriate action. Bill H.R. 7986, now before the Congress for consideration, meets the needs of the case exactly, and, if passed, will prevent further interference with the free use of the radio or unjust discrimination against some and in favor of other broadcasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Illumination of Schoolrooms</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE United States Public Health Service has made a study of the illumination of schoolrooms, and makes its findings as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ideal schoolroom is 32 feet long and 23 feet wide, to provide comfortable room for about 30 children. A width of more than 23 feet is not desirable, because the row of seats farthest from the window will not receive proper illumination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The illumination is of great importance. Longcontinued study of natural lighting has shown certain definite fundamental requirements. These are as follows: The windows should extend to as near the ceiling as possible, and the ceiling should never be under 12 feet high. Unilateral lighting is considered to be the best system. This means that the windows should be on only one side of the room, so that the light will come from the left, and these windows should extend as far back towards the rear wall as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every child should be able to see some sky when seated at his desk. The area of glass in the windows should equal at least 20 percent of the floor space. Shades should be provided for each window, two to each window being preferable, the two shades being placed at the middle of the window, so that one pulls up and the other down. It should always be remembered that the best light enters through the upper third of the window.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To provide the best light and to avoid all glare is the ideal plan. The walls of the room should, therefore, be covered with a flat paint. A light buff or cream is desirable. The ceiling should be flat white. Blackboards should be limited to the front of the room and right side. The rear of the rooms should be free from blackboards, and blackboards should never be placed between windows. As a matter of fact, if enough window space is provided, there will not be space enough between the windows for blackboards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">B. Porter, of Connecticut, writes: “A story • of how George Bernard Shaw gained his health and his marvelous physique, and how he maintains them at seventy-four, is told in a recent issue of a popular magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Arthur Brisbane said that George Bernard Shaw has ‘the clearest brain of any person now living’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When a very young man Shaw’s father said to him: ‘My son, I’m afraid I’m a failure. Take me as your guide. Whatever I’ve done, don’t do.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mr. Shaw noticed that his father ate indiscriminately and consumed large quantities of meat; that he smoked all day, drank alcohol, and took no exercise. He noted that most men had the same habits as his father, that they were failures, were frequently ill and died early. He decided to face about and institute a new program for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mr. Shaw ate no meat, shunned alcohol, and gave up tea and coffee. He did not smoke, and he took all the exercise he could. His body ‘gained perfect health, and his brain became clearer and more brilliant every day’. Delighted with this success, he determined to eliminate every possible irritant and poison from his food; so he stopped using mustard, pepper, piquant sauces and the other ‘appetizers’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Being more than six feet tall, and young and active, he grew hungry; so he ‘ate his fill of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and coarse breads, and drank milk. On this diet he has become the world’s wittiest playwright and most brilliant satirist’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Today Mr. Shaw does not appear to be nearly the age that the record shows. He starts his day by chopping wood and by striding vigorously over the countryside with the elasticity and pace of a twenty-year-old. He is also fond of cycling, and knows considerable about boxing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To which we merely add that Mr. Shaw’s clear brain would be still clearer if he gave due honor to the Creator, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. C.</span><span class="font4"> 41'. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saleeby </span><span class="font4">(Reprinted from the London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Xeics) </span><span class="font6">TAOCTORS of the highest rank, such as the ■*-' late Sir William Osler, and, more recently, Sir Humphrey Rolleston, have published their experience, which entirely conforms with that of doctors in general. As a rule, deathbeds are peaceful. During a last illness there may have been much pain and discomfort, distress of body and mind; but, in the vast majority of cases, there is peace at the last. Often the final hours are such as to bring great relief to the patient and even great relief of a kind to those who sorrow for the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are facts of the central nervous system which are apt to mislead the uninstructed observer and which have been systematically used by priests of all religions in times past in order to magnify their office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When consciousness and conscious control are suppressed, as in some kinds of sleep, and during anaesthesia, and near death, and in many kinds of illness, the lower levels of the nervous system are apt to act in a reflex way, and the observer sees movements, perhaps violent or slow, but often contorted and distressing to witness, which look like indications of pain, and even agony, of body or mind. Yet nothing is more certain than the fact that, in such instances, the patient feels nothing whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sole distress is in the mind of the onlooker —unless he or she be an anaesthetist, or nurse, or doctor, who knows quite well that these movements are reflex, such as may be seen for a few seconds or more in the body of an animal already decapitated and certainly incapable of suffering pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The subject is a large and important one, for many reasons; but my concern here is to assert that the so-called death agony is a myth, and is not an agony at all, but is a delusion engendered in the mind of observers who do not understand what they see. And I will add that, only too often and long, men and women have been wrongly made to fear death and the pains of dying, by priests and others who may themselves be deluded by appearances, and are therefore to be pitied; or may not, and are therefore to be despised.</span></p>

He has covered 22,000 miles in this way since June 28, 1930, and plans to cover several thousand miles more before returning to China.

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font6">ROM some advertising matter put out by a savings bank we cull the following which reveals the innate self-destructiveness of the interest system. And yet it is before this interest system that the so-called “great financiers” are casting themselves prostrate and now, in their agony, crying, “0 Baal, hear us!” They have tied up to the wrong god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man went to a bank cashier and upon inquiry was told that an interest account would be opened with as small a sum as one dollar, that interest would be compounded at the rate of four percent once a year, for as long a time as the amount deposited should remain, and in case the depositor died it would be paid to his heirs or any person that he might name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a short time he came back and deposited one dollar and received a pass book. In a few days he brought the pass book back and told the bank officials that he would leave the pass book with them and five hundred years from the day he made the deposit to pay the sum remaining to his credit to his oldest living descendant. In order to make all this perfectly legal and to prevent possible complications among possible heirs, he was told to figure out the amount that would be due at the expiration of the five hundred years and to date a check five hundred years ahead, fill in the amount to be paid and sign it, which would then be attached to the pass book and his instructions carried out to the letter. After a few days the bank officials were astonished when, glancing at the check which their customer had brought in, which had been made out according to their instructions, to see that it called upon the bank to pay some child, five hundred years hence, the sum of $611,527,439.85 (six hundred and eleven million, five hundred and twenty-seven thousand, four hundred and thirty-nine dollars and eighty-five cents). This vast sum in the comparatively short space of 500 years will accrue from the investment of one single dollar when compounded once a year at 4 percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HERE are more people today who worship the golden calf of Mammon than there were when Moses threw down the tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gold, established as a standard, represents wealth, and we bow before it, and seek it with avidity, crushing every opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The horseshoe, or the bolt that drops from an automobile, we would not stoop to gather, nor would we soil our hands with it; yet it has a greater value to mankind than gold or jewels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Deprived of iron, the world would turn back for thousands of years. There would be no steam engines, electric motors, radio, railroads, ocean liners, automobiles, or aeroplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A wagon load of diamonds, for general purposes, would have no more value than a like amount of broken glass; yet nations have gone to war against each other, and thousands of lives have been sacrificed, in the struggle for possession of a single diamond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A string of pearls with a fabulous value, among starving men, could be bought for a handful of beans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We bow to fashion, dare not appear different from our fellow men, and a fad becomes more exacting and drastic than the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the people who cater to our needs we give a bare subsistence, while to those who cater to our fads, follies, and weaknesses are given wealth and honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Edward Bellamy wrote </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Looking Backward,</span><span class="font6"> it was regarded as ideal, but was impractical. When Dr. Sheldon wrote and advocated doing as Christ would, he was a visionary, and unpractical: it was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have turned our Christianity inside out, the false gods rule, and we are eminently practical, taking our lessons from the seamy side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font6">OVERNMENT subsidies to air transport companies have played an important part in building up the present extensive system operating in the United States. The British, while paying a larger subsidy in proportion, are now imitating the plan in operation in the United States, while the Dutch, who are by no means behind in the field of air travel and air transport, have sent experts to study our system of night flying, as have also the Swedes. The United States air lines fly in excess of 150,000 miles daily, almost half of which total is flown at night. During the fiscal year the carriers of air mail were paid a total of nearly $20,000,000 for this service.</span></p>

It climbs 10,000 feet in nine minutes with a full load, and in 24 minutes can attain a height of 20,000 feet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(From a radio address by Sterling E. Edmunds)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font6">UR general law of universal application and our right of appeal to our ordinary courts are gone; and in their place we find more than four hundred federal administrative agencies that have issued and are issuing hundreds of thousands of laws, which they may change overnight, and which no citizen can find in any published compilation, outside of the bureau that issued them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This growth of bureaucratic tyranny may be best seen in the rise of the Department of Agriculture. On August 20, 1787, Gouverneur Morris offered a resolution in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, to incorporate in the Constitution, then being framed, a provision for a federal department of agriculture. It died in committee and was disallowed. Fifty-two years later Congress created an agricultural section in the Patent Office, to gather statistics, with $1,000 appropriated for two employees. Last year, in 1932, this modest section, become the Department of Agriculture, consumed $333,500,000 of our taxes and supported an army of 30,000 federal job-holders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is happening to us today is what has happened to all other republics of history. In the words of Mr. Justice Story, again:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They have perished, and perished by their own hands; prosperity has enervated them, corruption has debased them, and a venal populace has consummated their destruction.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Can we turn back?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer to that solemn question lies in the extent of virtue and capacity for self-sacrifice which remains in the people themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we consider the displacement of the three branches of our government by the executive, and the centralization of their powers in his single person, the chances of self-rescue appear remote indeed. For that is a historical stage in the progress toward the overthrow of freedom, following the tyranny of the legislature, which was foreseen and predicted by none other than Thomas Jefferson himself, in warning us to vigilance.</span></p>

Thirteen of the victims were shot and subsequently burned, eight were hanged and two of these burned, three were beaten to death, two were hanged and shot, one was beaten and shot, and one was beaten, shot and strangled, according to the report of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

<p><span class="font5">“Way we figure this international thing is that we lend nations money to buy our goods. They return the coin for our merchandise. Then, when we go about the business of collecting, they ask why should we pay twice?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Absurd as that sounds, frequent communications from British possessions indicate that just this principle, or lack of it, has been drilled into milions of people till they honestly think it entirely wrong for other people ever to pay America anything they owe. In their eyes the United States is just one big wallet, stuffed full of money and goods of all kinds, upon which the rest of the world may draw ad libitum, but if Uncle Sam wants anything back he is a Shylock and wants to rob honest people of what is rightfully their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unamusing thing about the whole affair is that Uncle Sam not only lost billions upon billions on his own account in pulling Britain’s chestnuts out of the fire, and loaned billions upon billions to Britain, France and other countries, which billions are also for ever lost, but these and other nations are entirely unwilling to repay moneys borrowed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">since</span><span class="font6"> the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only thing they are willing to do is to borrow more, but as soon as they have it safely in their possession they begin throwing rocks as usual, doing all they can to convince the w’orld that a miser has them by the throat and is choking the life out of them. Then the only way to keep them quiet is to lend them some more, on the same terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘Bugs’ has it about right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font6">TREET-BEGGING has assumed the character of a menace to public health. Many of the beggars have communicable diseases, and a large proportion of them suffer from chronic alcoholism. Police in New York city are rounding up the beggars, and one man was found possessed of $25, which he stated had been collected in two days; another had more than a thousand dollars in cash on his person. Many of them are habitual beggars and have made their living in this way for years. The public is urged to discourage the practice by refusing to give money to beggars.</span></p>

It was at first concerned mainly with injustices suffered by members of the Negro race, but it now works for the general advancement and improvement of the colored people.

<p><span class="font6">LTHOUGH the selfishness and commotion of the present time will stifle the possibility of the common people to enjoy many of the recent inventions, I read with interest the following, which show but a few of the blessings man will enjoy shortly, after Armageddon cleans the slate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nonpoisonous illuminating and cooking gas; garage doors opened and closed without getting out of one’s car; porch and garden lights which attract and electrocute insects; gas-, oil- or coal-operated unit which air-conditions homes in summer and heats, ventilates and humidifies in winter; store scales that print weight; pie pans that bake pies already cut into wedges; garterless hose and clothes that will not lose shape through use of elastic yarn; telephone switch that silences radio when receiver is lifted; restaurant tables with tiered tray in center on which meal rises upon checking of menu and dropping in slot; waterproof paper which is tough, flexible, washable, acid- and boiling-liquid-proof; pillow radio loud-speakers which are not heard by others, for use in hospitals and Pullman berths; paper barrels, lighter, stronger and cheaper than wooden ones; flexible cast-iron; aluminum-covered (also porcelain) shingles; liquid coating to make iron and steel permanently rust-proof; filamentless lamp, using fraction of current ordinary lamp requires; new poison (retenone) fatal to insects, harmless to humans and warm-blooded animals; uniform temperature in railway coaches summer and winter; electric razor which uses no blades, brush or lather; electric refrigerators which accumulate no frost; ice, snow and sleet removed from windshields by infra-red rays producing neither heat nor glare; etc., etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Silver Cost of the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Charles R. Fletcher (California')</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TT IS now conceded that the recent terrible war * cost above two hundred and fifty billion dollars!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An American silver dollar weighs one ounce; and is one and one-half inches in diameter; and is one-tenth of an inch thick.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Two hundred and fifty billion dollars weigh 15,625,000,000 pounds, or 7,812,500 tons. To transport such tonnage would require 3,906 trains of forty cars each, or a total of 156,240 cars, each carrying fifty tons. Each train would thus be a third of a mile in length; and the total length of the 3,906 trains coupled end to end would be 1,302 miles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Two hundred and fifty billion silver dollars laid edge to edge in a continuous line would extend a distance of 5,918,560 miles, or over 236 times the circumference of the globe. This amount of silver would be sufficient to belt the earth at the equator with a silver girdle over 29 feet wide and of the thickness of a silver dollar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. This vast sum, if piled one dollar upon another, would reach over 394,560 miles above the base; which is the distance from the earth to the moon and two-thirds of the distance back to earth again. The moon is about 240,000 miles distant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. This vast sum, if drawn into wire weighing thirty pounds per mile, would be sufficient to run six lines from the earth to the sun. The sun is about 92,500,000 miles distant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. This vast sum, if rolled into railroad rails weighing ninety pounds per yard, would be ample to construct a standard-gauge silver-rail railroad 49,321 miles, which is a length about twice the distance around the globe at the equator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. This vast sum, if built into a column ten feet square, would have its top far above the clouds, indeed far above our atmosphere; it would reach an altitude of 325,520 feet, or nearly sixty-two miles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">7. This vast sum, if divided equally among the entire population of the globe, would allow each man, woman and child about one hundred and seventy dollars.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font6">W. Greenwood has been pioneering in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• province of Quebec, one of the coldest localities in America, for the past five years. He sends us the two suggestions which follow, claiming that he has found them both extremely beneficial. They seem odd to us, but may be O.K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lie on the ground face downward, with head to the north. Cover the head if sun is shining brightly; exposing the rest of the body to the sun is beneficial. If weather is cool, spread a blanket down and cover oneself well. The reason this is so beneficial is that the earth is full of electricity, which draws the poison out of the system, recharging it with new vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Arabs, who are noted for their great endurance, when they rest on a long journey, throw themselves upon the ground, flat on their faces. Two or three hours of this repose is worth twice the amount in an ordinary bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Asthma sufferers will often find that severe spasms can be alleviated by following this course, when many other remedies fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• ■ • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cold weather is here for many of us. For those who shrink from the cold, we give a simple way to increase bodily warmth and energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At night and in the morning, or only once a day, take one or two teaspoonfuls of dry flaxseed. Put it in the mouth and drink water to wash it down. It can be chewed if preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead of flaxseed, linseed meal can be used; this is flaxseed ground with a small quantity of other grain (to absorb the extra amount of oil in the flax).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Put in a teacup one or two teaspoonfuls of this linseed meal, pour on it boiling water, and let stand until sufficiently cool to drink. Drink all of it, or, to commence with, only the liquid off the top; all of it is best. Milk and sugar can be added when taken at night. This is often better than the ordinary midnight lunch for many people. See how well you sleep, and how fit you feel when you wake in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Flaxseed is a great heat producer, supplying the same to the body in a most easily assimilable form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(Translated from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Vanguardia,</span><span class="font4"> Barcelona, Nov. 5, 1033)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE existence of a roof of ice at a height of one hundred kilometers over the north pole is one of the most important discoveries of the French expedition which has spent a whole year in Scoresby Sund, to the east of Greenland, making investigations of a scientific character. Members of the expedition, which returned to France only a few weeks ago, have made important revelations concerning their discoveries to the United Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The existence of such a layer of ice had been suspected before, but it appears that the French investigators are the first who have succeeded, not only in proving this phenomenon of nature, but also in establishing its height above the earth. To accomplish this they employed the method of transmission of echoes which ships use in order to measure the greatest depths of the ocean. The ships measure the time that elapses from the report of a cannon till the echo returns to the same ship after having gone down to the bottom of the sea and up again. Knowing the speed of transmission of sound, it is easy to establish by this method the depth of the water. By the same process, the French investigators have made soundings of the atmosphere and have proved that the supposed roof of ice must float at a height of one hundred kilometers above the earth’s surface. This roof of ice is composed of tiny particles of water, infinitely smaller than a drop of water, but in the aggregate forming a layer of compact ice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The French Polar investigators and meteorologists of the expedition believe that this roof of ice plays a very important part in the origin (Spanish says </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">formation,</span><span class="font6"> i.e., formation = genesis or beginning.—H. G.) of storms in the whole of the Northern Hemisphere. Basing their conclusions on their observations (Spanish says ‘notes’), they hope to be able to prove that storms have their origin in the North.</span></p>

J., have been carrying on a two-year fight for the privilege of teaching their children at home, and have at last won out. Among other things, Mr. Smart maintained that the compulsory education law interfered with his rights as a private citizen and insisted on home education for his children who were enrolled in the National League of Mother-Teachers. Inasmuch as vaccination is considered a prerequisite to attendance at public schools, though unlawfully so, the right to teach children through other agencies and means should be granted to parents who realize the danger of vaccination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font6">iLICE records show that during 1933, in cases reported to the authorities, demands by kidnapers totaled a million dollars. The cost of efforts to bring these criminals to justice runs to many more millions.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Traditional Record Not in Scriptures </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Nemo (England)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE following events, not recorded in the Bible, are said to have occurred during the period from the last of the prophets to the coming of Christ, an interim of about 400 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During this period the Jews were influenced by the rule of four different dynasties: (1) The Dominion of Persia, 536-333 B.C.; (2) of Greece, 333-167 B.C.; (3) of the Asmoneans, 167-63 B.C.; (4) of the Idumean Antipater and Herod, 63-1 B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the Persians, whose rule began with the capture of Babylon, the Jews enjoyed great liberty. Out of the form of government that Nehemiah set up came a greater, “The Great Synagogue.” Their duty was to watch over purity of doctrine, especially as regards the Law. The Jewish theory was that the Law was given in a twofold form, viz., the written and the oral. The first, written by God immutable; the second was orally taught to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. This oral Law was repeated by Moses to Joshua, by him to the elders, and they to the prophets till it reached Jeremiah; then through Baruch to Ezra, and he to the Great Synagogue, which Nehemiah supplied with a library of all the sacred books he could collect. (II Macc. 2:13) Our Lord refers to “the tradition of the elders” or oral law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(2) The Dominion of Greece. Alexander the Great came with an army of 35,000 Greeks and conquered all Persia in six years. Alexander was enraged with the Jews for withholding supplies, and only a miracle saved them. This great army was approaching Jerusalem. The high priest offered sacrifice and public prayers for God’s help. In the night God appeared to him in a dream and bid him “cause flowers to be scattered up and down the city, set open all the gates and go, clothed in his pontifical robes, his priests in their vestments, and others in white, to meet Alexander and not to fear any evil from that king, inasmuch as he would protect them”. This they obeyed, marching to a place in full view of Jerusalem, and waited. Alexander was struck at the sight of the high priest, in whose mitre and forehead a golden plate was fixed on which the name of God was written. Alexander advanced with great respect, bowed his body and adored that august Name, and saluted the priest with veneration. The Jews loudly wished him all prosperity. All the spectators were dumb with surprise, and one of the Greek generals asked the king how it was that he, who was adored by everyone, should adore the high priest of the Jews. “I do not adore the high priest,’’ replied Alexander, “but the God whose minister he is, for while I (in Macedonia) was planning how to conquer Asia, this very man, dressed in the same robes, appeared to me in a dream, exhorted me to banish every fear, bid me cross the Hellespont boldly, and assured me that God would march at the head of my army, and give me victory over the Persians.” So Jerusalem was spared, and the Jews gained a great friend, in place of an enemy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Alexander’s death Palestine belonged to one of his generals for a little while, then to Ptolemy, king of Egypt. Under the Ptolemies the Jews were peaceful and happy, were allowed to build synagogues in all their settlements, and this spread them, and their religion, in all their countries. Thus the Greek language gradually became the language of the Jews scattered so, “the Jews of the dispersion” (1 Peter 1:1), and became a connecting link between the Jews and heathens. Then these Jews wanted a Greek Bible, which Ptolemy Philadelphus caused to be written for the library at Alexandria, which became known as the Septuagint, so called because written by about 70 Jews (six from each tribe).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews had a high priest, Simon the Just, who repaired the temple, the walls, and made a reservoir, “in compass as the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After a hundred years of prosperity the Jews became subject to the kings of Syria, in the reign of Antiochus the Great, 198 B.C. They divided the land into five provinces: Galilee, Samaria and Judea, west of Jordan, Trachonitis and Pirea on the east. Judea (between Syria and Egypt, who were at war) became corrupt God punished them—the king of Syria came, plundered the city and temple, and killed many of them, 170 B.C. For 3% years they had no civil or religious liberty. Then God delivered them through the noble family of the Asmoneans. The pious high priest Mattathias and his five sons gained many victories. On their banner was inscribed, “Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Jehovah?” From the Hebrew initials of these words M. C. B. I. was derived their family name, Maccabee. The temple was reconsecrated and a feast of dedication of eight days took place annually. (John 10: 22) Their prosperity was short. Pompey took Jerusalem and made Judea subject to the Romans, finally conquered by Herod the Great of the Jewish reli-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">gion, a favorite of Rome. He enlarged the kingdom, but reduced the power of the high priest. To keep the Jews in subjection he repaired the temple at great expense. In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Herod, while Augustus was emperor of Rome, the Savior of the world was born at Bethlehem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The intercourse of the Jews with Gentiles in Babylon and elsewhere, and the severe chastisements they had undergone, checked their tendency to idolatry, and confirmed them in their own faith. From choice or necessity they settled in Asia Minor, in Greece, in Africa and in Italy, so that when our Lord appeared there was scarcely a country in the whole Roman Empire in which a Jewish colony might not be found. It was therefore true that Moses had, in every city, those that preached him.—Acts 15:21.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Lord Tavistock and Ruskin </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By G. H. Dixson (Oregon)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">’VE just been reading about Lord Tavistock’s humanitarian plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming, as it does, from a titled multi-millionaire, instead of from a Russian Red or an I.WAV., it ought to carry some weight and influence for good among the intelligentsia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many years ago the late John Ruskin, another humanitarian millionaire, by inheritance, suggested this same idea of a national dividend, though differing somewhat in the method of disbursement, possibly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ruskin was a deep student of social and political economy, and a vein of it runs through all his works, which deserve much wider reading. His humanitarian educational efforts will be more and more appreciated as the years go by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I quote a brief paragraph from him on this theme that seems to me quite apropos at this time in the hope that it may stimulate some much needed thought and study along this line, if we are to avert dire calamity. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Suppose it should turn out, finally, that a true government set to true work, instead of being a costly engine, was a paying one, that your government, rightly organized, instead of itself subsisting by an income tax, would produce its subjects some subsistence in the shape of an income dividend! . . . A true government set to true work! Not easily imagined, still less obtained, but not beyond human hope or ingenuity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have immensely improved our methods and abilities in production; isn’t it time we devote more of our time and ingenuity to the improvement of distributive methods ? And is not our monetary system one of the great factors, if not the greatest factor or agency, in distribution?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Quest for World Power</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">(Contributed by Northern European Office of the Watch Tower)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font6">O, WE are not speaking of the imperialistic aims of Germany, Japan or any other world power, but of the title of a very interesting book by Hugh and Margaret Vowles. It deals with man’s quest for new and cheaper sources of power as he ceaselessly endeavors to harness the forces of nature, sometimes to his own hurt. Many an invention has been put to uses the inventor little dreamt of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Quest for World Power</span><span class="font6"> propounds many interesting schemes. One, for example, proposes to obtain immense turbine power by running the sea water from the Mediterranean to the Qattara Depression in the Libyan desert. Into this depression, 7,000 square miles in extent at sea level, forty million tons of water a day, it is estimated, would flow continuously, to be evaporated by the fierce sun, and thereby produce from water turbines an output of 160,000 horsepower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another scheme is for making greater use of the internal heat of the earth. Not only by tapping volcanoes, geysers and hot springs, but water will be pumped down one borehole in the earth, through a reservoir at the base and up another, thus being heated for power purposes. A depth of two miles will give a temperature equal to boiling point at atmospheric pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other schemes include the evolving of a gas turbine, which would revolutionize the production of power from coal and oil, and of a mercury vapor turbine; the development of more efficient heat accumulators; wireless transmission of power; the production of new synthetic materials; the tapping of the energy radiated by the sun by devices in which this is focused on boilers by means of parabolic reflectors or absorbed by special material in long shallow insulated vessels covered with layers of glass with an air space between to prevent re-radiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Great stress is laid, too, upon the harnessing of the tides as a source of power. It is computed by Prof. A. H. Gibson that if a barrage were built across the Bay of Fundy, which has a tidal range of 40 feet, energy equivalent to more than 100 million horsepower hours could be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The authors remark, “Though the importance to mankind of power-driven machinery can hardly be overstressed, we must not forget that, after all, the abiding problems of life are not technical, but moral. . . . With the advent of power and its promise of material plenty for all, there has dawned a new hope in the heart of man that at long last he may escape to wider horizons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, the abiding problems of life are not technical, but moral, and until the disturbing forces of human nature are also brought under control science cannot properly become a handmaid to minister to the needs of man. That is why Japan uses scientific inventions to wantonly destroy thousands of lives in her schemes of selfaggrandizement. That is why time and again the discoveries of science prove a curse instead of a blessing to mankind. Take, for example, the great aniline dye industry. It was a benefaction to the human race, but through misuse it became the basis on which the great explosive industry was built</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No scientist, when actually at work in the laboratory, has the faintest idea of what the ultimate application of his work may be, though he might think so. It is possible that one of the next discoveries will be the release of interatomic forces. That may make possible the propelling of ships across the Atlantic by the release of energy from a piece of matter no bigger than a pea. Now it is clear that mankind is not to be trusted with power of that importance. If mankind had that particular piece of knowledge at its disposal at the present time, it is quite certain that it would use it not only for driving ships across the Atlantic, but also for purposes of destruction, for war, as it has employed all the resources it has hitherto discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Robert Ingersoll once wrote, “Is there to be no change? Are the laws of ‘supply and demand’, invention and science . . . always to be the enemies of those who toil?” Judging from the present condition of the world, with millions hungering whilst the warehouses are full, and crops destroyed because it does not pay to transport them, one might almost answer, “Things will always be the same.” But no— there will be a change, and that change will be in man, because the Lord has arranged for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">New World, when the good things of the earth will be used for the blessing of all. Then it will be possible to entrust man with power, because the administration will be righteous, and because then, and only then, will the dark and disturbing forces of human nature be brought under control.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Last Summer’s Heat in the Land of Sunshine</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AYS Mrs. John W. Wilson, of California: “It was with much interest that we noticed the news item in the last issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font6"> regarding heat in the Imperial Valley of California, where ‘the temperature one day in August was 119, the highest ever reported in that spot’. We are wondering just where ‘that spot’ could have been, as it would have been </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">comfortable location at times from the excessive heat. I live in El Centro, in Imperial Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Believing in giving the Devil his dues I wish to add to the above report on temperature. Many times each summer the temperature rises to over 120 degrees in towns, while in rural sections and on the desert proper 124-130 is acceded to be common; however, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">average</span><span class="font6"> daily temperature is around 115 degrees. These readings are seasonal, and are not extraordinary. Some days and nights the humidity comes in for its glory and hovers around 60-70% for a week at a time; then groaning creation in the Valley is ‘all wet’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To a loyal Californian the weather in California is either perfect or unusual; not having been perfect this summer, it must have been unusual, so it is said that we were blessed with an unusually cool summer—. And this must be as correct as ‘three times one is one’; because our summer weather began about July, and as late as October 27 the temperature registered between 90 and 99 degrees during the day.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Common Salt and Poisoned Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By F. G. Vonderahe </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(.Oregon)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FEW weeks ago I read articles referring to common salt. One of these articles appeared to favor much salt to be used, and the other was against the use of large quantities of common salt. Knowing that there are many doglovers, especially children who have a valuable pet dog, and since poisoning dogs in some neighborhoods is often purposely done by some cruel enemy, I will give what I have found common table salt has done in saving better than ninety percent of the poisoned dogs it was given to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I was a boy or young man on my father’s farm, some years ago, my father’s only remedy when one of our dogs got poisoned was to turn the dog on his back, take a pointed stick, pry the dog’s jaws apart or open, and make him swallow about a full-sized heaped tablespoonful or medium handful of common (not iodized) table salt, and in a few moments after, the dog would throw up the poisoned food it had eaten, arid in a short time recover. I personally know of from twelve to fifteen dogs my father saved in this way, losing only one, which had the poison too long and was entirely too far gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just recently our neighbor’s little dog had been poisoned, and at the time we discovered it he went into one convulsion after another. We gave him a large dose of common table salt, and in less than five minutes he vomited up the poisoned food completely. But this was the most stubborn case of poison I have ever seen, or else he had had the poison so long that his body and blood were so saturated with the poison that it was almost too late to save him, because he still had convulsions one after another for a long time after, which they seldom have after the poison has been thrown out. Nevertheless the dog recovered, and is well as ever today. This happened two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be careful that the dog does not bite you; as they sometimes snap at you when under the effect of the poison. Better wear gloves for protection. And make sure the dog does not eat or swallow the poisoned food again; bury it at once, deep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Beulah J. Heil (Xeie York)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font6">OME time ago I read in an article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> that prepared flour contains phosphates. I remembered seeing phosphates as one of the ingredients of the pancake flour that I used. When I realized what the phosphates might be made of (Cuban cemetery bones), just the thought of such a possibility sickened me of pancakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, being fond of pancakes, I decided to prepare my own pancake flour. Now I have my pancakes once a week, and they are wonderful. We are all so delighted with them that I decided to give my discovery to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font6">readers who like their pancakes once in a while, without depending on phosphates or prepared pancake flours. We eat enough material unfit to cat, but the idea of possibly eating extracts from the bones of some Cuban grandparents is just too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I mixed the following ingredients in this proportion: 1 cup buckwheat flour, 2 cups unbleached flour, 1 teaspoon rye flour, 1 teaspoon corn meal, 1 teaspoon salt, 5 heaping teaspoons baking powder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I make my own baking powder, according to a recipe which you once had in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font6">It is wonderful: 1 part baking soda (bicarbonate of soda), 1 part cornstarch, 2 parts cream of tartar. This baking powder takes from your mind the worry about using aluminum sulphate, which most baking powders contain; also phosphates. Some baking powders contain both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In making the pancakes I add a little brown sugar, milk or milk and water and beat (not stir) to a medium thin batter; then I add soft, almost melted butter, to suit my pocketbook. I think butter makes them better, but they can be made with little or no butter. No eggs are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ultimatum of our family is that these pancakes cannot be beaten. They should be baked quickly on a hot griddle. Maple syrup, or a syrup made of brown sugar, goes best. Honey is fine. We use no corn syrup.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effect of Pasteurization of Milk</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AYS </span><span class="font6">Lieut. Col. C. Maddock, England: “A very interesting observation by M. Ludd, H. W. Ewarts and L. W. Franks, in New York, on infant feeding was carried out for over six months. The infants were divided into four groups. The first were fed on pasteurized milk alone; the second, on pasteurized milk plus orange juice; the third, on pasteurized milk plus orange juice and cod liver oil; and the fourth, on certified milk, which was the only raw milk obtainable in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The percentage gain in weights of these different groups showed that those fed on pasteurized milk alone gained 1.7 percent in weight; with pasteurized milk plus orange juice the gain was 7.9 percent; with pasteurized milk plus orange juice and cod liver oil the gain was 9.5 percent; while those fed on raw milk gained 14 percent in weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The effect of pasteurization on the calcium salts in milk has been studied by H. E. Magee and D. Harvey, working in the Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen. They demonstrated that the calcium in milk is in two forms, a soluble one, and an insoluble one bound up in casein-ogen. After pasteurization the total of the soluble calcium is very much diminished. This loss of soluble calcium, as regards infants and growing children, must be a very important factor in growth and development, not only in the formation of bone and teeth, but also in the calcium content of the blood, the importance of which is now being raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As nature gave raw fresh milk as the only diet for the offspring of all mammals, I still believe that when man steps in and interferes with nature some hardship must ensue, and that it is only a matter of time before research will prove this still more definitely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moths and Borax</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font6">AYS Kate Ronde, of Oregon: “This is the time of year when one can board any street car and smell that smell. Sure enough. A glance around will always show some very genteel lady in some rich material that might have passed for goods bought at some recent clearance sale had it not been for that smell—moth balls. And why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Why? Why, because it is a thrifty lady who cannot throw away a perfectly fine garment just because she or her mother or her grandmother had bought it some number of clearance sales, or maybe new, or a goodly time, before present instant. But it is such good material that it would have passed unseen, unnoticed, unsmelled of, but for that smell, moth balls!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The lady herself smells the smell, too, and looks about sheepishly when other passengers’ blundering glances stare around until they discover her. This takes out all the joy of being thrifty enough to save one’s purse from having to flatten at every clearance sale, or before. Now, how to be thrifty and not smell like it: Don’t use moth balls! Use ‘Mule Team Borax’. Get a ten-cent package of it at any grocer’s. Over every layer of clothing in the trunk, chest, or even pasteboard carton, sprinkle the well-powdered borax, seeing that it gets well into the corners that might make nice moth nests. In the spring all of this white powder, and the great white spots, will completely brush out from the garment; and borax never did smell, anyway. If the goods be a tightly woven serge very stiff brushing is needed to get out the spots. Occasionally the goods may have to go to the cleaner’s; but they invariably come out clean, bright, and smell-less, and moth-hole-less, in the spring, or the fall ”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Earth’s New Overlordship</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE FOURTH chapter of Daniel’s prophecy opens with a proclamation of “Peace!” which appears to be made by the king of Babylon. It was published after Nebuchadnezzar had gone through his humiliating experience of the “seven times”, as stated in the prophecy, and after he had been fully restored to his right mind and was again upon his throne. That proclamation foretold and foreshadowed another and far more important proclamation to be made and issued by earth’s rightful King, Christ Jesus, now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar was not a type of Christ Jesus, he not being devoted to Jehovah God, whereas Christ Jesus was fully so; but he was an illustration of regal or royal power in the abstract, that is, regal power considered apart from any application to a particular person exclusively. He is a symbol of power to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of his proclamation Nebuchadnezzar relates the dream he had had eight years previously, hence after its first fulfilment upon himself. “I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.” (Daniel 4: 5,6) The earthly rulers under Satan, whose regal power is at this point pictured by Nebuchadnezzar, now consult spirit mediums in their efforts to determine what course they should take; but as the magicians failed to give the answer to Nebuchadnezzar, even so the fallen angels cannot now give good advice to earthly rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.” (Verse 7) The magicians, astrologers, enchanters and soothsayers here picture the pope, the cardinals, the clergy, the philosophers and other professed “wise men” of the world who attempt to give counsel and advice to earthly political rulers, but they cannot unravel Jehovah’s purpose, even after He sets the same down in His Word. They shun the Word of God and follow the lead of foolish men and wicked angels. They are unrighteous, and for that reason cannot understand. (Proverbs 3: 32) Therefore the “wiseacres” of the world now throw up their hands and give up the job in despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the heathen “wise men” having failed to interpret the dream, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Daniel. (Verse 8) The fact that he had to send for Daniel to interpret the dream shows that he was obliged to apply indirectly to Jehovah, the God of Daniel, for enlightenment. He could not get it from his own servants, but could receive enlightenment only from the servant of Jehovah God. The name Daniel means “God’s Judge”. Daniel at this point foreshadows Christ Jesus, the great Judge, whom Jehovah has appointed as such and to whom He has ‘committed all judgment, and given him power to execute judgment’. (John 5:22,27) The sending for Daniel corresponds to the time of sending forth Christ Jesus by Jehovah to begin His reign amidst His enemies, and therefore relates to the year 1914. The worldly “wise men” of Satan’s religious, commercial and political organization had completely failed at that time to solve the mystery concerning the human race. God’s use of Daniel in giving the interpretation shows that Jehovah through His chief representative, Christ Jesus, will make known His purpose to the remnant of His faithful servants now on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar then tells the dream: “I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.” (Daniel 4:10,11) The tree towering above the earth pictures in the abstract, or impersonally, the overlordship of the earth together with the organization of the earth beneath it. It therefore pictured a living creation of Jehovah. When God created man and the other animals of the earth He assigned the overlordship of the earth’s creation to the holy cherub Lucifer. (Ezekiel 28:13-15) The position of overlord of man was a very exalted place, and is pictured by the great tree towering high above the earth. This overlordship and its organization beneath is shown to apply originally to Lucifer and thereafter to Satan, in the prophecy of Ezekiel, chapter 31, the fallen Lucifer, Satan, being there addressed as “Pharaoh king of Egypt”. “Lo, a sherbin cedar in Lebanon.”—Ezekiel 31: 3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Lucifer was appointed by Jehovah to the exalted position of man’s overlord he at first exercised that office over only Adam and Eve, so far as the human family was concerned. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">then saw the possibility of extending his regal power over many peoples that should spring from Adam and Eve by reason of God’s commandment given to them to “be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it”. (Genesis 1:28) Greed for selfish gain or “the love of money” moved Lucifer to commercialize mankind. That was the beginning or the root of all evil. (1 Timothy 6:10) Regal power or overlordship, together with the organization under it, there began to expand; and so it is written: “The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.” (Daniel 4:11) That does not mean that Satan was visible, but his power or overlordship was discernible throughout the earth. The overlord supervised all the earth and must be looked up to and recognized by all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The base or root stock of the tree was in the earth, and thus pictured man, and shows that it is the man whom God created, saying: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:26) The dominion of man was and is limited to the earth, but above man was the invisible organization, headed or topped by Lucifer, who afterwards became Satan. Thus “the leaves [of the tree] were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it”. (Daniel 4:12) Even after iniquity was found in Lucifer and he became Satan, all the earth has since been compelled to feed from that “tree”. “The whole world lies under the evil one” (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font6"> The creation of earth has been under the shadow of that wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer, when appointed to overlordship, was a part of Jehovah’s organization, and hence formed a part of the “higher powers”. (Romans 13:1) Lucifer was made God’s watcher over the interests of the things of the earth, but became unfaithful and no longer was a watcher. There was another watcher over and above Lucifer, and this is the one whom Nebuchadnezzar saw in vision: “I saw in the visions of my head, upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven.” This means that the Logos, Jesus, the beloved One and faithful “holy One” of Jehovah, turned His attention to the things which pertain to and affect the earth, and particularly man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Decree</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches.” (Daniel 4:14) That decree means that the right to the overlordship was then and there taken away from Lucifer, now Satan, and that he (Satan) and his spirit subordinates were cut off from Jehovah’s organization and were henceforth outlaws and that no earthly creature was required to remain under Satan’s organization, for the reason that he was no longer any part of the “higher powers” and no more furnishes protection and nourishment and help for mankind. All those who would have the blessings of life must give their allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and His holy Watcher. This divine decree did not mean that at the time of Adam’s sin and of Lucifer’s fall God’s judgment was to be executed immediately and Satan and his invisible organization were cast out of heaven and down to the earth; but that decree declares God’s purpose concerning the same. That decree began to be executed in 1914, when Christ Jesus was sent forth to rule and to cast Satan and his wicked angels out of heaven ; it will be completely executed at Armageddon.—Ezeldel 31:10-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan has exercised overlordship in his wicked organization, which includes the human race, even to the present time; but he has exercised that regal power without divine authority and has rebelled against Jehovah God. Jehovah’s purpose was announced in the decree, but He has permitted Satan to go on in his wicked efforts to prove his side of the challenge flung into God’s face. In other words, Satan has operated by the sufferance or permission of Jehovah. Man has been left to exercise his own free will to serve either God or Satan, and almost all of human creation have yielded to Satan and followed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Stump</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never could it be possible for man to have sustenance and life from that old “tree in the midst of the earth”, because such tree had become wicked and must now be cut down, its leaves shaken off, and its fruit scattered. However, the decree declares: “Nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a hand of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.” (Daniel 4:15) The “stump of his roots in the earth” represented or pictured original man, at first made a part of the organization over which Lucifer was given overlordship. The leaving of the stump signified Jehovah’s purpose to provide an organization or a new tree by and through which obedient mankind might have life everlasting, namely, the kingdom of God with Christ Jesus as the Savior and enthroned King and Overlord of earth’s creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “band of iron and brass” around the stump shows that a long period of time would elapse before the opportunity for the restoration of obedient man under God’s organization would come. In that time period man would be under the restraining rule of wicked spirit creatures, pictured by the copper, or “brass”, and also under earthly rule of imperfect men, pictured by the iron. But while mankind is alienated from God, out in the world (“field”) with no proper habitation, yet God would not permit the race to perish and become entirely hopeless, but it should be kept wet with the dew from heaven, that is, the refreshing promises which could be laid hold upon by those who love God and righteousness. (Deuteronomy 32:2) The whole race would be restrained and bound in a cruel rule, and those who would have faith in God would receive benefit and hope, pictured by “dew”. The stump of the original tree, representing man, and the roots of it in the earth have waxed old, and yet there have been some men in the earth, pictured by the roots, that have scented God’s truth and reached out for it and have clung to Jehovah and His precious promises, and these have promise and hope of being brought into the new tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since man’s expulsion from Eden his portion has been “with the beasts in the grass of the earth”. Rulers under Satan have been bestial, brutish, inhuman, cruel and oppressive, and the human race has been subjected to such cruel rule. These earthly rulers, being a part of Satan’s organization, are likened to ferocious beasts. (Daniel </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7:</span><span class="font6"> 3-17) This is in harmony with the divine decree: “Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.” (Daniel 4:16) The &quot;seven times” must be symbolic of and hence equal to the “times of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Gentiles”, to wit, 2,520 years. (Luke 21:24; Leviticus 26:18, 21,24,28) The whole period of time is ascertained by multiplying the days of a lunar year, 360, by 7 (times), equaling 2,520; and as the Scriptures fix a “day” as a symbol of a year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), the period of “seven times” equals 2,520 years. The beginning of the counting of the seven times must wait until the overturning of Israel’s last king, in the year 606 B.C. From that time the scripture (Ezekiel 21:27) applies which says: “It shall be no more, until he come whose right it is” to have the kingdom and rulership of the world. There it was that Satan became ‘the god of the whole world’ (2 Corinthians 4:4) and the “seven times” began to count; meaning that God would not interfere with the beastly rule of earth until the end of that specific period of time. That period of seven times, beginning in 606 B.C. and extending over a period of 2,520 years, ended in 1914, when Christ was enthroned by Jehovah and was sent forth to rule amongst His enemies.—Psalm 110:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kingdom of Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The decree continues: “This matter is by the decree of the watchers [Jehovah and His Logos], and the demand [the judicial decision, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Strong]</span><span class="font6"> by the word of the holy ones [Jehovah and Christ Jesus, the Logos]; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.”—Daniel 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The words “the kingdom of men” do not refer to the petty kingdoms of Satan’s wicked world, but to the kingdom or invisible lordship set up over man. Jehovah has no responsibility for the national governments of the present wicked world, and certainly not as to who gets into office or is put out of office by the votes of men. Those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah, therefore, can have no part in the selection of such rulers. The fact that Satan has been permitted by Jehovah to continue to exercise overlordship of man is no contradiction of this. The fact that Jehovah directed Jesus to remain inactive and wait until 1914 to begin His work of interference with the enemy proves that Jehovah is “the Most High [who] ruleth in the kingdom of men”, and that He is therefore supreme. In His own due time He delegates His power of rulership to whomsoever He pleases, and He makes known now </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that He </span><span class="font6">has given it to Christ Jesus and that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6">will associate with Christ Jesus in that organization 144,000 others, the true and faithful footstep followers of Christ Jesus, who maintain their integrity to the end. (Daniel 7:13-27) As Jesus said to His followers: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32) These words are not only strong, but conclusive, proof that the giving of the kingdom over mankind is exclusively within the power of Jehovah the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, although the beloved Son of Jehovah, had to suffer humiliation in order to prove Jehovah’s side of the question at issue and in order to demonstrate His own qualification to become the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name. (Hebrews 5:8,9) He was meek and lowly. (Matthew 11:29) “He was despised, and we esteemed him not.” (Isaiah 53:3) He made himself of no reputation and humbled himself even unto an ignominious death, and was therefore brought low. (Philippians 2: 7,8) Therefore in harmony with the prophetic dream it is seen that it pleased Jehovah to ‘set up over it [the kingdom or rulership of men] the basest [the low One] amongst men’. “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Philippians 2:9-11) Jehovah thus fixes the qualifications of the One to whom He gives the Kingdom. The 144,000 associated with Christ Jesus in the Kingdom must possess similar qualifications, and hence these are the low ones of earth whom the Lord uses for His purposes: “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no flesh should glory in his pres</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ence.”—1 </span><span class="font6">Corinthians 1: 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar as Satan’s representative boasted and fell. Self-exaltation led to his fall and complete abasement. (Psalm 138:6) Exaltation comes from Jehovah and is given only to those who are entirely obedient to Him. (Isaiah 57:15) In harmony with this divine rule Ezekiel was caused to write: “I [Jehovah] have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, . . . Exalt him that , is low, and abase him that is high.” (Ezekiel 17: 24; 21: 26) The overlordship of earth is changed, but this change of oyerlordship does not take place until the end of the seven times, which occurred in 1914, at which time Jehovah placed His Son upon His holy hill of Zion and sent Him forth to rule.—Psalm 2:6; 110:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fulfilment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet Daniel faithfully and fearlessly declared the interpretation of the prophetic dream. (Daniel 4:19-27) About twelve months later it began having fulfilment upon Nebuchadnezzar, but in a miniature or small-scale way only. He went stark mad, imagining himself a beast, and was driven out into the fields, where he mingled with the brute beasts for seven years. The major fulfilment takes place on Satan and his organization, reaching a climax with the reign of Christ and the fall of the enemy organization. (Verses 28-33) In the ease of Nebuchadnezzar the “seven times” passing over him were literal; but in the major fulfilment they are symbolic. At the end of these seven symbolic times, to wit, in 1914, the Gentile ruling powers, and particularly that part of it called “Christendom”, were certainly a beastly-looking lot, like Nebuchadnezzar at the end of his “seven times” amongst the beasts of the field; and they went forth and made war upon each other like wild beasts, even as the prophecy foretells. Since then these earthly representatives of Satan have been warned concerning God’s purpose; but they refuse to give heed to that divine counsel and all of them “walk on in darkness”.—Psalm 82: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New Tree</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of the ‘seven years’ of humiliation Nebuchadnezzar appears in a different role. His reason having returned, he now pictures regal power as exercised by Christ Jesus. “And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High; and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.” (Daniel 4: 34) The time limit having been reached, the tree stump must be released from the band of copper and iron. So, down here, the time had come for the inauguration of earth’s rightful King as ruler, and as such He is pictured by one (Nebuchadnezzar) acknowledging and extolling the name of Jehovah and declaring Him to be the Supreme One, besides whom there is none. The restoration of Nebuchadnezzar to the throne was a vindication of Jehovah’s word as announced by His servant Daniel. Likewise at the close of the Gentile times the enthronement of Christ Jesus was a vindication of God’s word as spoken by His holy prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus is the righteous and rightful overlord of earth. His is the capital organization of Jehovah and is therefore the new cedar tree, to which the people must look for hope. “Thus saith the Lord God, I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent [namely, the top of Jehovah’s organization]: in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I the Lord have spoken, and have done it.”—Ezekiel 17:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bands of copper and iron being removed from the old stump of the original tree, no more shall the human race be ruled by wicked spirit and cruel human creatures. The new cedar tree, the righteous overlordship and government with Christ as Head, King and Savior, is made available for all of the human race who will be obedient to God. The One who was lowly and despised of men and of wicked angels is now exalted to the highest place, and thus Jehovah creates a new tree; and enthroning His Son as King and Overlord of man He has thus set up Him who was “the basest of men” in the eyes of others of creation. This new tree is far more excellent than the original tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of good will now on earth, and otherwise designated as the Jonadab class (2 Kings 10:15-23), are pictured in the tender roots in the old stump which, as Job 14:7-9 states, “through the scent of water” reach out after God and lay hold upon the precious truths of His Word and render themselves in obedience to His righteous organization under Christ; and, doing so, they shall live. Into this new tree are first brought the faithful body members of Christ (his 144,000 faithful followers) who are blessed with the privilege of being made a part of the tree or organization that shall administer blessings to the obedient ones of mankind. Under that organization, and as servants thereto, comes the “great multitude” class. (Revelation 7:9-14) The faithful prophets of old were pictured by the tender roots left in the old stump, and because of their faithfulness they will form a part of the new tree; and into that organization shall also be gathered all those of good will who will give themselves wholly to Jehovah God and His righteous government. The new tree is truly a tree of hope. That tree bears the name that Jehovah gives; it is J</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ehovah's</span><span class="font6"> organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In fitting conclusion the king, representing regal power as exercised by Christ Jesus since 1914, says: “Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.” (Vs. 37) Now Jehovah’s witnesses as heirs of the Kingdom with Jesus do also “praise and extol and honour the King of heaven” and delight to bear His truths to the people. His truth and judgments are now being made known in the earth and must continue to be made known until all shall know that Jehovah is the Most High over all the earth and that all those like Satan, who continue to walk on in pride, Jehovah is able to, and will, completely abase and destroy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horton, Mich. “I am writing to tell you of the thrilling pleasure I received from hearing Judge Rutherford this morning over W1BM, Jackson. It was the first time I ever had that privilege. We got our radio only yesterday morning and could scarcely wait until time for him to speak. It has been something over a year since I first heard of the Watch Tower and began reading Mr. Rutherford’s books. Along with the books was sent a booklet tell</span><span class="font6">ing about your organization and also about the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> magazines, for which I want to thank you very much. I am now a subscriber for both and would gladly give up all the other papers and magazines we have rather than part with these. I have been more or less of a shut-in the last two or three years, but perhaps for that reason I appreciate all the more the glorious truths about Jehovah God. A curious coincidence happened, or so it seemed to me. About a half hour after the lecture one of Jehovah’s witnesses called at the door. I do not know of any about here, but I assure you I am in sincere sympathy with your great work and if at any time in any way I can be of assistance I will be glad to help. May Jehovah bless you.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark42"></a>IN ONE WEEK 91,018!</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark44"></a>That’s how many copies of Judge Rutherford’s latest book, PREPARATION, were distributed in the United States alone.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">SPECIAL record was kept of the distribution of this book on November 20-28 of 1933. During these nine days there were 91,018 copies of PREPARATION placed in the hands of the American people. Since then hundreds of thousands have been placed in the United States, Canada and England, as this book travels on towards an unprecedented distribution. Probably a new high record for Judge Rutherford’s writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you do not already have a copy of this 384-page book, which is beautifully illustrated with colorful, meaningful pictures, then be sure to write immediately to The Watch Tower for a copy, for it will bring to you a clear-cut, easy-to-understand description of the present wicked organizations that are oppressing the people today ; how these great governments are preparing for the most terrible war, which is just ahead. The Bible terms this as the preparation preceding the battle of that great day of God Almighty, which is Armageddon. There are two forces preparing—that of the Devil’s organization against that of the Lord’s organization which we know will gain final victory. This war will end all war. Never have you read such an interesting and descriptive picture of a conflict, which, when completed, will mean righteousness, peace and prosperity to those who have taken their decided stand on the side of Jehovah, the only true and living God. Don’t miss it! It is a thriller. It is the truth. It is something you must know before the final end. Write now for your copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another country, where only ten million people live, this book mentioned above reached the tremendous distribution of 7,046 in the nine days of November 20-28. It is not only the people of the United States that are interested in the Lord’s message which Judge Rutherford is so clearly presenting to the people, but those of good will, wherever they live, are seeking to know the truth. In fact, more than 150 million copies of Judge Rutherford’s books are now in the hands of the people, and this accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses in twelve years’ time.</span></p>

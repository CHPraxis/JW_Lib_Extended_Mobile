<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A Protest and Petition Fifty Feet High</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">To THE CONGRESS of the United States of America!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Greetings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We, undersigned people of the United States of America, capable of determining for ourselves what we wish to hear broadcast by radio, without censorship by the clergy or anyone else, hereby PROTEST to the Congress against certain wrongful Interference with our rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The radio act provides, as we understand, for the broadcasting of that which Is In the public Interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The message of the true God, JEHOVAH, as expressed by Him In the prophecies of His Word (the Bible) and as now being given to the people of this nation by Judge Rutherford and others of JEHOVAH’S witnesses, Is of Interest to us. When broadcast, It la convenient for us to hear It In our homes and Is necessary</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19340214_files/g_E_19340214-2.png" alt="" style="width:223pt;height:364pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">for our welfare. We are entitled to hear and desire to hear that message. We disapprove of every attempt to prevent our hearing It broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and others, have wrongfully by threats, coercion and other Improper Influence prevented many stations from broadcasting this message of truth, thus depriving stations of legitimate Income and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear; and against this wrongful action we vigorously PROTEST.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Exercising the right guaranteed to us by the Constitution of the United States, we therefore respectfully petition the Congress to act at once to safeguard the Inherent rights of the American people relative to the radio.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">“But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue.’’—Esther 7: 4. (Imprisonment is Preferable to Censorship—Strangulation)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">rPHE morning of Wednesday, January 24, J- 1934, there was placed in the hands of Congress the foregoing protest and petition bearing 2,416,141 signatures of fellow Americans. Before being tightly wrapped for transmission from Brooklyn to Washington the sheets of signatures (25 signatures to a sheet) comprised a pile fifty feet high. After being tightly wrapped the pile, by actual measurement, was over 41% feet high. To transmit this protest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">and petition to Washington required thirty-five closely-packed cartons, each measuring on the inside 15 x 12% x 11% inches. The shipment weighed 1,247 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nothing Like This in History</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A careful search of records of the Brooklyn Public Library fails to reveal that any petition remotely approaching this in magnitude was ever before presented to the American Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1910 the National (Woman Suffrage) Association presented to Congress a petition of about half a million names for a federal amendment granting woman suffrage. This seems to have been the largest previous petition on record.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The details of the signatures in each Congressional District have been made available and would be interesting to many, but perhaps it will suit the majority to merely mention that the two highest records were in Cleveland, where four districts yielded 108,862 signatures, and in Los Angeles, where eight districts yielded 143,088 signatures. This was all done in six weeks; had the time been doubled, the record also would have been doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Care was taken that the signers for each Congressional District were provided with petition blanks suitable for their own district. Each Congressman, on January 24, was personally handed the petitions from his own district This work was entrusted to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The letters of transmittal which accompanied the petitions were, wherever possible, from “Jonadabs,” well known men in their own districts. For example, the letter of transmittal to J. Howard Swick (Rep.), Representative of Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania District, was signed by Hon. George T. Weingartner. His letter to Mr. Swick was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Sample Letter of Transmittal</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Congressman Swick :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In behalf of myself and many others of your constituents of the Fifteenth Congressional District of Pennsylvania I beg to call your attention to the attached petition signed by a number of them which demands that Congress take immediate action to safeguard the interest of the people against the unwarranted action of certain entrenched selfish interests. The two big radio corporations, acting together with certain other selfish interests, including religious organizations, are employing threats, coercion and boycott methods to compel many radio stations to broadcast programs only that are approved by these selfish interests. Attempts are made also to influence the Radio Commission along the same line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Radio stations should be given the same privileges that are now enjoyed by the public press, and every radio station should be permitted without interference to broadcast any lawful programs that they may choose to broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A heavy penalty should be laid against all persons or corporations that attempt by coercion or other wrongful methods to prevent the broadcasting of programs that are of public interest, convenience and necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your constituency will confidently expect you to present to Congress at the proper time and earnestly support this petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">George T. Weingartner</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Congressman Swick Takes the Floor</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Wednesday, January 24, Mr. Swiek addressed the House of Representatives on the subject as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hr, Chairman, I have today filed the following petition, bearing the names of 10,264 residents of my district, divided as follows: Beaver County, 4,769; Lawrence County, 3,242; and Butler County, 2,253. The Petition was accompanied by a letter of transmittal from the Honorable George T. Weingartner, 504 L. S. &amp;&nbsp;T. Building, New Castle, Pa., a man who has served his county and State as a commissioner and State senator for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(The Petition was then read to the House)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Chairman, I understand that similar petitions have been received by several members of this House, all of them bearing the signatures of thousands of American citizens. It is certainly evident that something is wrong; we cannot ignore such charges. Each of these petitions has been referred to the House Committee on Merchant Marine, Radio, and Fisheries. I hope the chairman of that committee will recognize the rights of these petitioners and conduct an investigation of the charges, and if these conditions prevail, that legislation is forthcoming that will correct them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would be derelict indeed if I failed to present a matter of sufficient importance to have received the signatures of more than 10,000 residents of my district to this Congress. It is of importance to all concerned that this matter be thoroughly investigated at a very early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the following day twenty-five more Representatives presented the petitions that had been handed to them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">William A. Ayres, (Dem.), Fifth District, Kansas Frank H. Buck (Dem.), Third District, California Peter A. Cavicchla (Rep.), Eleventh District, New Jersey Charles J. Colden (Dem.), Seventeenth District, California William P. Connery, Jr. (Dem.), Seventh District, Massachusetts George A. Dondero (Rep.), Seventeenth District, Michigan Hamilton Fish, Jr. (Rep.), Twenty-sixth District, New York Philip A. Goodwin (Rep.), Twenty-seventh District, New York William E. Hess (Rep,), Second District, Ohio John B. Hollister (Rep.), First District, Ohio Joseph L. Hooper (Rep.), Third District, Michigan Magnus Johnson (F.L.), Minnesota at Large J. Roland Klnzer (Rep.), Tenth District, Pennsylvania Leo Koclalkowski (Dem.), Eighth District, Illinois Carl E. Mapes (Rep.), Fifth District, Michigan Schuyler Merritt (Rep.), Fourth District, Connecticut Theodore A. Peyser (Dem.), Seventeenth District, New York Frank R. Reid (Rep.), Eleventh District, Illinois George N. Seger (Rep.), Eighth District, New Jersey Joe L. Smith (Dem.), Sixth District, West Virginia Malcolm C. Tarver (Dem.), Seventh District, Georgia George B. Terrell (Dem.), Texas at Large Chester Thompson (Dem.), Fourteenth District, Illinois Zebulon Weaver (Dem.), Eleventh District, North Carolina John Davenport Clarke (Rep.), Thirty-fourth District, New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Dondero cited the protest “against wrongful threats, coercion, and other improper influence preventing many radio stations from broadcasting the message of truth and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear, and particularly the message of Judge Rutherford”. Similar expressions appear in the presentations of Mr. Smith, Mr. Tarver and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Letter from Washington Representative</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Letters of transfnittal from their own districts were not in all instances provided, and so, to make sure that every Senator and Representative would see and grasp the full import of the protest and petition placed in his hands, Anton Koerber, Washington representative of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, under date of January 25, 1934, sent each of them the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certain entrenched selfish interests, including the National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting Company, and the Catholic church organization, are attempting to control radio broadcasting in America and to cause to be broadcast only such radio programs as such selfish interests may approve. If this can be properly done, then one political power may silence all persons who desire to express by radio their views on matters in which the people are vitally concerned. Congress should take appropriate action to prevent just such a thing coming to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American people have the Constitutional and inherent right to worship God as they may choose and to hear whatsoever may aid them in the understanding of the Holy Scriptures, as well as other matters of public necessity and convenience. That the matter might be called to your attention a petition, a copy of which is attached hereto, has been signed by American citizens of the various states to the number of 2,416,141 persons. The numerous sheets containing signatures to this petition have been separated according to districts and states and are now in the hands of the various members of Congress. In accord with the spirit of this petition we demand that all interference with the freedom of worship of Jehovah God and of the study of God’s Word, the Bible, and all interference with radio stations broadcasting programs pertaining to the same, cease; and that this Congress by legal enactment make it unlawful for any person or corporation to use threats, boycott or other coercive methods to interfere with, interrupt or prevent any radio station from broadcasting any and all programs that may be deemed for the good of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At any time when we are requested so to do we will furnish the proof before Congress that the above organizations have prevented radio stations broadcasting proper programs and that they have used threats, boycott and other coercive methods to accomplish that wrongful purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Respectfully submitted, </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anton Koerber</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Washington Representative </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“All Things Are Now Ready”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a Congressional hearing is provided, adequate reasons will be presented as to why the protest and petition mentioned the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System. This is limited to a brief statement respecting the press of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which has ‘'wrongfully by threats, coercion and other improper influence prevented many stations from broadcasting this message of truth, thus depriving stations of legitimate income and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Catholic Register”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">June 15,1933, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register,</span><span class="font7"> Kansas City, Mo., diocesan weekly, said, “Every radio station that broadcasts these Rutherford talks is running a serious risk of losing its license to broadcast.” The issue of July 6 said, regarding the issue of June 15, “A marked copy of that issue was sent to each station in western Missouri and Kansas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Accompanied by heavy collateral pressure the frightened radio managers began to yield, hence </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Register,</span><span class="font7"> in its issue of June 22, said, “Immediately upon seeing a marked copy of last week’s issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register,</span><span class="font7"> the [WHB] contract was cancelled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same issue, after having explained to their readers how to go about it to secure the breaking of contracts, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font7"> said, “Where the station owners object to the financial loss incurred by breaking the contract, they should be made to understand that they stand to lose a great deal more by putting this speech on the air.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though resorting to the use of politicians and officials of the Knights of Columbus in personal calls upon radio-station owners to induce them to cancel their contracts to broadcast the Watchtower program, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font7"> speaks, in its issue of July 13, of “a broad spirit of tolerance”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same issue, where one radio station manager said, in an effort to avert the wrath which he saw was impending, “We will consider it a pleasure to broadcast addresses or services from the Catholic church here at no cost,” his statement was published and immediately followed by the statement of a member of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font7"> staff that his “letter is just one mass of lies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same issue of July 13 contained the following editorial statement: “Wherever a vigorous fight by a well established Catholic paper has been made, the radio stations have thrown out the Watchtower programs. In fact, every such cancellation thus far can be directly traced to the initiative of the Catholic press. This is Catholic Action in reality as it affects every Catholic man, woman and child, and no more forcible argument for the support of the Catholic Press could be offered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Catholic Union and Times”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and “The Evangelist”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Union and Times,</span><span class="font7"> Rev. Luke F. Sharkey, editor, is the diocesan publication of the Buffalo (N.Y.) diocese. It is published on Thursday. On the following day, Friday, July 14, 1933, a dispatch from the Buffalo paper is quoted in the editor’s forum of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Evangelist, </span><span class="font7">Albany, N. Y. Just a word about </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Evangelist.</span><span class="font7"> Its editor in chief is Rev. John J. A. O’Connor, its assistant editor, Rev. Wm. H. Taaffe, its question box editor, Rev. John J. Collins. The board of directors includes the Most Rev. Edmund F. Gibbons, D.D. (president), Rt. Rev. Msgr. Jos. A. Delaney, V.G. (vice-president), Rt. Rev. Msgr. John F. Glavin (treasurer), and Rt. Rev. Msgr. Wm. P. Fitzgerald, V.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sentences from the matter are quoted from the Buffalo </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Union and Times: </span><span class="font7">“The reputation of Rutherford smells to the high Heavens—a stench in the nostrils of millions who own the air waves by prior right. . . . Rutherford is just another mental pigmy with the mind of a maggot and the heart of a buzzard, who tried to coin boodles out of bigotry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following week, in its issue of July 21, 1933, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Evangelist</span><span class="font7"> was able to announce, in a front-page, glaring headline, that “Station WOKO Drops Rutherford Programs”, and that the station’s letter containing the decision “was in answer to a protest voiced by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Evangelist”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Catholic Universe Bulletin”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> Cleveland, Ohio, is another diocesan organ. In the year 1933 it took occasion to refer to Judge Rutherford, the president of the International Bible Students Association, by the use of the following appellations: “advocate of civil and religious anarchy,” “antichrist,” “blind leader of the blind,” “child of Balaam,” “deceiver,” “de-famer,” “deliberate falsifier,” “disturber,” “human canine,” “intellectual pervert,” “intolerable bore,” “liar,” “loud-talker,” “slanderer,” “unsent messenger,” “ventriloquist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Desiring to set before their readers Judge Rutherford’s qualifications, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> in the year 1933, described him as “ambitious”, “audacious,” “bigoted,” “bold,” “calculating,” “careless,” “cheeky,” “cool,” “cunning,” “egotistic,” “extolling himself,” “fanatical,” “hypocritical,” “ignorant,” “insufferable,” “notorious,” “obnoxious,” “of doubtful sanity and coherence,” “querulous,” “raving,” “self-appointed,” “self-assertive,” “self-centered,” “self-sent,” “wise in his own conceits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wishing to express their opinion of his addresses and of his books, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> in the year 1933, referred to them as “blasphemous”, “cheap,” “contradictory,” “dirty,” “distasteful,” “higgledy-piggledy,” “insulting,” “most vile,” “obnoxious,” “offensive,” “scurrilous,” “seditious,” “sickening,” “silly,” “slipshod,” “vicious,” “untruthful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not being just satisfied that the matter should rest merely on an adjectival or adverbial basis, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> in the year 1933, referred to Judge Rutherford’s efforts to honor the name of Jehovah God and bless his fellow men as “affront”, “assumed innocence,” “bigotry,” “deceitfulness,” “diatribes,” “discord,” “disunion,” “false vision,” “hot air,” “intentional misapplications,” “lying divination,” “malice,” “nothing but assurance,” “nuisance,” “pretense,” “twaddle,” “untruth,” “virus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides the foregoing in the year 1933 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> also contrived to convey to their readers the thought that Judge Rutherford has a devil, that he bewilders, misleads and unsettles, that he glories in his shame, that he insults directly, that he harangues his fellow bigots and nails his fellow citizens to the cross of intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Bulletin” Believes in &quot;Freedom of Speech”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps it is not necessary for us to say that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> while most insistent that Judge Rutherford should be removed from the air, nevertheless believes in full freedom of speech for priests. We append a few of its expressions, mingled in with the foregoing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Tfte </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> never for a moment contends that in the United States, where Church and State are divorced, the ether waves should be denied any religious groups for the direct presentation of their views.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘It is not the policy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> to object to other creeds making use of the air to propagate their beliefs. Such procedure would get nowhere in a country dedicated to the principles of religious freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘We yield to none in our desire for liberty of speech.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Our point is not to keep Judge Rutherford as such off the air but to keep Judge Rutherford off the air when he insults our religious feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We preach, and we think we practice, tolerance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the opportune time there will be shown the full record of the conduct of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> and of the Catholic press in general, and it -will be disclosed how their conspiracy formed at Chicago in the latter part of June is working out to the vast injury of the American people as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Notice </span><span class="font7">I The petition as sent contains the signatures of many thousands of good Catholics who are true Americans and who do not at all approve the steps which these priests are taking to rob them of the privilege of listening on the radio to Judge Rutherford or to whomsoever else they please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We urge that at this point you read and consider Judge Rutherford’s manly letter to the Catholic press of America, which appeared in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> No. 363, and reappears in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Haman Built His Own Gallows</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until the Roman hierarchy took a hand in it, the right of free speech over the radio was not questioned in the United States. On Saturday night, June 24, 1933, there met in the Stevens Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, twenty-eight persons dressed in clerical garb and twenty persons dressed otherwise. They form the Catholic Press Association, summoned by the hierarchy with the definite intent of finding a way to choke Judge Rutherford, cut him off the air, put an end to him, as a witness of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The result of their deliberations was a plot to coerce every radio station that could be coerced to cancel its contract, and at the same time to flood the Federal Radio Commission with protests and petitions to have Judge Rutherford’s talks banned in the United States as in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They asserted, and circumstances bear out their assertions, that the Protestant clergy were with them in the conspiracy to prevent this man of God from saying to the people what Jehovah God has bid him say. For a time they seemed to succeed. At present it looks as if they bid fair, in the final analysis, to be at the wrong end of the rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be remembered that Haman built his own gallows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sirs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just now on my return from Europe I find that in my absence your papers have inaugurated a campaign to prevent the American people from hearing the truth of Jehovah God’s Word which it has been my privilege to tell them for some time. You make me the scapegoat in order to thus deprive the people of the opportunity of learning at this time the very things that they should know, to wit: That Jehovah is the Almighty God; that Christ Jesus is His anointed King; and that the worship of man is an abomination in the sight of God; and that the kingdom of God under Christ is the only remedy for suffering humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This letter I am addressing to you jointly and severally because the charges in your papers are similar and show that you are acting in concert. I have hopes that there may be at least one fair-minded editor among you who will publish this letter that your numerous readers may hear both .sides of the case. Your failure to publish this letter will be unfair to the public and may compel me to get this information to the people in another way. Newspapers should publish the truth, if for no other reason than the fact that they accept money from the people for subscriptions upon the implied contract at least that they will publish the truth. The publication of only a small part of the truth is much more unfair than to make no publication at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">EX-CONVICT STORY:</span><span class="font7"> You have attempted to belittle me in the eyes of your readers and thus to do injury to the message I have spoken by charging that I am an “ex-convict”, which charge is untrue. A convict is one who is guilty and is convicted of a crime. When the judgment of a law court is reversed and the case is then dismissed the man against whom the judgment was rendered is exonerated and he is therefore not a convict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Briefly I refer to the facts that you may recall what you should already know: The clergy have hated me for years because I have followed the lead of the Lord Jesus Christ and told the people the truth only as He taught it. A number of those men wanted to kill me, and they attempted to find some legal means by which they could accomplish their wicked purpose. The World War seemed to furnish them an opportunity. Shortly after the United States entered the war a convention of clergymen assembled in Philadelphia, laid out a plan of action, and then selected and sent a committee to Washington to carry out their wrongful purpose. They presented a petition to a committee of the United States Senate demanding that the Espionage law be so amended that the trial of alleged offenders must be held before a military court and that the penalty to be inflicted must be death. President Wilson disapproved of their course and the Senate did not amend the law as the clergy desired. A general of the United States army, in the presence of two witnesses besides myself, told me the above facts and then added: “But they are going to get you at any rate.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">296</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In the spring of 1918 the clergy and their allies “framed” a case against all the officers of our Society, including myself. I was charged with the publication of an objectionable paragraph in a book which I did not write and which was written and published before the United States entered the war and before the enactment of the Espionage law. Upon this and other illegal testimony, and at the direction of a prejudiced judge, and during the excitement of the war, a jury returned a verdict of guilty and we were sentenced each to eighty years in prison. A Catholic judge denied us the privilege of bail, which the Constitution guarantees we should have, and we were immediately landed in prison. My attorneys prepared a brief setting forth 125 errors in the record of that trial. When the case was presented to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States upon an application for bail Justice Holmes immediately admitted us to bail. The case was then heard by the appellate court, and the judgment reversed and remanded. Because of the gross outrage practiced upon me and my brethren three United States senators and two other prominent American lawyers volunteered to defend me at the next trial. Shortly thereafter the Government dismissed the case and we were thereby exonerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But for the sake of the argument, suppose I were a convict according to your definition. Would that be cause to reject the truth of God’s Word which I am proclaiming? Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s greatest witness, was a “convict”, wrongfully charged and convicted of the crime of sedition, and His conviction and death were procured by the clergy of His time; and which wrongdoers find their counterpart in the clergy of the present time. I am delighted to be permitted to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and to be in the same class where the clergy placed Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your papers try to convey to the public the thought that I attempted to hide the fact of this unlawful trial and that you had kept it alive by pigeonholing the facts at the time and now brought it forth. You ought to know better than to try to put over such a falsehood on the people. The clergy thought that court experience above related would finish me for ever. But they were doomed to disappointment. Immediately following my release I visited every large city in America and by full-page advertisements in the largest daily papers invited the public to come and hear. The advertisements amongst other things said: “SENT TO PRISON FOR EIGHTY YEARS BY THE CONSPIRACY OF THE CLERGY —COME AND HEAR THE REASON WHY.” The people crowded out every great hall and theater where I spoke, thousands being turned away. That persecution by the clergy had much to do with advertising our work and enabled me, no doubt, to write and cause to be placed in the hands of the people more than 140 million books since that time, which books contain the message of God’s kingdom and which are published in 58 different languages. You are welcome to all the satisfaction you can get out of that “ex-convict” story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">RADIO:</span><span class="font7"> Because in a recent radio address I stated the plain truth for the benefit of the people, your papers, at the instance of Catholic clergymen, began a vicious campaign to “silence” me. Vigorously you say, “Rutherford must be muzzled; he must be silenced; put him off the air.” With the hope of accomplishing that end you and your associates inaugurated a campaign of coercion against radio stations. You threatened to boycott these stations, to cause building contracts and paint contracts, and many other contracts, to be cancelled, and to use every means within your power to injure the stations and their clients financially. All fair-minded men and women must and do condemn your course of action and your mode of procedure which is entirely un-American and unfair. The people are entitled to know the truth. If I have stated falsehoods against your organization, then it is your duty to show the people wherein the statements made by me are untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It appears that the Catholic clergymen have no weapon of defense except a gag and a bludgeon. Every man who speaks the truth, which truth does not tingle the ears of the clergy, the Catholic clergy say should be gagged. Every one who publishes the truth contrary to their ideas of what is right the Catholic clergy say should be browbeaten, coerced and clubbed into submission. God and Christ Jesus never employed any such methods, and that of itself is most conclusive proof that men who resort to the gag and bludgeon method do not represent God and Christ. Such methods used to keep the people in ignorance and to blind them to the truth are the ones employed by Satan the Devil. (2 Corinthians 4: 4) When a man, whether a clergyman or the editor of a newspaper, resorts to the gag and bludgeon method, whom then does he represent, God or the Devil? Judge ye!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The gag and bludgeon method employed by you and the clergymen of your organization frightened a few radio stations into submission and caused them to cancel their contracts. Out of the numerous radio stations in the United States used by me to broadcast the truth you succeeded in inducing ten stations to cancel their contracts. That is a rather good record in America for your method of procedure. If you had a Roman Catholic in the office of president of the United States now you would browbeat every radio station in the land into submission. Thank God your intolerant organization has never been able to place one of your organization in the office of President of the United States. The more the American people learn about you and your unjust methods, the more they shun you; and you know that to be true, and that is why you employ the gag and bludgeon. There are millions of good Catholic people who heartily disapprove of your unrighteous methods of suppressing the truth, and of this 1 have positive knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">SLANDER:</span><span class="font7"> You charge me with attacking men with slanderous speech. That charge is wholly untrue. Never have I delivered a radio speech or other public address in which I have attacked any man. I have called in question the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">doctrines </span><span class="font7">men teach to the people; and if that is not permissible, then the people would be compelled to hear only what your side has to say, regardless of how untrue your statements are. That is another proof of your coercive and bludgeon methods. I have no quarrel with any individual and no occasion to attack personally any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You claim to believe the Bible and to teach it, and therefore you are bound by what the Bible says. The Bible says that Jehovah is the only true God, and that Christ Jesus His beloved Son is King; that Satan the Devil is the opponent of God, and that the Devil resorts to fraud, deceit, coercion and bludgeon methods to blind the people to the truth. Men are either servants of God or servants of Satan the Devil, and by the fruits or doctrines which they carry to the people it is to be determined whom they represent. It is written in the Scriptures: “Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Romans 6:16) In harmony with this Jesus states: “He that is not with me is against me”; and that is true whether the one be a priest or a layman. (Luke 11: 23) Again: “If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” (Romans 8:9) Christ never employed coercive, gag or bludgeon methods to accomplish His purposes. When men employ such wrongful methods, contrary to Christ, then they prove that they have not the spirit of Christ, and that they are not His servants but that they are servants of the enemy of God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is true that the “spirit of Christ is love”, but that does not mean that He loved wickedness and that He stood by and saw pious-faced hypocrites proceed to deceive the people, and remained silent because He might “offend the sensibilities” of the clergy or some of their allies. Read the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, wherein Jesus denounced the clergy of His day in the most scathing language that has ever been applied to any creatures. He was speaking to men then who posed before the people as the representatives of God, and He plainly told them that they were hypocrites. Love, which is the spirit of Christ, means an unselfish effort put forth to do good to others and to honor Jehovah God. It does not mean to consent to the name of Jehovah God’s being defamed. The mere fact that a man bears the title of clergyman or priest is no evidence that such a man represents God or Christ or that he speaks the truth. In proof of this, note the words of Jesus addressed to the clergymen and priests of His day who denounced Him for telling the truth. He said to them: “Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God. . . . Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">father the devil,</span><span class="font7"> and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speak-eth a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:40-44) The Scriptures then show that exactly a similar condition would exist at the end of the world, where we now are, and that clergymen would boast of their own goodness and greatness and defame God’s name and persecute humble men and women who attempt to tell the truth.—See John 15:19,20; Mark 13:9; 2 Timothy 3:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should the people be denied the opportunity of learning what God’s Word teaches, merely because those divine truths when uttered “offend the sensibilities” of certain men who are not in harmony with God? I agree that one man has no right to attack another man personally; but when any man brings forth a doctrine relating to God’s dealing with the human race and asks the people to believe that doctrine, then it is the right and duty of others who do not agree to call attention to the fact that such doctrines promulgated do not proceed from God but proceed from God’s enemy the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have nothing against Catholics as men or women. I only take issue with the doctrines which that organization teaches. If the Catholic clergy want to be fair, why don’t they accept my proposition to publicly discuss these questions or doctrines and then let the people determine for themselves which is truth? The gag and bludgeon method can never make any of the people free, but, in the language of Jesus, “the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) You claim to speak for millions of Catholics; but I tell you that you do not speak for them. There are millions of good people in the Catholic organization who do not believe what you say. Why not let them all have an opportunity to hear both sides of the question discussed and then let them speak for themselves? You are not their guardians except by self-appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">THE POPE:</span><span class="font7"> Your papers say that I “slandered the Pope whose integrity is unquestioned by any reputable character”. You cannot cite a single word that I have ever uttered that is a slander of the man who occupies the office of pope of the Catholic organization. I have said nothing whatsoever against him as a man. What I did say is that no man, pope or otherwise, has any authority from God and Christ to declare any year a holy year. Neither Jehovah God nor Christ Jesus ever created the office of pope, and nowhere in the Bible does any such title appear. Neither God nor Christ Jesus ever appointed any man to the position of pope of the Catholic organization, and I call upon you to publish one word from the Holy Scriptures that even tends to prove to the contrary. The title of pope was never applied to any man until more than 300 years after the crucifixion of Christ. (See Volumes 6 and 22, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica; McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume 8, page 403.) If God and Christ wanted the pope on earth to tell the people what they shall believe or not believe, then why does not the Bible, which is the Word of God, give some evidence of that fact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have no personal antipathy to the man who at the present time holds the office of pope of the Catholic church. So far as I know, he may be a good man of the highest integrity, as that term is generally applied. I know nothing about him except that recently when I used a number of radio stations in Europe to broadcast the message of God’s kingdom I was informed that the pope had instructed all Catholics to refuse to listen to what I had to say. They did not obey him, however, because I had many letters of approval and commendation and best wishes from Catholics, which letters came from Holland, France, Austria, Spain, Italy and other places in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that a man occupies the office of pope of the Catholic organization is no evidence that he speaks with divine authority or that he has the approval of God and of Christ. In proof of this I refer you to the historical facts concerning men of the past who have occupied that office. The records of many of these men are too bad to publish here. Some of them were exceedingly immoral and bad men, which proves that they were not servants of God and of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You speak of the pope as “the holy father”, and your sensibilities are shocked when others do not publicly agree with you. You do this in the face of the plain statement by Jesus, to wit: “Call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” (Matthew 23:9) Surely I should be permitted to quote the words of the Lord Jesus without offending honest men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since neither Jehovah God nor Christ created the office of pope and no mention is made thereof in the Word of God, and since God’s Word does not authorize any man or the officer of any organization to declare this a ‘‘holy year”, then I ask by what authority any official in any organization can declare this a “holy year”. Is it your desire to mislead the people and to induce them to believe that a man has the authority and power to make any year holy? When this year is past and the people look back upon the great amount of suffering they have endured, and upon the great amount of wickedness and injustice practiced both inside and outside of the Catholic organization, they will well know that this is not a holy year, regardless of all proclamations concerning the same. There are millions of people on earth who do not believe that the pope has the authority or power to declare this or any other year a holy year, and other millions of people have the right to hear the evidence, that they too may determine for themselves what they want to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I suggest to you that no court or tribunal in America has ever yet decided (and I hope never will) that a man can be prevented from calling in question the doctrines or teachings of other men or organizations. If such a coercive rule as you advocate were adopted and enforced, then it would mean that the political party in power could successfully prevent the other parties out of power from calling attention to actions and policies falsely advocated and practiced upon the people. If you could have your way you would compel the people of America to acknowledge without question the doctrines of the Catholic organization, which doctrines the masses of the people do not believe to be true. Whenever the courts exercise the power to prohibit the criticism of doctrines or teachings of any organization, then the liberties of the American people are gone and the purpose for which the nation was organized has ceased to exist. You, the editors of newspapers, who claim that you are publishing your papers in the interest of the people, by calling upon the radio commission to bar any man from the air because he calls in question the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">doctrines</span><span class="font7"> of your organization, are thereby demanding that the courts or tribunals take away the liberties of the people and keep the people in ignorance of what God’s Word plainly teaches. Whom do you then represent in thus trying to blind the people to the truth of Jehovah God’s Word? (2 Corinthians 4:4) Surely you do not represent Jehovah God; and that being true, you must be the servants of the god of this world whether you know it or not.—Romans 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">OTHER FALSEHOODS:</span><span class="font7"> Almost everything you have published about my radio speeches is false. You charge me with indulging in “vituperation”, which is entirely foreign to the facts. Your statement concerning the radio and its use in Canada is also untrue. There some clergymen, who did not want to hear the truth, protested to the Commission and the Commission stopped the broadcast. You did not publish the further fact, however, that immediately thereafter 406,000 citizens of Canada filed with the Canadian House of Commons a petition asking that my lectures be continued on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The message which I and my brethren are proclaiming is not the message of any man, but it is Jehovah God’s message concerning His kingdom. You may be able to prevent radio stations from broadcasting the truth and the Lord may not interfere with you for a time, but His arm is not shortened and you will not at all retard the proclamation of His Word. Your opposition has only increased the desire of the people to hear more about God’s kingdom, and Jehovah has provided the ways and means. Already hundreds of transcription machines have been manufactured and placed in the hands of the people, with numerous records of speech, which are daily being delivered to the people and informing them concerning God’s kingdom. Every day the people are learning more and more that opposition such as you offer does not proceed from Jehovah, but that it proceeds from the god of this world, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You say that these lectures are attacks on Catholics and insulting to Catholics. The people know that such statement by you is untrue. Every statement yet made in any of my lectures is fully supported by the Word of God, which is the truth. (John 17:17) No honest person could be insulted by God’s Word of truth. There are many honest persons in the ranks of the Catholic organization who have been held there because they had no opportunity to hear and to learn the truth. But they are learning it now. For keeping the people in ignorance in this manner the pastors and clergymen and priests and their allies are held liable, and God gives His Word that He will punish them for their wrong-doing.-See Ezekiel 34:1-20; Jeremiah 25:33-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You charge that my words are seditious; and that is wholly false. Never have I uttered a seditious word against the Government. It was the clergymen and priests and their allies that falsely charged Jesus with the crime of sedition; and hiding behind the judgment of a false and wicked court, they caused His precious blood to be wrongfully shed. You may get my lifeblood and thereby hope to stop the proclamation of the truth; but be assured that the message of God’s kingdom will continue to be proclaimed just the same. I am but one of those of Jehovah’s witnesses who as a “voice in the wilderness” is crying out to the people that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and that this kingdom under Christ is the only hope of mankind. Your </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gag</span><span class="font7"> and bludgeon methods will not in any manner retard the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom, which He is now sending to the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">JUDGMENT:</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah God has written His judgment against Satan and every part of his organization, both visible and invisible, and at the battle of the great day of God Almighty, led by Jesus Christ, that judgment will be executed and every part of the wicked organization shall go down to destruction. Then the Catholic organization as such will be no more; and only those honest Catholics who turn their hearts away from “man worship”, and who turn them wholly to the worship and service of Jehovah God and Christ, will survive. For this reason Jehovah now says to His people through His prophet: “Before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you . . . seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s judgment is written against the pastors and the shepherds and clergymen who have taught and misled the people and who together with the principal of their flocks have coerced radio stations and others to refrain from proclaiming the truth of God’s kingdom. His judgment written shows that such opposers will find no way of escape at the execution of His judgment at Armageddon. Note Jeremiah 25: 34-36: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You complain because I speak the truth concerning “purgatory”. For many years the Catholic organization has taught the people that their dead friends are conscious in a place called “purgatory” and that Catholic priests, who are merely imperfect men, can pray for the dead and benefit them and thereby shorten the duration of their punishment and in time secure their release from “purgatory”. You will not attempt to deny this as one of the doctrines preached by your organization, and this you have done and continue to do in the face of the scriptures which read that ‘all the dead are in the grave’ (John 5: 28); and, “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.” (Psalm 115:17) “The dead </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">know not any thing&quot;;</span><span class="font7"> “there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10) You would have the people believe you rather than to believe God’s Word of truth. By your teaching of this false doctrine of “purgatory” you have induced many a poor person to give up his or her money to have prayers said for their dead ones who are supposed to be in “purgatory”. That is obtaining money by taking advantage of the ignorance of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">COMPARISON:</span><span class="font7"> In this letter I would have made no reference to personal deeds committed by men or organizations except for the fact that you have made it necessary. You could have opposed my speech without attacking me personally. In keeping with your fixed policy you have preferred the latter; therefore the comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best part of my life on earth and all my material substance has been spent in an honest endeavor to teach the people the plain Word of God’s truth and to turn the minds of men away from creature worship and turn them to the faithful worship and service of Jehovah God that they might gain eternal life in endless happiness. In that time you have been able to find but one so-called ‘black spof on my record, namely, the fact that I was imprisoned during the World War, and which imprisonment was procured by a cruel conspiracy formed and carried into effect by your organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic hierarchy has spent more than 1500 years in hiding the truth of God’s Word from the people and in turning the minds of men to the service and worship of creatures instead of the worship and service of Jehovah God. The work of that hierarchy has been and is done by selfish men concerning which the Scriptures say: “Men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain [in numbers of followers and material wealth] is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.” (1 Timothy 6: 5) Every page of the history of the Catholic hierarchy is marked with black crime. It has employed the cruel Inquisition to compel the people to follow its doctrines and practices. It has in all those fifteen centuries resorted to coercion to silence everyone who has dared to call in question its doctrines. If your organization held and taught the truth you would welcome criticism and would gladly come forward and discuss the matter in the presence of the people, that they might exercise their own free will and determine for themselves what they wished to believe. Since you have no truth, and since your organization was ‘born in sin and shapen in iniquity’, you resort to cruel and oppressive methods to hide your sins and to deceive the people. Why don’t you hear and teach the truth and encourage others to do likewise? In the language of Jesus the answer is, Because “ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do”.—John 8: 43,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although you know that up to this time there is no law in America to prevent the free expression of opinion concerning the doctrines or teachings of others, yet you continue to browbeat, threaten to boycott and otherwise to coerce radio stations to prevent the broadcasting of the truth. You claim that you do this in the interest of common decency and for the good of the people; which claim is hypocritical in the extreme. You cry “intolerance” and “bigotry”, when in fact your organization is the most intolerant and bigoted one in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because I say to the public that no man, whether he be a pope or otherwise, can make a year holy, for the reason that only God can make things holy, you begin an intolerant campaign against me and my brethren, which campaign you carry on maliciously and without regard for the rights of the people. Simultaneously the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses starts in the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. Did this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">happen?</span><span class="font7"> or is it the carrying out of an order from the headquarters of your hierarchy? You were the first ones in America to report the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Bavaria ; and this for the very reason that it was incited and carried out by members of your intolerant organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was at the instance of your organization that in June last twenty-nine innocent and faithful women citizens of New<sup>7</sup> Jersey were arrested in Plainfield and thrown into prison, crowded into small and filthy cells, and required to Stand up all night, and this because as Jehovah’s witnesses they were calling at the homes of the people in this time of distress, and seeking to comfort them by directing them to the study of God’s Word of truth. The arrest and imprisonment of those good and faithful women was not only intolerant, but was barbaric cruelty, wholly uncalled for in a civilized land. There was a time when the Protestant church organizations resented your oppressive methods; but in this evil day they have ceased to protest, and this makes you ever more bold in your persecution of the true followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">APPROACHING STORM:</span><span class="font7"> From every quarter of the earth I see gathering together the hordes of Satan under the leadership of Gog, of which the Catholic hierarchy is the greatest visible part, and all of these marching on with the malicious purpose and intent to accomplish the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. I know that already your hierarchy is seeking some apparent legal excuse to kill all of Jehovah’s witnesses. I would be appalled and faint with sickness because of what I see is shortly coming upon the earth were it not for the fact that Jehovah has given His Word that He will smite the wicked oppressive organization and deliver His faithful people. Jehovah’s witnesses must and will finish the work God has assigned to them. That witness work may be about done for the present; and when completed, then there shall come upon the world, as the Lord Jesus declares, “great tribulation, such as was not [known] since the beginning of the world.”—■ Matthew 24:14-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy of the Catholic hierarchy have assumed to be shepherds of the people and call themselves such, but they are not true shepherds; hence Jehovah now says to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">them: “Behold, I am </span><span class="font7">against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.” (Ezekiel 34:10) Jehovah then says that this shall be the plague wherewith He will smite those that have fought against His organization: “Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.” (Zechariah 14:12) Jehovah God will exercise His power in the interest of the poor and oppressed people: “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.” —Psalm 72:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, gentlemen, I have said nothing here in malice, but have written these lines wholly in the interest of truth and righteousness. I have called your attention to the Scriptures as well as to the facts, and every one who honestly serves God wants to be judged according to the Scriptures and the facts. “For we must all appear before the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">judgment seat of Christ; that </span><span class="font7">every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10) You have received notice, and when standing before that judgment seat of Christ, who is the great Judge, you can never be heard to say that you </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ignorantly</span><span class="font7"> opposed the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom which is now being carried to the people by Jehovah’s witnesses. I think you have heretofore received a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font7"> booklet; but, that there may be no mistake, I am sending each of you a copy, under separate cover, with my compliments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You and other clergymen whom you represent have declined my kind invitation to come forth in the open and discuss the truth, that the people might hear and judge. You have thus prevented them from hearing the truth. You prefer to resort to coercion, gag and bludgeon methods to thus keep them in ignorance. You have received fair notice. Now you must take the responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">EXT to mismanagement nothing has caused as many cracks in the American banking structure as the high-pressure expansion of the promoter spirit. Its steam is generated from greed and ambition. Synthetic enthusiasm and unreasoning optimism act as a super-charger. Among the thousands of promoters who posed as bankers, until their banks blew up, are many who plead that in their promotions they were merely demonstrating their faith in their country. Today, as in the time of Dr. Samuel Johnson, patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. In its name one is asked to be lenient with stupidity, to forgive cupidity, and to wink an eye at dishonesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is small comfort to any one of the millions of depositors who suffered because of the 10,400 bank failures of the past thirteen years to be told by an ex-banker that he dissipated the depositor’s savings by loans and investments made on false and inflated valuations of real estate or stock market securities because he didn’t want to sell America—or the home town—short. Another of Dr. Johnson’s observations, it will be recalled, was that hell is paved with good intentions. So are depressions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">C. Boyd, of England, says: “In the days • of armored knights and feudal lords, it was the custom to celebrate the holding of a joust, the knighting of a youth, or similar occurrences, with banqueting and revelry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“An amusement fashionable at such functions was to place upon the table before the dining guests a pie, which, after it was cooked, had been filled with living blackbirds. The cutting of the crust would release the frightened birds, which were instantly pursued about the hall by falcons which attendants had secretly held in readiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The pandemonium of terrified fluttering caused an excitement which was much appreciated by the company; the ladies especially being thrilled and stimulated by the 'pleasant surprise’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This practice is said to be the origin of the well-known nursery rhyme:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye. Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie. When the pie was opened the birds began to sing. Wasn’t that a dainty dish to set before the king?’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">AYS John H. Frazier, of Oklahoma: “Truth is always in perfect agreement with reality. As a straight line is everywhere the same, even so there is no variation in truth, wherever found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Knowledge is rapidly increasing. Old and new facts are coming to light. Biblical truth is sweeping the earth, and before its advance ignorance, superstition, and false doctrines must vanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Imagine a man who is able to own a modern automobile but rides in an ox-drawn vehicle. He would be considered an old fogy. Yet he is no further behind than the man who clings to the false creeds and dogmas handed down to us from the Dark Ages. We still have these creeds with us in our modern churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“On hearing the truth many ask themselves, ‘Is that in harmony with what I have been taught ?’ instead of carefully searching the Scriptures to prove the correctness of what they hear. Anyone having been mistaught has capacity for the truth only to the extent that he is willing to unlearn the error he has taken into his system. Our vessel must be emptied of the slush of human tradition before it can receive the pure water of truth.”</span></p>

No such sovietizing of business, with such acquiescence by industry in such a revolutionary experiment, would have been conceivable except in the midst of depression and public despair.

<p><span class="font18">G</span><span class="font7">OLDEN AGE: Fabled age of primitive simplicity and happiness. In the mythologies of most peoples and religions there exists a tradition of a better time, when the earth was the common property of man, and produced spontaneously all things necessary for an enjoyable existence. The land flowed with milk and honey, beasts of prey lived peaceably with other animals, and man had not yet by selfishness, pride and other vices and passions fallen from a state of innocence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the foundation of this legend lies the deep-rooted opinion that the world has degenerated with the progress of civilization and that mankind, while leading a simple, patriarchal life, were happier than at present. The Greeks and Homans placed this golden age under the rule of Saturn; and many of their poets, for example, Hesiod, in his </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Works and Days;</span><span class="font7"> Aratus, Ovid, and, above all, Virgil, in the first books of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Georgies,</span><span class="font7"> have turned this poetic material to admirable account and defined the gradual decadence of the world as the silver, the brass, and the iron ages, holding out the hope that the age of gold will one day return.</span></p>

Penn Yan, New York, has had a similarly wonderful experience. $30,000 in paid bills have been sent back to customers. A new customer pays but 50c for his first 13 kilowatt hours, and after that but 3c per kilowatt hour. Compare that with your own electric bill and you will see why the people of Penn Yan are proud of their municipal plant.</span></p>

The college career is lengthened, but the graduates, when they come out, are trained men and practically sure of placement in the business world, as their connections have already been made.

In 1932 only 40 schools remained closed; last year the number was around 2,500; by April of this year, it is estimated by Dr. John K. Norton, of Columbia University, chairman of the joint commission on the emergency in education, some 20,000 schools will be forced to close and 1,020,000 children will be without public instruction. One out of every four teachers receives less than $750 a year, and more than 84,000 rural teachers receive less than $450. There are 55,000 fewer teachers than two years ago, but the ones that are still employed are instructing 1,400,000 more students. Meanwhile the Roman Catholic church is trying to get money out of the public treasury to instruct children in its own peculiar conglomeration of superstitions.</span></p>

At that rate the initial cost of the leather in a pair of shoes would be about IViC. But, even by machinery, it costs several cents to make a pair of shoes; so the conclusion should not be jumped at that the profits are anything like $4.98% in a $5 pair of brogans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">JANUARY, 1925, C. Bascom Slemp, of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font7">Virginia, who was at that time secretary to President Coolidge, resigned his position. Being secretary to the president of the United States is quite a job, and many people wondered why Bascom resigned. But they don’t wonder any more; they know now. Within a few months thereafter Bascom put through a deal by which the government sold eighteen ships of its shipping board at $7.50 per ton, instead of $8.50 per ton, which the government had asked, and which was even then but a fraction of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">their cost to the </span><span class="font7">taxpayers. The ships went to the Export Steamship Corporation, and on July 1 of that year that corporation paid Mr. Slemp $3,000 for his services, and within twenty days paid him another $12,000. Thereafter, the government also did the handsome thing by the Export Steamship Corporation; they paid them $300,000 for carrying four pounds of mail; you heard about that. That seemed a little bit high, that is, $75,000 per pound, so they cut it down to $66,000 per pound. Those are some of the reasons why Bascom resigned. They console us all. He should have resigned; the more he resigns the better. And if he and all his kind were shipped by parcel post to earth’s remotest realm it would be worth $75,000 a pound to get them off by themselves somewhere; and sad as we should be bereaved thereby, there is no doubt that we would bear up bravely, and be resigned. Now, if the Devil and the clergy would all resign!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">California Old Age Pensions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By M. A. Wallace {California')</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font7">N 1929 the California legislature passed what is known as an “old age pension bill”, but called by the legislature, “State aid to the needy aged.” The law became operative January 1, 1930. An applicant for pension must be 70 years old or more and must have been a citizen of the United States at least fifteen years, must have resided in California at least fifteen years, and must have no children or anyone else to take care of him. The maximum amount of pension is thirty dollars per month. If the applicant has any home or property of his own he must give the county a mortgage or deed of trust on the same, before he can get any pension at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the applicant has no home he would not get money enough to rent a home, after he buys something to eat. So there you are. The legislators who passed this bill were surely very </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">un-</span><span class="font7">philanthropic persons, and if they live to be old enough to need a pension it is to be hoped they will get the same kind of dole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some years ago the California legislature passed a pretty good pension bill, but the governor of the state vetoed the bill and it was lost. It seems that all over the state there are little offices kept up to administer to the wants of the “aged needy”, which will certainly consume much of the funds that should go to the old people in regular monthly checks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The progressive limitation of the NRA program, eliminating this or that section or excluding this or that class, proves conclusively that the policy is not universally applicable or practicable. As a matter of fact it is universally impracticable, and if persisted in will become universally detrimental. ... It would seem to me, Mr. Davis, in view of the fact that the NRA is a menace to political rights and constitutional liberties, a danger to American ideals and institutions, a handicap to industrial recovery and a detriment to public welfare, that the publishers of a free press ought to tolerate it less and expose and oppose it more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Eliminate the starchy foods, such as potatoes, pies, cakes and pastries, from your diet as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eat all of the green foods that you can, and when green foods are out of season you should eat several apples every day; and if this is not convenient, such foods as dried figs, prunes and dates. Make it a habit to eat lettuce, spinach, cabbage, parsnips, turnips, etc., frequently. Salad dressings and highly seasoned foods should be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If convenient, we recommend the use of whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Avoid all kinds of fried foods. If you relish potatoes and feel that you cannot eliminate them entirely from your diet, we recommend baked potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, it is not necessary for us to give you these diet suggestions, but we feel it our duty to do everything within our power to help you to build up your system so that you can ward off disease, and we know from observation and wide study that the diet is responsible for many ills. Eat moderately and try to leave the table just a little bit hungry. Be sure to keep the bowels open with at least one good movement a day.</span></p>

Robin’s-plantain </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Erigeron pulchellus), </span><span class="font7">or the blue spring daisy, blossoms in May and June. Rub the crushed green leaves as hard as you wish into the poison. It will be slightly green. Let it dry. Do not wash off. Repeat several times during day if itching bothers. It usually kills the poison in one day. In a very bad case steep the green leaves and drink same during the day and bathe poison with it. The dried herb may be bought at drug stores. One teaspoon dried leaves to one cup boiling water. Steep twenty minutes. When cool bathe poison and let dry. Drink same if poisoned inside. In about an hour one has relief, usually all day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Another Recipe for Whole-Wheat Bread</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">rs. John Walters, of Saskatchewan, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The day before you intend to bake, save some of the water from your boiled potatoes at noon; and when warm add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a half cake of yeast. Set this mixture in a warm place to ferment until the following morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Warm about a gallon of whole-wheat flour, and add enough warm water with the yeast to make a sponge slightly stiffer than for white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let this rest, then salt to taste, and knead down with more flour to a good stiff dough that will not stick to your hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let this rise again, and then mould into loaves. &quot;When these have risen, bake in moderate oven one and one-half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This amount will make about nine loaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“If the yeast fermented well the previous day, both sponge and dough will rise very quickly. Whole-wheat bread does not require as much yeast as does white bread, and should not stand any longer than necessary, as it sours more quickly than does white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Do not allow the sponge or the dough to get too warm, or the bread will be dark and heavy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When buying whole-wheat flour, see that you get a good brand of number one whole wheat; and it will not be necessary to mix any white flour with it. I also use this flour for cakes and pastries, adding about one-third white flour for pastries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bread for Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font7">C. Ross, of South Carolina, says: “There was an article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> some time ago about prunes, raisins and senna leaves as an eliminator. After using wheat for bread and cereal, would like to state it is much better. Very good grinders may be procured at almost any hardware store for 50c. Ask for iron coffee grinder. They are adjustable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The best way to make whole-wheat cereal is to crack wheat coarser than for bread and let soak overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A fine, wholesome bread can be made without an oven. Take wheat ground fine, a little salt, baking powder, and mix with milk. (Be sure baking powder does not contain aluminum phosphate or salts of aluminum.) Bake in heavy frying pan greased lightly. Cook slowly and keep covered. Time cooking to turn once. Of course, better results can be obtained in an oven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This whole-wheat bread and cereal is the best eliminator we have ever found. To obtain results one has to be regular, eating it every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There is another good point: it surely cuts the cost of living, and does away with a craving hunger.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is said that this tea produces such marvelous results, when used in this way, that at time of parturition the event is frequently all over in ten or fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On an ounce of dried raspberry leaves pour a pint of boiling vater. Cover closely, and let it soak until cold. Strain; sweeten. Dose: Half a pint, hot, at bedtime, and 2^ hours after morning and noon meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This remedy is said to be very beneficial in uterine and urinary troubles of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulgarian Milk Versus German Chemicals</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font7">C. Davies, of Wales, says: “According to</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• report, longevity seems to be a marked characteristic of the Bulgarians. A few years ago, out of a total population of 7,000,000, there were over 3,700 people a hundred years old. This is an amazing number, in comparison with Germany, which at the same time had 61,000,000 inhabitants, but only 71 of whom were centenarians. The conclusion drawn by physicians who have investigated this long span of years apparently so common among Bulgarian peasants attributes this longevity to the fact that one of their staple articles of food is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yogurt,</span><span class="font7"> a kind of fermented milk which possesses extraordinary bactericidal properties. It would doubtless be a good idea for you Germans to go to Bulgaria for a while. Wonder if they would advise you to put less poison down your throat, as it kills this life-giving germ and shortens your life in the bargain. There are many who would like to try </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yogurt,</span><span class="font7"> but don’t know how it is made.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Raw Foods Did for Me</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font7">E. Brokaw, of California, says: “In a • back issue was a communication in which Professor Ehret’s teaching on diet was mentioned. You remarked that ‘when Ehret or anybody else mixes diet and religion he is mixing things that do not mix’. In reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any one’s </span><span class="font7">statements we should rely on our own judgment. Professor Ehret did much good in pointing out the dangers many diet enthusiasts made in their haste. Since reading his book I came in contact with Mr. and Mrs. Richter, of Los Angeles. They conduct two raw food cafeterias there, which are well patronized. From Dr. Richter I learned what to eat to cure my dropsy, all signs of which have disappeared since last spring, although I am past the age at which men are supposed to recover from it—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> final manifestation of kidney troubles. The strictly raw food diet did it, and everyone tells me I am looking very much better ; and I am continually improving. It will not hurt your readers to get in touch with the Richters. They may not possess the ‘last word’ on diet, but certainly are ahead of most dietists.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Reason He Had a Stiff Neck</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font7">MAN in Spokane, Washington, while intoxicated, was in an automobile accident. A week later, complaining of a stiff neck, he submitted to a medical examination, and to his complete surprise, and that of others, the surgeon drew from a small wound in the back of his neck a piece of glass an inch wide at the base and six inches long which had penetrated all the way to his chin without severing an artery. The removal of the glass was unaccompanied by pain. Sounds like a fairy story, doesn’t it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">• been a heavy meat-eater all my life (I am now fifty-one), about five years ago I began to develop rheumatism and those distressing piles which make life most miserable.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“About January 15 of last year I decided to leave off practically all flesh food, and especially all pork. Prior to the above date, and for two or three years, those ailments were pretty bad and kept getting worse, and it began to appear to me that I would soon be ready for the junk pile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Thanks to leaving off the meat in my diet, in six months I was considerably better, and now at the end of the year both my troubles are gone. I lay it all to abstaining from meat, especially pork.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Our Lord ate roast Iamb and broiled fish, and that settles the vegetarian question, but He did not eat roast pork. Man was created fructivorous; and we think that in the end he will return to that diet, and be glad.—L'd.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">S</span><span class="font7">AYS P. J. de Jager, of Cape Town, South</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Africa: “I am writing from a small village not far from the borders of the Kalahari desert (Olifantshoed). Yesterday -we were working in another small village with Judge Rutherford’s books when I met a gentleman living there who has spent considerable time in close association with the natives of central Africa. In our discussion the question of the Flood was mentioned, when he remarked that he has found evidence of the Flood in the traditions of those natives, and he related to me the following, which I thought might be of interest to you:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The hippopotamus, when a fire is made close to its haunts, consistently comes forth and tramples on it till it is extinguished. He has tested it himself. So he asked one of his native servants, who frequently related to him tales about animals as they ran in their tradition, why the hippo did that, and he received the following reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ ‘When the world was young it was destroyed by water. The hippopotamus did not mind that; for he loved water. Now the world will be destroyed by fire in future. The hippopotamus has heard that, and he makes sure that the fire will not start in his neighborhood anyway? ”</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19340214_files/g_E_19340214-9.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">arold W. Kline, of Pennsylvania, says: “Was talking to Otto G. Haussman, doubt</span><span class="font7">less the leading optometrist in Philadelphia, at his office, 726 Chestnut street, Philadelphia, last evening, and he was showing me some spectacles, first the intricacies of ordinary spectacles, then bifocals, then trifocals and quadrifocals. The trifocals and quadrifocals are being patented, and are not on the market yet. The purpose, of course, of the trifocals and quadrifocals is the same as of the bifocals: to secure varying vision distances, due to the lack of functioning of the eye-focusing muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“How happy the time when the eye, as well as all other parts of the body, will function without ‘crutches’, and every particle of the human body will reflect praise and glory to its Maker. I found Mr. Haussman a typical efficient German, who has attained much success by much hard work and honest dealing. He does not believe in dilating the eye by use of drugs. And, of course, the old school of doctors and oculists are opposed to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Dream of a Much-needed Invention</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">C</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">harles Faber, of Minnesota, says: “I had a dream the other night that I want to tell you about. I didn’t feel like telling it to anyone except my wife until I read of the uses of the electric eye, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> No. 370. I dreamed that I had an auto that didn’t need to be steered unless one wanted to turn or pass another car, and then it was only to touch a button. If it got too close to another car it would stop of itself. Other cars on the road were the same, and if two cars met, as before a head-on collision, both cars would stop of themselves; and the same took place when two cars met at right angles at a crossroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“If people had cars like that there would be no accidents; and I wonder if we won’t have just that kind of cars in the very near future. The strange part of the dream is that I never owned a car and always say that I don’t want one even if I could afford to have one, as they are a dangerous thing in the hands of most people. Don’t you think that the electric eye could be used on a car in the way I saw it in my dream?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wind Nearly Dried Niagara Falls</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font7">N NOVEMBER, 1933, a three-day wind from the east drove the waters of Lake Erie back upon themselves, and toward the close of that time the Niagara falls were nearly dry. The great flood at Galveston, September 8,1900, was due to a similar wind from the east blowing the waters of the Gulf of Mexico over the city. The flood, upward of twelve feet deep, caused the loss of 6,000 lives. The city is now protected against a recurrence by a sea wall twelve miles long and 17 feet high. Moses’ crossing the Red sea was made possible by a strong wind from the east which separated the waters. We say that “water seeks its level”, but such is not true; it seeks its curve, where each part of the surface will be equidistant from the center of the earth—unless interfered with by the moon or by high winds.</span></p>

On this track will be fifty huge cars, each weighing 150 tons, and each carrying a rotor 22 feet in diameter and 90 feet high, spinning at the rate of one turn per second. The cars will be coupled to each other by cables and will circulate at twenty miles an hour. Once the system is started by the application of power from the outside, the rotors will do the rest, if the wind is as great as six miles per hour. One $140,000 unit of this huge plant has been built, and engineers declare the plan entirely practical. It seems as if such a plant would in any but the calmest weather supply a good share of all the electric current needed in New Jersey. The unit already constructed is at Burlington, in that state. The total cost of the entire projected plant is set at about $2,000,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">T THE time of the Flood the ring of atmospheric vapor which encompassed the earth fell at the poles in the form of snow. Under the great pressure to which these mountainous snows were subjected they turned into ice and have made of the polar regions vast refrigerators. In Siberia, in places where the earth is frozen to a depth of 400 feet, thawing is under way, and among numerous forms of animal life brought to light have been several mammoths, great creatures taller than an elephant, with hair fourteen inches long. Several of these have become uncovered in recent years. In one instance, in 1926, a mother was found with its flesh in perfect condition; next to it was a baby mammoth, with its body pressed against that of its mother in an attitude of terror. Both were suffocated when the snows overwhelmed them. The meat was edible and of good flavor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">I crept into the minds of millions, seeking wealth , and power;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even nations adopted my use and fell into line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Great companies and corporations were formed for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now my agents cover the earth in about everything; Even ruthless methods are applied for my gain;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My rate of toll is being increased beyond power to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today my toll runs into billions and billions a year, Yet I will multiply the debt of man and nations, That my toll will greatly increase from year to year. ’ The rich and poor alike are mine: wealth is my aim;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Their master now am I. I have the power and law; ' The Master that gave man life, only, can give him liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He may open the eyes of man and rebel against me, But until then men and nations must pay my price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men working, fighting, scheming for wealth and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">power, </span><span class="font6">Yet they cannot escape me, I am Interest.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font6"> AM Interest, originally known as Usury,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Master forbade my practice; warning all men, Even Christ turned me down and cast me out;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The canonical laws, in Middle Ages, forbade my use. Martin Luther claimed my users should be hanged. My users could not be buried on consecrated ground. Estates my users forfeited; their children were disinherited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fourteenth century brought me classed with murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries I fought for recognition, but to no avail; For I was looked upon as most base and cruel by men. Wherever I appeared I was despised and condemned; Yet I struggled on unceasingly, fighting for my use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I used every crooked mind and crooked scheme;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I whispered in the ear of man, that wealth was power;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I conceived the plan of Greed, the road to wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men listened; my hearers multiplied in numbers. They made laws for my use. They defied their Master.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Proclaiming on the Housetops</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">“And what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font7">HESE words of command, like all the rest of the tenth chapter of the gospel of Matthew, are addressed to the disciples of Christ, and to them alone; as it is written: “And when he had called unto him his </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">twelve disciples,</span><span class="font7"> he . . . commanded </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">them,</span><span class="font7"> saying, . . . And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.”—Matthew 10:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The words of Jesus uttered on that occasion were prophetic, and it is evident that His apostles fulfilled that prophecy in a miniature or small-scale way only. The prophecy has its final fulfilment upon the remnant of Christ’s true disciples on earth at the present time, when preparations are going forward for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which will wreck Satan’s organization and vindicate Jehovah’s name. During the past ten years there has gone forward a vigorous campaign of testimony to the name of Jehovah, particularly since 1931. That year it was made manifest to the remnant of God’s faithful people on earth that He has put upon them a new name which His own mouth has named and has caused to be foretold in His written Word, namely, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” (Isaiah 62: 2; 65:15; Revelation 2:17; Isaiah 43:10-12; 44:8) Since then this witness work has taken on a wider scope. As the witness work has greatly increased Satan and his representatives have been more persistent in their opposition, and the persecution of the faithful witnesses has increased with intensity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in the year 1918, during the worst throes of the World War, that the bitter opposition against the message of God’s kingdom and the ones proclaiming it began to be especially marked. Since that time the arrest and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses has continued with marked hatred and malice expressed by the ruling powers of the various nations. This exactly fulfils the words of Jesus spoken on the above-mentioned occasion to His disciples, to wit: “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.”—Matthew 10: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Should Jehovah’s witnesses expect anything from the representatives of Satan but hatred, malice and persecution? Jesus answered that question and said (verses 24, 25): “The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?” As Jesus suffered contradiction and persecution at the hands of Satan’s agents, so He makes it clear that all of His faithful disciples must be subject to the same thing, for the reason that it is enough for the disciple that he do as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. Jesus maintained His integrity under such suffering, and the present-day remnant of His faithful followers must do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chief among the visible representatives or agents of Satan is the Roman hierarchy (ecclesiastical rulers), and many are the dupes under the control of that hierarchy. Let it be understood that there are many good and honest Catholics, but the ones who organized and still continue to operate the Roman hierarchy are cruel in the extreme. For centuries that institution has defamed and brought reproach upon the name of Jehovah by its numerous false doctrines and wicked practices, which have resulted in turning millions away from the worship of the Creator and to the service of creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic hierarchy, operating for more than 1,500 years, is a political organization, although claiming to be God’s servant. All political organizations are selfish, but the Roman hierarchy is more than that. It is conscienceless, cruel and wicked beyond the description of human words. It resorts to all manner of sharp practices and crooked political methods to accomplish its purpose. It seeks to control every nation of earth where it operates. It is a commercial organization using the name of Christian as a camouflage. To be commercial is bad enough, but the Roman hierarchy organization cruelly and wickedly traffics in human flesh and blood. It bleeds millions of its people, deprives them of their sacred rights, by fraud and false pretenses obtains their money and property, and with its ill-got gains it strengthens and operates its powerful organization to the detriment of mankind. It is “religious” in name and in fact, because it practices formalism and ceremonies without regard to Scriptural support for the same. It misapplies the Scriptures and willfully hides the truth in order to shield its unholy practices. That would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bad enough, </span><span class="font7">but its religion is a defamation of Jehovah’s holy name and the organization is used to exalt the name of creatures, which practice the Lord God denounces as an abomination. (Luke 16:15) It bears the earmarks of its father, and by the Word of God it is plainly identified as the offspring and servant of the Devil. The following appropriate words are quoted from the writing of a well-known university instructor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For nearly eighteen years I have closely studied and observed the papal system here at the National Capital. During the last thirteen years I have taught the history of canon law to graduate classes in a university. That experience has deepened the conviction that the Church of Rome is essentially an international empire masquerading under the pretense of religion. It overlies every nation of the earth and enforces its law and authority within their borders and upon their citizens. It never answers its critics, but seeks their destruction by the boycott, by sinister pressure and intrigue, and by vicious abuse of deceived governmental power. Its activities are all directed by authority of the triple-crowned autocrat of the Vatican, whom nobody elects and who reigns under claim of divine right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Protestantism, which once tried to expose the Roman hierarchy, has lost its protest and has been lulled to sleep by the false and fraudulent cry: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“We</span><span class="font7"> must have peace at any price, and there must be unity between the mother church and other Christians.” Satan has thus overreached them and caused the Protestants to become a reproach to the name of Jehovah and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s primary lie was: ‘There is no death.’ (Genesis 3:4, 5) This is a contradiction of God’s word and a defamation of His name. For centuries Satan’s representatives on earth, parading under the name of God and of Christ, have taught the people that when a man is understood to die, he does not in fact die, but that he has an immortal soul separate and distinct from the man, which soul goes to purgatory, hell torment, and probably a few to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore, Satan’s representatives teach that the prayers of men can aid those who are suffering in purgatory and have their sufferings lessened. This has been a fruitful source of revenue for the hierarchy, and we know that could not have been by the will of God. These false doctrines are defamations of God’s name and have turned millions away from the true God. When Jehovah’s witnesses speak the truth, and cite the Word of God showing that they are telling the truth regarding these false doctrines taught by men, the truth greatly enrages the visible representatives of Satan, and these Satanic agents wickedly and cruelly oppose the witness work, and this they do secretly and openly, and they seek by all manner of means to bring about the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and to destroy their testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rome is the earthly seat of that wicked religious organization which poses before the world as the representative of God but which said organization is in fact a political mercantile institution operated selfishly and to accomplish selfish purposes and to dishonor the true God. In Italy Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted and compelled to flee and to carry on their witness work in another part of “Christendom”. The Roman influence dominates the religious element of Germany. In the state of Bavaria, a stronghold of Romanism, the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses began, and within a few hours that information was published by Roman Catholic papers in America, showing that they were in touch with the headquarters in Rome. Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire to fight Roman Catholics </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">as such,</span><span class="font7"> because that is not their work. Jehovah’s witnesses are commissioned to bear testimony to the truth of Jehovah’s Word and they call attention to the errors taught by the Catholic hierarchy and others which defame the name of Jehovah God, and this they do in order that the people may see the truth. The Roman hierarchy refuses to hear the truth, for the reason that those who operate that system are the representatives of their father the Devil, even as Jesus stated, in John 8:40-44. Not being able to defend their false doctrines before intelligent people, and fearing that they may lose the support of many good and honest people who have been held in their institution, and in order to blind the people to the truth and hide their own wickedness, the members of this Roman hierarchy bring further reproach upon Jehovah’s name by resorting to all manner of lies and vicious persecution of those who are sincerely and honestly trying to tell the truth to mankind as it is written in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Communists!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic servants of Satan have represented to the political rulers that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in political schemes for the purpose of overthrowing present earthly governments. Such charge is a vicious and wicked lie. These representatives of Satan charge that Jehovah’s witnesses are communists and socialists; which charge is absolutely false. Jehovah’s witnesses are working under the commandment of the Lord Jehovah, and as the representative of the organization of His people on earth the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society sends forth the directions for such work. This Society has been in existence for more than fifty years and never at any time has engaged in any political matters whatsoever. On the contrary, those who love God and His kingdom are diligent to obey His commandments, one of which is: ‘Keep yourselves unspotted from the world.’ (James 1:27) “The world” means the political, commercial and religious organizations that jointly operate as the visible rulers of this world and carry on under the supervision of the invisible overlord Satan. The true Christian cannot participate in politics in any form. He must be a witness to Jehovah and therefore hold himself aloof from political matters. Nothing in the activities of the Society can be cited to indicate that it has any connection whatsoever with any political organization. It stands entirely for God’s kingdom under Christ, which kingdom is not of this world.—John 18: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peddlers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is Satan who has made merchandise of the human race and organized a great political commercial system that has cruelly oppressed the common people and defamed God’s holy name. (Ezekiel 28:13-19) In the various states, cities, towns and other municipalities laws have been enacted to govern the peddling of goods, wares and merchandise. It is well known that it was never the intention or purpose of the lawmakers in framing such laws to interfere in any wise with the preaching of the gospel of God’s kingdom. It is only in recent years, and particularly since the close of the World War, that the enemy has seized upon these laws long ago on the statute books and uses them as an instrument for the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. Because Jehovah’s witnesses call upon the people with books containing the Kingdom message and accept from the people who take these books a contribution of less than it costs to make and deliver the books, the visible religious representatives of Satan cause these faithful preachers of the gospel to be arrested on the charge of ‘peddling without a license’. In every instance such an arrest has been made at the complaint or influence of a clergyman, and particularly those of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Upon these false and wrongful charges many of Jehovah’s witnesses have recently suffered abuse, rough treatment and imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Roman communities, such as Plainfield, New Jersey, Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested and imprisoned for merely distributing a notice of a Bible lecture, which notice invited the people to attend and hear the lecture; and when there was not even an ordinance of the city or any other law prohibiting the distribution of notice. The police officers, under the domination of the Roman hierarchy, took the law into their own hands and inflicted punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses; and when the courts released these witnesses who have been wrongfully convicted, police officers, still in defiance of the law, threaten to further arrest and imprison anyone who comes to their town to carry on God’s witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A theater building at Plainfield, New Jersey, was rented in which to hold a public lecture on the subject “Why Religious Intolerance Is Practiced Today”. Before the meeting the chief of police, a Roman Catholic, approached the owner of the theater and tried to induce him to cancel the contract, to prevent the meeting. But the owner preferred to receive the rent. When Jehovah’s witnesses were handing out to the people a small slip of paper announcing the lecture a number of these distributors were arrested and thrown into prison, among them a woman more than seventy years of age. Immediately following this certain policemen of Plainfield were overheard discussing the matter and the lecture that was to be delivered on the next day by Judge Rutherford. One of these policemen said to another: “He [undoubtedly referring to Judge Rutherford] will be here tomorrow, and he will get what is coming to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the occasion of the lecture above mentioned, and without invitation from anyone who had to do with the lecture, and without any excuse or reason therefor, about sixty policemen appeared at this theater at Plainfield under the direction of a superior officer, and all of these men, policemen and private detectives were armed with heavy pistols and other deadly weapons, which included sawed-off shotguns, riot guns and other instruments of destruction. They took their positions on the stage and throughout the building and remained in this attitude during the lecture. Before the lecture began police officers tried to provoke the speaker and others into a controversy, with the hope, no doubt, of having an excuse or opportunity to use their guns. The speaker delivered his lecture literally surrounded by many men bearing deadly weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There could have been no reason for this except to coerce the speaker and prevent him from saying his speech. They failed, however, in both purposes. At the conclusion of the lecture two of these policemen seemed ashamed of their action and of being there with armed men, and they said to the speaker: ‘‘We receive our orders, and we have to obey them.&quot; These facts, and many corroborative facts which might be here related, show conclusively that Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones against whom Satan and his agents direct their malicious actions and that such agents are bent on the destruction of those to whom the testimony of Jesus Christ is committed, even as the Lord foretold. (Revelation 12:17) That same class of persons whom Jesus designated as sons of the Devil called Jesus the chief of devils and wickedly persecuted Him, and Jesus declares that His followers must expect the same kind of treatment at the present time. Such is the true setting for His prophetic words: “Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed ; and hid, that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.”—Matthew 10:26,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">True Meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostles of Jesus suffered the very things that the Lord described in the tenth chapter of Matthew, but it is very evident that in so doing they fulfilled the prophecy only in a partial manner and that the greater fulfilment must come upon those who faithfully follow Jesus and who give the final testimony before the on-coming battle of Armageddon. The great issue now before all creation is, Who is supreme, Satan or Jehovah? The world, by the course of action it takes, sides with Satan and persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses because they are the ones who declare Jehovah’s name. The Devil causes this persecution to be carried forward by his agents for the very purpose of intimidating Jehovah’s witnesses and preventing the giving of such testimony. The Lord Jesus now says to His faithful remnant: “Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.” Otherwise stated, Jesus’ words to the faithful remnant now on earth are: ‘Do not fear to tell the truth in the presence of the enemy and his representatives. The Lord has nothing to hide. Let the truth be told. What you hear from Me concerning the Kingdom you are to tell openly.’ What the Lord does He does openly and aboveboard, and He informs Satan and his hordes in advance what He expects to do to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Further then instructing the faithful remnant Jesus says to them: “What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.” What is meant by “darkness”, as used here? Surely it does not mean the wicked deeds of men who steal and murder and do other crimes in the dark. The Lord is making no reference to such a thing. The word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">darkness</span><span class="font7"> here means obscurity, and applies as follows: Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the great spiritual temple of Jehovah (which both Scripture and fact show occurred in the spring of 1918) (Malachi 1:1-3), the Lord has gathered His people on earth unto himself and made them members of the temple class. (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 2:19-22) There in the temple He teaches them through the revealing of the written Word of God, and there (in the temple condition) everything is obscure or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">dark</span><span class="font7"> to those who are on the outside of the temple. The temple class are children of Jehovah and are taught of Him by and through Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple. (Isaiah 54:13) Thus these faithful ones are in “the secret place of the Most High”, foretold in Psalm 91:1, and which is a place of security and protection under the mighty power of Jehovah God. It is in this secret place, the place of obscurity, which place is dark to the worldly ones and especially to Satan’s representatives, that the Lord instructs and teaches His people just what they must do. He discloses to them His purpose and sends them forth to carry it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus was on earth with His apostles He taught them, and the public knew not what He taught them. What He said to His disciples was obscure or in darkness to the others about. Now the faithful remnant is scattered through the land, but all who are in the secret place are in the temple, because they are gathered there by the Lord and there they receive their instruction from the Lord. Jesus Christ, the Head of the temple class, there sets them in this place obscure to the world and says to them: ‘What you hear in this place you are to go out and tell to others, even shout it from the housetops.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What are some of the truths which the Lord has told to those of the temple class and which they ‘have heard in the ear’? Among those great truths are these: That Jehovah is the true God, and the meaning of His name Jehovah has reference to His marvelous purposes toward His creation; that Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s vindicator, to vindicate His name and word; that in 1914 Jesus took His power and began His reign and has cast Satan and his hordes out of heaven (Revelation 12:1-7); that in 1918 the Lord came to the temple, awakened the faithful dead saints, built up “Zion” (Jehovah’s capital organization) (Psalm 102:16) and gathered unto himself the faithful remnant on earth and made them a part of the temple class, and these are made the witnesses of Jehovah; that there are two great organizations in existence, the one righteous and which is Jehovah’s, and the other wicked and which is Satan’s; that the sufferings of the people at the present time do not come from God, but are due to Satan’s wicked operations in his desperate effort to turn all mankind away from God (Revelation 12:12); that the Lord’s people in His holy temple have been brought there for a purpose; that the Lord in His holy temple is dividing the people as sheep and goats (Matthew 25:31-46), and this He is doing by causing the truth to be proclaimed to them, and this proclamation must be made by the remnant who receive their instruction at the temple; that the preparation is now in progress for the battle of the great day of God Almighty and soon that great fight will take place and will result in the destruction of Satan’s organization, which includes all the religious, political and commercial powers on the earth; that those who now take their stand on Jehovah’s side may be spared in that time of tribulation (Zephaniah 2:1-3), and that God’s kingdom under Christ is the only hope of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where have Jehovah’s faithful remnant learned of these truths? In the secret place, in the place that is obscure or dark to the world, that is to say, in the temple of the Lord, and since 1918. Why have they thus been instructed ? Because these are taken out from the world as a people for Jehovah’s name that they might bear witness to the name and purpose of Jehovah. Therefore Jesus says to them: ‘Go out and preach upon the housetops what you have been taught here in the temple; that is to say, make a wide publication of these truths, and do so boldly and joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some will say: “If in the face of so much persecution and opposition we continue to go out amongst the people and publicly tell these truths, then I fear we may be killed.” That is true; and probably many of the faithful will be killed because they continue to faithfully proclaim the truth which they have learned in the secret place of the Most High. Jesus, of course, foreknew these facts, and therefore in the prophecy uttered by Him He said further: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in [Greek; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">g ehenna}”</span><span class="font7"> (Verse 28) The inference to be drawn from these words is that some of the faithful witnesses will be killed. Satan and his agents both visible and invisible can kill Jehovah’s witnesses, and we know that they are trying to do so; but they cannot destroy the very existence (soul) of these faithful ones. Only Jehovah’s Great Executioner, Christ Jesus, can do that. The question is put squarely up to the remnant now: Shall we fear man or fear Jehovah? It is written, in Proverbs 29:25: “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” The fear of man will certainly bring into a snare any who yield to fear. But Jesus speaks of God’s watchcare over the sparrows as an illustration of His care for those who depend upon Him (verse 30), and then for the comfort of the remnant He adds these words: “But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.”— Verse 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s faithful people are surrounded by the enemy and his wicked agents. These wicked ones are using all manner of means to frighten, coerce, browbeat and put in fear, and thus prevent the remnant from delivering the testimony. That there is great danger of bodily harm and physical death there is no doubt; but those of the remnant may at all times have in mind that Jehovah has taken them out from among the nations as His witnesses to bear testimony to His name (Acts 15:14), and that He has given the remnant His name as His witnesses, and to them the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” (Proverbs 18:10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> Let the testimony work which the Lord has committed to His people continue to be given. And let all persons of good will to whom the message of Jehovah now comes join actively in passing that most vital message on to others of the race who are thirsting for the “water of life”.—Revelation 22:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah made man a free agent, holding him responsible for his intelligent acts. Jehovah never prevents man from expressing his mind. Intolerance does not at all apply to Jehovah and those who faithfully obey him. Satan, the enemy, has at all times held men in darkness and attempted to compel them to obey and practice what selfish men have taught them. Satan, the Devil, is the author and promoter of intolerance. Whenever you find men or organizations trying to prevent others from hearing the truth, then you may be certain that such men or organizations are the servants of the Devil, regardless of claims that are made for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No organization should be permitted to stand in your way of getting the truth. If you have been favored in obtaining this truth, no greater privilege could be yours than to help your neighbor. You are invited, therefore, to extend to your neighbors and your friends the truth contained in this booklet or any other publications of the Society, for it will aid them in getting a proper understanding of God’s purposes toward the world of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you desire to associate yourself with a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, write to The Watch Tower, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y., or to any of its branches, in Canada, England, or Australia, and they will be pleased to aid you in getting acquainted. In the meantime, why not obtain a few of the INTOLERANCE booklets and have a part in this witness work?</span></p>

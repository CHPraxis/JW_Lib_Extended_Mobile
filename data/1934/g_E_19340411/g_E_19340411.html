<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">World Control</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chain broadcast from Los Angeles, March 25, 1934, by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font5">OR several years past it has been my privilege to tell the people God’s message of truth as it is set forth in the Bible and to use the radio for that purpose. The truth is not popular, and hence provokes much opposition. Nineteen centuries ago God sent Jesus to earth to deliver His message of truth. Jesus faithfully performed His commission and was crucified for telling the truth. The truth will never be popular until there is a complete change of world control. I beg you to carefully follow my speech now, that you may more fully appreciate why there is such great opposition to the truth and what is the only safe and proper course for the people to take. The people of good will must now hear, because this message is for their special aid and comfort in this day of great world distress. It is not the message of any man, but the message from God’s Word delivered according to His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First I give the Scriptural definition of “world”, and then show you who controls the world and why a change of world control must shortly come to pass. ‘World” means the peoples of the earth organized into forms of government under the supervision of an invisible power or overlord. In the Bible the word “heaven” is used to represent the invisible part of that rule, while “earth”, as there used, means the visible power that rules; and it is “heaven” and “earth” together which constitute the world. The people of good will are those who have an honest and sincere desire to see justice and righteousness control everything, and hence that the will of God may be done on earth and in heaven.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The address on WORLD CONTROL, which begins on this page, was given at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, California, March 25, 1934. It was delivered directly to a cheering audience of 12,000 liberty-loving Americans that unanimously adopted the Resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It was broadcast over the American continent on a special network of 151 stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">As we go to press, word comes from South Africa and from Australia that the speech was heard distinctly In those far-off lands; thus it may truly be said that this address, of worldwide import, echoed in every corner of the entire world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">March 15, 1934, Judge Rutherford, through his attorney, appeared before the Congress of the United States, with the statement found on pages 425-429 of this Issue. It Is his demand for noninterference In the work of Jehovah's witnesses. It is made In the name of Jehovah, the true and living God. It should be heeded, without question, without hesitation.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” is the Supreme Being and the source of righteousness and life. Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the chief executive officer of Jehovah, the Redeemer of man, and the world’s rightful ruler. Satan the Devil is the wicked one, the opposer of God, and man’s greatest enemy. For centuries Satan has been the invisible overlord or controller of the world. There must be a change from Satan’s rule to that by Jesus Christ. That change is impending and will take place within this generation. Now I give you the proof showing how the Devil became the ruler of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God created the earth and put perfect man upon it, and made the spirit creature Lucifer the invisible overlord of the earth. Associated with Lucifer were many spirit creatures or angels forming a part of his immediate organization. Lucifer rebelled against Jehovah God, in which rebellion his host of angels joined, and man was led into lawlessness and sentenced to death. Since the entire human race sprang from that one man after he had sinned and was sentenced to death, all mankind have been born imperfect. (Romans 5:12) God changed the name of Lucifer to that of Devil, Satan, Serpent and Dragon, and since</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">then Satan and his host of wicked angels have controlled the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan defied Jehovah God to put on earth men that would be faithful and true to God. That challenge God accepted. Although sentenced to death Satan and his wicked angels have been permitted to continue for a definite period of time unhindered in the prosecution of their wicked work, God abiding His own due time to take action against them. As the human race increased on the earth, other angels which had been wholly devoted to God materialized in human form and were induced by Satan and his wicked angels to mingle with humankind and marry the daughters of men, and from that union there came forth an unusual offspring. There followed a period of great wickedness in the earth, and God announced His purpose to destroy the “world that then was” by a flood. That time in the Scriptures is called “Noah’s day”, because Noah was a righteous man and remained true to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God then told Noah to build an ark in which he would find refuge for himself and the immediate members of his household. Noah did as commanded, and then there came upon the world the deluge or great flood which destroyed all flesh. That destruction of all flesh was a type foreshadowing the destruction of the present wicked world. The saving of a few persons who found refuge in the ark pictured or foreshadowed the millions of people of good will who will be carried through the battle of the great day of God Almighty soon to be fought. A knowledge of the truth of and concerning these things is now of most vital importance to all persons of good will; hence that message is now declared as a notice and warning to all such people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the flood God destroyed all flesh, but He did not destroy the Devil and the other wicked spirits, but permitted them to continue to exercise power and influence over humankind until God's due time to take action. Why did not God then destroy the Devil? Jehovah’s answer to that question is found in the Bible, at Exodus 9:16, in these words: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> But the day of final reckoning must come, and in that day Satan and his power will be completely destroyed and there will be a complete change in the rulership of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the flood the human race multiplied in the earth and then men began to organize themselves into governments, the first organization being under the leadership of Nimrod. In that government and in every government from then till now three elements have constituted the visible ruling power, to wit, religion, politics and commerce. During all that time Satan the Devil has exercised his subtle power over the men of the nations, defrauded and deceived them, and led them away from the true God. But in all the centuries past God has had a few men on earth who have remained true and faithful to Him, and such men He has caused to be His witnesses in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jehovah organized the people of Israel into a nation for himself and used that nation to foreshadow and foretell His purpose toward the human race. For some time that nation was faithful to God, but in the course of time the rulers and people fell under the wily influence of the Devil, turning away from God, and then that nation was completely destroyed. Israel was a type foreshadowing “Christendom”. The nations of earth now called “Christendom” began to serve Jehovah, but in the course of time those nations fell away from the true worship of God, yielded to the seductive influence of Satan, and became corrupt, and God’s decree is that they shall be completely destroyed at Armageddon, even as Israel was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan, the wily and subtle foe, in order to deceive man, has caused the people to be kept in ignorance of himself and his work, his agents even denying that Satan exists at all. The question which you must determine now is whether you will believe and accept the word of man or believe and accept the truth of the Bible, which is God's Word. This message is addressed to those who believe that the Bible is the Word of God; and it will be a comfort to them, but not to others. Now the world is in great distress; the rulers in every nation under the sun are in very great perplexity. They sense disaster ahead, but do not know the reason why, nor will they give heed to the Bible truth of and concerning the same. Many religious leaders have told you that the present trouble upon the world is a punishment from God, whereas the Scriptures plainly state that Satan the Devil is the one causing the great distress and woe now upon the people. Therefore it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Revelation 12:12) Now I tell you why Satan has brought this great woe upon the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of Satan’s rebellion Jehovah God promised that He would produce a “Seed” that would in due time rule the world in righteousness, destroy Satan and his organization, and bring blessings of peace, prosperity and life to all the peoples and nations of the earth that would do justice and righteousness. That promised “Seed” or Ruler is Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God. Concerning Him it is written: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty [Ruler], The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, . . . The zeal of [Jehovah] of hosts will perform this.” (Isaiah 9: 6, 7) Thus Christ Jesus is identified as earth’s rightful ruler, by and through whom the human race must receive the desired blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In A.D. 33 the man Jesus, after having delivered God’s message of truth to Israel, was killed by Satan’s agents. God then raised Jesus out of death and gave Him life divine and made Him the most exalted one in the universe and appointed Him to the office of King or Ruler of the world. Jesus was required to wait, however, until God’s due time for Him to assume His ruler ship. (Psalm 110:1) When on the earth Jesus declared that He must go away and receive the Kingdom and that He would then come again and set up the Kingdom; and for that reason He taught Christians to pray: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In answer to the question as to what would be the proof of His coming and His kingdom Jesus stated that the world war would mark the beginning of His operations concerning the world. That world war came in 1914 in fulfilment of the prophecy uttered by Jesus. It was in that year that Jehovah God installed Jesus and commissioned Him to rule the world. (Psalm 2:6-12) Christ Jesus is a spirit now, and cannot be seen by human eyes. As Satan has long been the invisible ruler over the world, hence unseen by men, so now his rule must cease and Christ Jesus becomes the invisible ruler and controller of the world. Jehovah God has for centuries suffered or permitted Satan to be the invisible ruler; but now that time limit is up and the end of Satan’s world has come, and the time for Christ Jesus to take over the affairs of the world, and just before He begins the administration of blessings He will destroy the wicked ruler of this world and all who support that wicked ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan knows that it is only a short time until Armageddon, which -will be the final fight by Satan and his angels on one side and Christ Jesus and His angels on the other side, and, knowing this, Satan brings great woe upon the world, his purpose being to turn the people away from the true God and cause their destruction. This is further supported by the words of Jesus, who said that at the end of the world there would be great distress upon earth, with perplexity, and men’s hearts failing them because of things they sense coming upon the world. This is exactly the condition that we see today. The great change from unrighteous to righteous rule or control of the world is impending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing the great danger of world collapse, earthly rulers organized the League of Nations as a substitute for God’s kingdom, and the religious element of the world hails that League of Nations as “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”; which claim is wholly false. Today an organization in America known as “The League of Nations Association, Inc.”, by its president, has issued an appeal to the people to support the League of Nations, and which appeal among other things says: “In a world as dark as this, why blow out the only light there is?” meaning that the League of Nations is the only hope of the world. I warn the people that the League of Nations is the product of Satan, brought forth to deceive the people and blind them to the truth concerning God’s kingdom. The League of Nations is absolutely certain to go down with the other parts of Satan’s organization. God foreknew and foretold this confederacy of nations, and concerning it by His prophet He said: ‘Associate yourselves together, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces. . . . Bind yourselves together, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.’—Isaiah 8:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In giving His answer concerning the evidence proving the end of the world Jesus referred to the League of Nations as that “abomination that maketh desolate”, because it assumes to take the place of God’s kingdom. He said to His followers: ‘When ye shall see the abomination of desolation [which is the League of Nations] stand in the holy place, then flee to God’s kingdom.’ (Matthew 24:15,16) Jesus gives this warning because the League of Nations is Satan’s scheme to blind the people to the truth. All who seek refuge in the League of Nations will come to disaster. God’s kingdom under Christ is the only hope of the human race, and refuge will be found only in God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For more than 1800 years the Israelites were God’s typical people, and it is expressly stated in the Bible that what came to pass in connection with that nation foreshadowed what shall come to pass at the end of the world, where we now are. The nation of Israel began to function while domiciled in Egypt, and there the people of Israel pictured or represented the peoples now on earth who are on the side of God and Christ and who desire to see righteousness control and oppression end. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, represented or stood for Satan, the god or invisible ruler of the wicked world. Pharaoh and the officers of his government heaped great oppression upon the Israelites. Jehovah God sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt to be witnesses to His name and power. Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, while Aaron was a type of Jehovah’s witnesses working under the direction of Christ Jesus. God commanded Moses and Aaron to go before Pharaoh and demand that His people Israel be permitted to serve and worship God in the way that Jehovah had appointed for them. Pharaoh refused to grant that request. Then God commanded Moses to bring plagues upon Egypt, that the rulers and the people might be informed and warned that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that His commandments must be obeyed. In all there were ten plagues that befell Egypt. The ninth plague was that of great darkness over all the land of Egypt except that part where God’s chosen people were, and there the Israelites had complete light, which was a special favor from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now at the end of the world Jehovah has sent Christ Jesus the Greater Moses and has sent forth His witnesses, pictured by Aaron, and commanded that His testimony must be given to the rulers of the world and to the people that Jehovah is the Supreme One and that His people shall be permitted without interference to worship and serve God in the way He has appointed for them. In the year 1919 the religious, political and commercial elements of “Christendom” set up the League of Nations in opposition to God’s kingdom under Christ, and since then all these visible rulers have vigorously opposed Jehovah’s witnesses. At the command of the Lord His witnesses have served notice and warning upon the rulers that the world has ended, and that the kingdom of God is at hand, and have demanded of the rulers that God’s people be permitted without interference to serve and worship Him in the manner Jehovah has appointed for them. The serving of such notice and warning constitutes the fulfilment of the nine plagues of Egypt; which nine prophetic plagues have been fulfilled upon the rulers of the world. As the ninth plague on Egypt was great darkness, just so now the rulers of the world are in great darkness as to God’s purpose, because they refuse to heed God’s truth. This is particularly shown by the fact that the League of Nations is openly claimed to be the only light that now shines on earth. The only exception to this great darkness is that those persons who have taken their stand on the side of God and His kingdom are now enjoying the light of the Word of God and by it are directed in the right course. At the conclusion of the ninth plague upon Egypt Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron: ‘Be gone and see me no more.’ Even so now after the ninth antitypical plague has been served upon the rulers of the world, they have in effect said to Jehovah’s witnesses: ‘Be gone and let us have no more to do with you.’ Pharaoh defied Jehovah God. The rulers of the world are now doing the same thing. They oppose Jehovah’s witnesses and spurn God’s warning, and they reject God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After this, and in harmony with the will of God as He has commanded, Jehovah’s witnesses will give no further notice and warning to the rulers of the world, but must now bring to the attention of the people of good will the message of notice and warning concerning Armageddon and God’s kingdom, even as Moses and Aaron gave special instruction to the Israelites just before the tenth plague came upon Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The firstborn of Egypt under their law constituted a specially favored class; and hence in the prophetic picture the firstborn represented the present visible ruling element of the earth. The tenth and last plague which God sent upon Egypt was this: He sent His angel throughout the land of Egypt and slew every one of the firstborn of the Egyptians, but gave protection to the firstborn of the Israelites because they obeyed His commandment, showing faith in man's Redeemer. The Israelites immediately left Egypt and were pursued by Pharaoh and his official organization, all of which were destroyed in the sea. That foreshadowed or pictured Armageddon, which will mean the complete destruction of Satan’s rule of this world, both visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures reveal that God never takes advantage of the ignorance of anyone, but always gives notice and warning before taking action to vindicate His name. Mark this, that He caused Noah to testify to men and angels of His purpose to destroy the world before He brought the flood, which destroyed the world. He caused Moses and Aaron to give full notice and warning to Egypt, and then came the destruction of that world power. He caused Jesus to give fair notice and warning to the rebellious nation of Israel, and then followed the destruction of that nation. Now Jehovah has caused His witnesses to give full and fair notice and warning to the rulers of this world; and when this witness work is completed, there shall quickly follow the complete destruction of the world. The flood, the destruction of Egypt, and the fall of Jerusalem brought great trouble upon the people, but Jesus declares that Armageddon shall bring upon the world the greatest tribulation ever known, and that it will be the last. (Matthew 24:14,21,22) Hence we may know that the impending battle of Armageddon will be the final and complete execution of Jehovah’s judgment against the picked, both invisible and visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Armageddon will not be fought between men of the nations of earth. Armageddon is the ‘battle of the great day of God Almighty’, in which Christ Jesus and His angels will fight against Satan and his wicked host, and Christ will be completely victorious. Mark now the words of the record in 2 Peter 3, to wit: Tn the last days shall come those who will deny and scoff at the kingdom of God, and for this they willingly are ignorant of the truth, that by the word of God the heavens and earth that were of old, constituting the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished; but the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto [destruction] against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. . . . Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements [visible ruling powers] shall melt with fervent heat.’—2 Peter 3: 3-7,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those inspired words recorded in the Bible tell what shall shortly come upon the world, making a complete end of Satan’s rule, thus clearing the way for the righteous rule of Christ Jesus. Continuing the apostle says: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13) This marks the complete change of world control, the “new heavens” being the Christ or invisible rule, and the “new earth” meaning those faithful men of old from Abel to John the Baptist, who being resurrected as perfect men shall become the visible rulers in the earth; and that rule shall be one of righteousness.-Psalm 45:16; Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Revelation 21 the new rule of the world is symbolically called “the holy city” or organization, and is described as coming down from God out of heaven, which holy and righteous rule under Christ shall bring the greatest blessings to the people. Exercising His supreme power by and through Christ Jesus, Jehovah the great God of the universe will then bless all the people who obey His righteous law. “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things arc passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new: . . . for these words are true and faithful.”—Revelation 21: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again I bring to your attention that the so-called “holy year” has failed to bring the promised peace and prosperity, and that failure of itself should convince the people of good will that God did not authorize the year 1933 to be called a holy year, nor will He answer the prayers of men who try to make it a holy year. Upon earth there is now no peace, and poverty continues to stalk hideously through the land. As Jehovah’s witnesses we have no controversy with men. Our only purpose is to be obedient to God’s commandment to tell the message of truth. As He has commanded this message to be delivered, by His grace we will do it, regardless of opposition; and when we have thus done, our responsibility ends and yours begins. I must tell you that all human schemes to recover the world are certain to fail. The world is sick unto death, and it is going to die. There may be a temporary period of prosperity, but it will be very brief. Jehovah’s decree is that there shall be a complete change of world control, and for this reason the old world must perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the terrible disaster that shall soon come upon the present world all who oppose God will die and will find no possible way of escape. (Jeremiah 25:33-36) Money, property and worldly influence will not avail anyone to buy protection or relief in that time of great trouble. Concerning the same it is written in God's Word: “The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.” (Isaiah 24: 3, 5) The everlasting covenant here mentioned is God’s covenant concerning the sanctity of life. (Genesis 9:1-11) Every nation on earth has grossly violated and willfully broken that covenant by causing the unnecessary and untimely death of human creatures. Examples of such needless bloodstains upon the record of America are the cruel treatment to which the Indians have been subjected, and the wanton slaughter of animals; and which was done chiefly because of greed for gain. The commercial and political elements of the earth have unjustly oppressed and killed millions of human creatures, and the religious element has connived at and condoned such wrongful deeds. God will balance the books at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I warn the people of a wicked conspiracy formed by Satan, and in which conspiracy there are joined the international bankers, the unfaithful clergy, and the conscienceless politicians, among the purposes of which conspiracy are these: To put America in the League of Nations, control the money and all other property, rule the people by the hand of their one-man dictator, destroy the freedom of speech and press, and stop the true worship of God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But be of good courage! The hand of Almighty God at Armageddon will smite all these enemies to the dust!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is the hope of the nations of the earth? Jehovah God points to Christ Jesus, the new Ruler of the world, and says: ‘Behold my servant, in whom my soul is pleased. He shall show righteous judgment to the nations, and in his name shall the nations hope.’ (Matthew 12:18-21) Having been warned, men are at liberty to join whatsoever organization they may wish; but let the people of good will who desire to see righteousness, peace, prosperity and life everlasting on the earth take their stand wholly on the side of God and His kingdom. There is no place of safety anywhere else. To take your stand on Jehovah’s side you do not need to join any human organization, but in the privacy of your home devote yourself to God and His kingdom under Christ. Be diligent to study the Word of truth and learn the way of righteousness. Avoid all controversies and strifes. If riots and revolutions come, keep away from them. Deal honestly and justly with your fellow man, and worship and obey the Almighty God. There are on earth today millions of people of good will who desire to know and to do what is right, and those who follow the instructions given to them in the Word of God may be hid in the time of the great tribulation, and be carried through it safely, and then live for ever on the earth and never die. Hence it can be truly said, “Millions now living will never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Opposers of God’s truth may soon make it impossible for a time for you to hear the message of God’s kingdom by radio, but Jehovah has provided other means. This speech, and others containing His message electrically transcribed, will be delivered to the people in every part of the land. Look for notice of such coming meetings and then assemble yourselves together and hear the truth and learn the way of righteousness. The change of world control just at hand not only will bring relief to suffering humanity but will bring boundless blessings and endless joy to those who obey God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All who desire the righteous kingdom of Jehovah under Christ, and who are seeking safety, must take their stand now on the side of Jehovah. I propose that this audience, visible and invisible, adopt the following resolution, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved, That we do now take our stand on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom; and that we will obey, serve and worship Jehovah God and His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, who is the rightful Ruler of the world, and we will thus participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Judge Rutherford’s Statement to Congress</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font5">ORE details appear on subsequent pages, but the outstanding event connected with the hearings on the McFadden bill, H.R. 7986, before the House of Representatives Committee on Merchant Marine, Radio, and Fisheries, Washington, D.C., March 15-20, 1934, was the following statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being in California for his health, and confronted with the fact that he was widely advertised to speak over a nation-wide network from the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, March 25, Judge Rutherford was unable to be present, but after his affidavit was read for the record, it was placed in evidence by his attorney. The committee gave this closest attention, and we urge the same upon all our readers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Congress of the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Seventy-third, Second Session Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">STATEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Supporting House Bill H.R. 7986</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The undersigned, Joseph F. Rutherford, makes the following statement under oath:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My name is Joseph F. Rutherford, my residence 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. Temporarily I am at San Diego, California. I am, and since 1917 have been, the president of the following organizations or corporations, to wit: Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Peoples Pulpit Association, International Bible Students Association, all of which are in fact one and the same and engaged in identically the same work, being organized in different places and under different names for convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the year 1879 a company of Christian people at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, formed themselves into an organization under the name of Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society, and in the year 1884 by process of law became incorporated by that name and title. In 1896, by order of the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, duly entered of record, the name of the corporation was changed to that of Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. In 1909 the Peoples Pulpit Association was created and organized under the Membership Corporation law of the State of New York. The term International Bible Students Association was a generic term applied to all people of a common faith in different countries of the earth who were associated together in a specific Christian work, and in the year 1914 a corporation was formed under the laws of England by that name. The term “Society” is often used to designate these Christian people in united body engaged in their specific work under the direction of the corporation above named. Seeing that Jehovah God’s chief purpose w<sup>r</sup>as and is to take out from the nations a people for His name to be used for His witnesses these Christian people, by the Lord’s favor, have taken the name Jehovah’s witnesses and are generally known throughout the earth by that name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PURPOSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sole purpose of the organizations above mentioned is to serve Jehovah God as He has commanded in His Word, the Bible, which requires all who have devoted themselves to Jehovah God to be obedient to His laws or commandments. The persons of this Association or organization are taught and firmly believe that there is one Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and whose name alone is Jehovah, which latter name specifically means His purpose towards His creatures; that there is one Redeemer of mankind, the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who is the Son of Jehovah God. We accept and believe and teach the Bible, which is otherwise designated the Holy Scriptures, and this we understand to be the Word of God given for the instruction of man in the way of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have no formal creed such as is formulated and promulgated by other organizations. We believe the Bible and that is our creed. We put forth no effort to obtain members, nor to propagate the doctrine of any human organization. The Bible teachings which we fully accept we understand to be the following, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God created the earth and created the first man perfect and placed him on the earth; that God made His spirit creature Lucifer the overlord of man; that Lucifer rebelled against God and thereafter his name was changed from Lucifer to Satan, Serpent, Dragon and Devil; that Satan induced man to sin against Jehovah’s law, and for that wrongdoing man was sentenced to death, and all the human race, being the offspring of that first man Adam, by reason of inherited sin, were born as sinners or imperfect; that Satan challenged Jehovah God to put on earth men that would maintain their integrity toward Him and be faithful to God under the severe test; that God permitted Satan to live and carry on his rebellious work in order that his challenge might be fully put to the test and in due time for ever settled in the right way, and that a testimony might be given to all creation to the name of Jehovah in order to give opportunity for men to voluntarily take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and live or choose to take their stand on the side of the Devil and be destroyed. The great climax must be reached at some time, and that is now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To carry out His side of the question put at issue by the challenge Jehovah promised that He would send to earth a redeemer of man, which redeemer would purchase the human race, and in God's due time would establish over the earth a government of righteousness and under which all men might have the opportunity for everlasting life and happiness; that God sent His beloved Son Jesus to the earth for this purpose; that the death of Jesus provided the redemptive price for man; that Jesus was raised from the dead a divine creature and made Jehovah’s chief representative in the universe and the rightful Ruler of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures further plainly set forth and teach that men have formed governments from time to time and endeavored to carry them forward and that Satan, exercising his subtle and wrongful influence over men, has influenced them and caused and induced their governments to become corrupt and to dishonor the name of Jehovah God; that Satan, carrying on this unrighteous work, has overreached religious organizations and has used them as his chief means to deceive the people, as well as the rulers, and to turn them away from the true God, and hence the world in general has come under the wrongful influence and domination of Satan the Devil; that the majority of men are ignorant of this great fact and it is God’s will that testimony should be given concerning the same, that men may understand the truth thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures plainly show that in Jehovah’s due time Jesus must come again and set up His kingdom of righteousness; that the time of His coming might be known by men who were watching and waiting therefor the Scriptures declare that this time should be marked by a world war, accompanied by pestilence and great distress and perplexity upon the nations of the world; that in 1914 this prophecy concerning the end of the world and the coming of the Lord’s kingdom began to have fulfilment and the understanding thereof became possible only after that date; that Jesus Christ approximately at that time cast Satan the Devil down to earth and for that reason there is now great suffering, woe and distress upon the nations and peoples of the earth, and that Satan is the primary cause of such distress and suffering and he brings this upon men in order to turn them away from the true God and His kingdom; that just now Satan is gathering all the nations, and particularly the nations of “Christendom”, to the great battle of Armageddon, at which battle Satan’s organization will be completely destroyed; that according to the Scriptures that will be the greatest tribulation the world has ever known and will be the end of all trouble upon the earth; that following Armageddon peace and prosperity, happiness and life will come to men who are obedient and that the obedient will abide for ever upon earth and there will never be another war; that the great battle of Armageddon is impending and that it will come to pass within the present generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible further teaches, which we accept and believe, that Jehovah has commanded that within the period of time from A.D. 1914 until the battle of Armageddon the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth must be witnesses for Jehovah and must inform the rulers and the people of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy the wicked rule of earth and in its place and stead to establish His government of righteousness under Christ Jesus for the blessing of all the nations of the earth. To this end, therefore, Jehovah God commands His witnesses to proclaim and teach that the millions of people who have died are not in purgatory, nor in a place called hell, nor are they conscious in any place, but that they are dead, in the grave, know not anything, and hence are not undergoing suffering anywhere; that during the reign of Christ Jesus all who are in their graves or the state of death shall be resurrected and be given an opportunity to take their stand on the side of the Lord and obey Him and live for ever on earth; that the Bible shows conclusively that, since the dead are actually unconscious and out of existence, no man or men can offer prayers in behalf of the dead, and that prayers of men offered for the dead are wholly without value and avail nothing; that all prayers must be made to God in the name of Christ Jesus, and only God can forgive sins in answer to prayers; that Jehovah God alone is the life-giver, and hence that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">is the Father (because “father” means life-giver), and He alone can bestow the blessings which men </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sore</span><span class="font5">ly need; that under Christ Jesus ’ reign these blessings will come, and for this reason Jesus taught His followers to pray, ‘Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as in heaven, ’ and since then all of His true followers have thus and sincerely prayed to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible further teaches, and which teachings we accept and strive to obey, that those who are devoted to God must proclaim the good news concerning the kingdom of God both to the rulers and to the people and to inform them as taught by the Scriptures that the only hope of the world is God’s kingdom, and that this testimony must be given, not for the purpose of converting men of the world now, but as a witness in order that those who desire may serve God and live or refuse to serve Him and lose that great privilege; that as soon as this witness work is completed there will follow the great tribulation of Armageddon; and following Armageddon will come the resurrection of the dead and the blessing of the people of the earth who obey the laws of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The teaching of these Bible truths as commanded by the Lord has caused religious leaders to become greatly angered at us, for the reason that these Bible truths make known the fact that the people have been taught many doctrines which are not supported by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bi</span><span class="font5">ble and hence the people have been deceived greatly to their injury. For this reason leaders in religious denominations have launched an active campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses. We have no controversy with any man and we have no fight with any man, but we must be obedient to Jehovah’s commandments and declare His truth as set forth in His Word, and it is His Word of truth that has caused the great opposition to our work and has resulted in much persecution of the faithful and harmless Christian people who have engaged in this work of proclaiming the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radio is the creation of God, and not of any man; hence it is our God-given privilege and duty to use the radio to proclaim the truth which is set forth in the Bible, in order that the people might hear, and this we have been doing. The truth proclaimed by radio has exposed the errors taught by men, and therefore it is the truth that has caused the opposition to our using the radio. Instead of replying to the teachings which we have been promulgating from the Scriptures the opposers seek to destroy our opportunity of using the radio for that purpose and to try to deprive the people of having the opportunity of hearing these truths by radio. Repeatedly I have offered to discuss these Bible questions with the clergymen by radio, not for the purpose of holding up anyone to ridicule, but that the people might for themselves determine what they desire to believe, but all such requests for such a public discussion have been ignored and the opposition to our work has increased in the manner above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The very existence of the governments and peoples of the earth is now at stake, and for that reason there could be nothing of such public and vital importance to the people as a correct knowledge and understanding of Jehovah God’s purpose of and concerning them. If the people go the wrong way they shall surely die; whereas if they go in the right way they may receive the blessings of life. Hence the message of God’s kingdom proclaimed as set forth in the Bible comes clearly within the purview of the Radio Act concerning public interest, convenience and necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many radio stations have gladly broadcast our programs, and during the past three years there has been a wide proclamation of the truth in this way, and this has afforded to the radio stations much legitimate revenue, since we have paid for the broadcasting of sueh programs. In that time millions of people have heard these Bible instructions and have rejoiced, and these truths have helped them to be better men and women. Such has been the expression by many thousands both of Catholics and Protestants, Jews and non-Jews. It must be conceded that the people have the right to hear what they please without interference from anyone, and as long as that which is broadcast is moral and upbuilding, and for the good of those who hear, surely no one has any right to interfere with the proclamation of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic people as such are not against the message which we proclaim, and this is evidenced by the numerous letters received from Catholics in various parts of the country. Many of them have expressed their great desire to hear more, and thousands of them are reading that message that is in printed form. It is the priests or clergymen and officials of the Catholic organization that have engaged and carried on and are carrying on a vigorous and vituperative campaign against us. That they have a right to abuse us no one will call in question, but they do not have any right to employ the means of boycott, of threats and coercion, against radio stations in order to force such stations to cease taking and broadcasting our programs. The Catholic press and the Catholic clergymen throughout the country are employing these very wrongful methods and threaten business loss and disaster to radio stations in order to prevent them from taking and broadcasting our programs and thus are depriving the people of hearing them as well as depriving the radio stations of legitimate right to broadcast such things as they may deem proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not here asking for any favor of Congress, but we are here demanding that our rights and the rights of the general public be safeguarded and that men and organizations be prohibited from employing threats to destroy the business of radio stations and using that and like coercive methods to compel radio stations to deny us the use of their facilities. We will be the last ones to ever complain to opposition to us, but we do insist that we have the right under the fundamental law of this land, and, above all, under the law of God, to contract with the owners of radio stations to broadcast our programs and that such stations have the right to freely contract with us without interference or fear of suffering loss at the hands of other persons or organizations. For that reason we are asking this Congress to make it a criminal offense for any person or organization to use threats, boycotting or other coercive methods to hinder or interfere with the free making and performance of contracts between persons or organizations with reference to radio broadcasting. Such a rule of law is general and for the general welfare, and not in the interest of any particular organization, and every honest and law-abiding person should be in favor of such a law. It extends the same privilege and protection to all, regardless of religious faith or previous condition of servitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With elaborate pontifical ceremonies the year 1933 was declared to be a holy year in which united prayers should be made to bring to the world peace and prosperity. In a radio speech I called attention to this as being presumptuous before the Lord, since no man has any power or authority to declare a year a holy year. That proper and legitimate and Scriptural criticism of “Holy Year’’ called forth from the Catholic press a tirade of abuse and vilification against me and repeated threats to destroy the business of radio stations that would dare to continue to broadcast speeches made by me. Concerning the personal abuse of myself I have no complaint; but threats made against owners and lessees of radio stations who broadcast such programs as they desire, and therefore putting such owners and lessees in fear of loss of business or social support, and which resulted in depriving millions of people of hearing what they wish to hear, is so grossly wrong that it demands the serious attention of Congress. Let the Roman Catholic clergy believe and teach what they desire, but when they attempt to tell American citizens what they may or may not hear or what they may and may not do, and employ threats, boycott and coercive means to accomplish their wrongful purpose, then it is that the law-making body of this land should take positive action for the protection of American interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely it has not come to the point in America that the people are permitted only to hear one side of an important question at issue. The so-called “Holy Year” has come and passed, and the united prayers of the political religious institutions have resulted in bringing neither prosperity nor peace to the world, but, on the contrary, wars are threatened and poverty continues to stalk abroad in the earth. Jehovah God in the Bible has told why these unhappy conditions are here and what will be the outcome thereof. Is it not of greatest public interest, convenience and necessity that the people hear these truths?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No religious, political or financial institution has the Constitutional right to use the Federal Radio Commission either directly or indirectly in an attempt to frighten the owners or lessees of radio stations and thus cause them to refrain from broadcasting certain or specific programs which they have the legal right to broadcast. A case in point is this: After broadcasting my speech on “Holy Year” by a large number of radio stations in the United States, and after the Catholic press and the clergy had launched a vigorous attack upon me and against the radio stations that had broadcast the same, and after the clergy had made vigorous protest to the Federal Radio Commission against such speech, then the Federal Radio Commission requested me to file with it a list of stations that had broadcast that speech and to furnish a copy of the speech to the Federal Radio Commission, which request I readily complied with. After all of this, and after the Commission had been furnished the information requested, then the Federal Radio Commission addressed letters to numerous radio stations, the names of which stations were on the list I had furnished to the Commission, requesting such stations to advise the Commission as to whether or not they had broadcast my speech concerning the “Holy Year”. The manifest purpose of such letters to the various stations was not to obtain information asked for, but was an indirect way of advising such radio stations that further broadcasting of such speech by myself might be grounds for refusing to renew their license. That some of the stations so understood and construed those letters, I know to be true, because managers of radio stations so expressed themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the guidance of the Federal Radio Commission and for the public interest Congress therefore should so amend Section 11 of the Radio Act as to clearly define the meaning of the phrase therein, to wit: “public interest, convenience and necessity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the Roman Catholic hierarchy be permitted to determine what is of public interest, convenience and necessity and can by means of threats or other wrongful means prevent radio stations’ broadcasting what is displeasing to such religious organization, then the Roman-Spanish inquisition will be in full force in America, even though in a somewhat more refined form, and the freedom of speech in this land will cease. The Congress should take positive action, not in behalf of or against any religious organization, but in behalf of the people in general, to safeguard the interest and the rights of the people which are guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With us it is not at all material, nor do we care if the Catholic institution increases its followers by the millions, because that responsibility is upon that organization and the men who conduct it, and they must account to Jehovah God, and not to us. We are commanded by Jehovah God to sound His notice and warning to the rulers and to the people concerning His name, the establishment of His kingdom, and what shall shortly fall upon the world, and this we must do in order to meet the responsibility laid upon us, and all who oppose the proclamation of such message of truth will receive a just recompense at the hand of Jehovah God. The obligation now resting upon this Congress is to see that no hindrance is put in the way of a free proclamation of God’s Word, and that obligation cannot be side-stepped or met by merely ignoring it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two gigantic radio corporations in America owning, leasing and operating radio stations, to wit: The National Broadeasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System. These corporations, by their officers, have undertaken to determine what the American people may or may not hear with reference to what the Bible contains, and hence have limited the use of their facilities to certain religious organizations and have unjustly discriminated and do unjustly discriminate against all others, including ourselves, and which is detrimental to the interest of millions of American citizens. Such radio corporations have denied the use of their facilities to us for hire because what we teach is not pleasing to certain religious organizations, which organizations they do favor. Such unjust discrimination should not be permitted, and this Congress should take the necessary steps to prevent such discrimination. The rights </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the people are supreme to that of any organization or corporation, and the right of the minority </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cannot </span><span class="font5">be properly ignored. Unless this Congress takes action as here suggested, then millions of people will be denied the opportunity of hearing God’s Word of truth and this Congress will bear a great responsibility therefor before Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We call attention to these facts which are fully supported by God’s Word the Bible, and by the physical facts which are now apparent to all, that it may be seen that the world has reached a great crisis, and that no man knows the way out, but God’s Word furnishes and clearly points to the only way out and the only possible way of escape to safety; that God has commanded that these facts must be brought to the attention of the rulers and to the people themselves, and a failure of God’s witnesses to so do would cost them their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this hour of great crisis upon the world, and when the people are in such dire need of knowledge and understanding of God’s Word of truth, every effort should be put forth to give the people an opportunity to hear and understand the Bible truths. No person, persons, companies or corporations should be permitted to put in fear owners and lessees of radio stations and thus wrongfully prevent the people from hearing by radio the all-important message of Jehovah’s Word. Having brought these matters to your attention our responsibility ends and there yours begins. In all kindness I suggest that before passing finally upon the question raised by the petitions filed in support of this Bill you give due consideration to the fact that Christ Jesus is earth’s rightful King under Jehovah God; that His kingdom is at hand, and that this matter of notice and warning is given to you in harmony with the expressed will of God, as set forth in the prophecies, and, these facts having been brought to your attention, such adds greatly to your responsibility, as declared in the following and many other supporting Scriptures, to wit: Ezekiel 3; 18-21; Psalm 2:6-12.</span></p><img src="g_E_19340411_files/g_E_19340411-2.png" alt="" style="width:134pt;height:47pt;">

<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Other Items of Interest at the Hearings on the McFadden Bill</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE skill with -which The Associated Press and the other press agencies deprived the American people of any knowledge of the greatest petition ever presented in the history of legislation, or of the hearings which followed its presentation, is noteworthy. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun, </span><span class="font5">Baltimore, is an exception. From a report two columns long, published on the first day of the hearings, we quote some of the colloquy which, if The Associated Press wished at all to serve 2,416,141 who signed the Protest and Petition, presented to Congress January 24, 1934, would have been published in every newspaper in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A committee consisting of representatives of the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish faiths have banned Jehovah’s witnesses, said Wertz.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Do Jehovah’s witnesses attack the Boman Catholic church?” asked Eepresentative John Brown (Dem., Ky.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“They attack the doctrines of the Catholic church,” said Wertz. “Not the individuals of that church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OPERATES SMALL STATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah's witnesses, under the title of the Peoples’ Pulpit [Association], operate a small radio station at Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses now operate in sixty-one countries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“How do they get financial support?” asked Representative Gifford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By voluntary contributions,” replied Wertz. “The income of the head of Jehovah’s witnesses and of all its workers is limited to $15 a month and board and room.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“How many adherents has the organization?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“About 15,000,000 people in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTERPRETS BIBLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“These adherents of Jehovah’s witnesses,” went on Wertz, “are made up of Catholics, Protestants and Jews.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">•Mr. Edwin S. Wertz, attorney, of Cleveland, Ohio, represented Jehovah’s witnesses before the Radio Committee of the House of Representatives, at Washington, D.C., in the hearings on the McFadden bill, March 15-20, 1934. Mr. Wertz has his law offices In the Union Trust Building, Cleveland. He was selected as a lawyer of ability in whom Judge Rutherford has confidence, as to both his ability and his honesty. He has represented Jehovah’s witnesses In Ohio and other states. He was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio during President Wilson's administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McFadden’s bill forbids discrimination and censorship in the use of radio and makes its violation a misdemeanor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to be </span><span class="font4">punished by a fine of not more than $5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McFadden, who was the first witness, said that at present the radio company did discriminate both between political candidates and between religions and other organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He said that petitions signed by 2,416,000 citizens had been Bgnt in to Congressmen, protesting against the existing censorship. He went on to declare that much radio advertising was really political propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUMPS INTO BIG BUSINESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Getting well under way McFadden read a scorching attack on “big business’’, which, he said, had turned “the toiling millions’’ into “serfs and paupers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* ‘ Every branch of the Government, ’ ’ McFadden declared, “is controlled and contaminated by big business, which, also, controls the army and navy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Did big business elect Boosevelt!” asked Eepresentative Charles L. Gifford (Bep., Mass.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ I think it had a good deal to do with it, ’ ’ replied McFadden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McFadden went on to say that “big business owns or controls practically all the newspapers and magazines and all the clergymen of the country”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Did the distinguished gentleman call the attention of the country to these dangers while he was chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee of the House!” asked Eepresentative William I. Sirovich (Dem., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">N. Y.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yes,” replied McFadden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What specific clergymen does the speaker refer to!” persisted Sirovich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ I mean the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America,” said McFadden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HITS AT INTERNATIONALISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I object to intolerance in the use of the radio,” he declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What do you mean by ‘intolerance’ on the radio!” asked Sirovich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I mean the spreading on the radio of propaganda for internationalism,” said McFadden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Would you favor a few clear channels on the air to be owned and operated by the Government! ’ ’ asked Sirovich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That may become necessary,” McFadden replied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTS CRITICISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Have you been invited to speak over the radio on the subject of your bill!” asked Eepresentative Gifford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ No, ’ ’ replied McFadden, ‘ ‘ but a year or two ago when 1 introduced another radio bill, the Bev. D. Parks Cadman severely criticized me, but I was not given an opportunity to reply.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WANTS “UNIVERSITY OF AIR”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sirovich said he was working on a bill which would create ‘ ‘ the national university of the air ’ ’, and under which the most eminent men in politics, science and education would address the public over air channels now controlled by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Are there instances where the Eadio Commission has suggested to announced speakers that they had better not speak!” asked Gifford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I think later witnesses will so testify,” said McFadden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The British government controls the radio,” said Gifford. “Does the Government cut off its political opponents from the air!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I understand there have been such charges,” replied McFadden. “And in this country, also, I have been told, static or other conditions have stopped certain political addresses. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have been told,” went on McFadden, “that witnesses have testified that Station WGY is controlled by the National Broadcasting Company and that no religious addresses of any kind can be put on the air over that station until such addresses have been approved by the censorship committee of the Federation of Churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTS INTERNATIONAL MOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There is a movement on foot to control all means of communication internationally. I understand that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company controls radio in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chairman Schuyler O. Bland (Dem., Va.) quoted from the radio law the clause which forbids a radio company to exercise censorship over what is spoken over the radio and, further, the provision that if one candidate is given time, his opponents must be given equal time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McFadden said that the National Broadcasting Company had allotted certain time for religious addresses and that it insisted that all such addresses must be approved by the Federation of Churches of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bamspeck went on to ask if the securities act, the Stock Exchange Control act and other legislation proposed by the Boosevelt administration were not bitterly opposed by big business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANSWERED BY COMMITTEE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McFadden agreed that certain sections of big business did not approve such legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have been told that the bank deposit insurance bill,” said McFadden, “was passed practieaBy at the demand of investment bankers, who were responsible for looting the banks and were afraid to face the suffering depositors.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Statement of Anton Koerber</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have been asked the question by members of Congress and others, “Is the petition as recently presented by millions of American citizens an anti-Catholic movement, and are Jehovah's witnesses in favor of H.R. 7986 for any such reason?’’ The answer is emphatically “No”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no act or intention on the part of American citizens (including Jehovah’s witnesses) who signed this petition to restrain or interfere with the rights of any class of people, be they Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish, but, on the other hand, the petition protests against certain acts on the part of the clergy (including those of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy) who have by unethical practices sought to restrain and interfere with the rights of others in the free worship and service to God in the use of the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of the petition and its signers is not associated with any movement </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> agitate or arouse a religious controversy, but rather is a cry for relief from the oppression fostered by organized clergy and the principal of their flock, namely, big business, who use the God-given ether waves for their own selfish interests and the clergy as mouthpieces in suppressing the Kingdom message. We see nothing in the bill that deprives any of their rights as American citizens. The bill proposes legislation to prohibit lawless forces from further covetousness and overt acts that result in the dispossession of those rights. The bill further provides certain safeguards to protect the inherent rights of the American people in the worship and service to God according to the dictates of their own conscience without interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question must come to your mind, “Why should the clergy of all people, who claim to represent God and the Bible, seek to throttle and prevent others from expressing freely God’s purposes as stated in the Scriptures, except it be through fear of exposure?” The love of God casts out all fear, and truthful persons are bold to both hear and proclaim the Word of God. (1 John 4:17,18) We are warned that the clergy in the Lord’s day had a form of godliness but denied God’s Word of truth. (2 Timothy 3:5) The clergy killed God’s prophets, crucified Christ Jesus, imprisoned and killed the disciples, and used the Inquisition during the Middle Ages. (John 8:40-44) Organized clergy of the present generation is no different from the past. The veneer is simply more polished, but the same wicked intention to exclude or destroy anyone who interferes with their selfish schemes to control the people persists today.—Matthew 23 : 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Congressman is granted certain powers by election relative to laying out a course of action for the people to pursue, but the clergy and the principal of their flock have assumed that power by usurpation. Today the people are dominated by these factors and have no voice and are given no choice in the matter because their rights are not protected by those who have the authority to do so. Oppression is rampant under the guise of religion. The great Creator did not make His creatures to live upon the earth under such conditions forever, and the Scriptures give abundant evidence that the time has come when all will be granted the right to serve God in spirit and in truth with open hearts and minds, unhindered by religious prejudice. Therefore it is a most opportune time for those who love God and desire to do good to their fellow man to boldly declare these facts to the people and open the way for a better understanding among those who desire to serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither the Catholic, Protestant, nor Jewish people, as such, are involved or guilty of the wicked practices to exclude and restrain freedom of political, religious or educational expressions by radio, nor have they given unfavorable expression against certain Scriptural programs of speech which seem to have incensed the clergy. Rather, the very message that has incensed the clergy has brought comfort to millions of people of good will. These people are glad to know that God’s kingdom, for which they have long prayed, is now at hand, and that the blessings to all the families of the earth, which God promised, are now available. To receive these blessings at God’s hand, all must put their trust in Jehovah God and have knowledge of His purposes. Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in giving the message of God’s kingdom unselfishly by pointing to His Word, as expressed in the Bible, as the only lawful course of action to follow. This is referred to in the Watch Tower charter as “the dissemination of Bible truths”. We hold that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world. Organized clergy, including the Catholic hierarchy, have proved that they are against God’s kingdom, because they have taken every possible step to estop the message of God</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’s </span><span class="font5">kingdom, which Jehovah through Christ Jesus has commanded shall be given for the vindication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">Word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In each case of a number of stations, either a Catholic priest or Protestant clergyman has been responsible for the unethical campaign to exclude others from the air. The complaints were entirely a case </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">personal animosity. That they have the right to abuse others under the cloak of religious immunity is not questioned here. But they do not have the right, in order to carry out their malicious purposes, to employ such means as threats, boycott and coercion to the detriment of business firms who advertise, radio stations which broadcast, and the people who desire to hear what they consider to be a proper expression of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, if Congress has not deemed it advisable </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">grant to the Radio Commission the right of censorship, surely that power cannot be exercised by the clergy without legislation. For the latter class to assume that role without legal authority is lawlessness in the extreme. As American citizens the clergy have no more rights than any other Americans, and therefore should be restrained from such wicked practices the same as others. The fact that one person, because he is a pope or cardinal, can say anything he wishes without interference does not preclude another from contradicting the former’s statements because such matters are considered controversial and an insult to the pope. Whether a man is a pope, cardinal, international banker or an honest workingman, the laws of this country place all on the same footing and the Constitution of the United States prescribes protection to Americans from just such a condition as exists today in radio matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We understand the proposed legislation in the McFadden Radio Bill H.R. 7986, carries no selfish privileges in favor of any. It cannot possibly be construed as favoring any particular person or organization, but rather affords equal opportunity for all to contribute to the welfare of others in giving a square deal in broadcasting, relative to the important points at issue. It provides that station owners shall have the free exercise of their rights to contract for legitimate programs without interference by disinterested parties, and prohibits </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">undue</span><span class="font5"> discrimination in behalf of one party to the exclusion of another when all conditions should be considered equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above-stated features in the bill, together with the provisions of protection against threats, coercion and boycott are surely for the welfare of all and not in the interest of any in particular. The bill extends the same privilege and measure of protection to all, regardless of their political views, religious faith and charitable efforts. It expresses that portion of the Constitution that should apply to radio today relative to good government and freedom of worship and service to God. That the Roman Catholic hierarchy and other clergy have the right to express by radio and otherwise certain views throughout European nations as well as the United States without interference is not questioned here. But surely others have a right to express contrary views based upon the Scriptures without interference by the clergy element or any other element because the facts expressed are contrary to the views of the clergy. The Constitution and laws of the United States contain certain provisions to protect the inherent rights of American citizens against monopolies, whether the latter be of religious or of commercial element. Today both of the latter are operated on a commercial basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The creatures in this country who are walking humbly before the living God and seeking to do good to their neighbors have an undeniable right to unselfishly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ without molestation. This right of freedom of expression and freedom of participation for others to express Jehovah God’s purposes concerning us is now claimed in the proposed legislation of H. R. 7986. For this reason we are in favor of it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Statement by A. R. Goux</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In the statement which follows NBC stands for National Broadcasting Company and CBS for Columbia Broadcasting System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">NBC began operations in 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CBS began operating in 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the time that NBC and CBS controlled only a few stations we were able to make up our own chain and could get by fairly well with the dissemination of our program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent years both of these systems have expanded by acquiring other powerful stations. These chain companies also acquired by contract a prior claim on practically all the desirable time on independently owned stations. Therefore at the present time these two chain companies control practically all of the powerful stations in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Owing to refusal of these chain systems to carry our programs on their networks, we are compelled to make up a separate chain of smaller stations, or stations with small power and a short radius of trans</span><span class="font5">mission. This greatly increases our expense by compelling us to carry more telephone-line connections to get the required greater number of stations to cover the listening areas as far as practicable by means of the smaller stations than could be covered if we had free access to the powerful stations used by NBC and CBS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the stations we are compelled to use now have little sending capacity. We are unable to cover the same areas with the use of these small stations as we could cover by use of the larger stations. We are compelled to expend larger sums of money and we do not get the service, nor do we provide the programs for all who desire to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today these chains monopolize the United States by station ownership and by preferred option of time on independently owned stations that have been assigned to use the choice operating frequencies and the high power. Those chain-controlled stations have the capacity to reach all listening areas of the United States at any time, to the exclusion of the other stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent years a regional chain was organized, known as the Yankee network, covering New England. This chain is now associated with CBS. The Yankee network includes smaller stations with preferential contracts as to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The city of Washington has a powerful CBS outlet in WJSV; it has also two NBC outlets, WMAL and WRC; it has also one independently owned station of low power, WOL. We are prevented from using any one of these four stations. WOL declines to broadcast our programs for fear of incurring the disfavor of the Federal Radio Commission. The two chain systems dominate the other three Washington stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of the populous areas of the United States we are unable to reach; such as Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, New England, even with the smaller stations, due to the preferred option of time held by the chains on the stations that have adequate sending capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The NBC service was used by us on one occasion: July 24, 1927. This was a one-hour program, broadcast by 51 stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since then we have never been permitted to use that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason given for the NBC refusal was that their broadcasting enterprise is conducted primarily for commercial purposes, and that we would have to take the matter up with their Advisory Council. This Advisory Council includes a religious policy committee composed of three members: a representative of the Catholic faith; one of the Protestant faith; and one of the Jewish faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This committee of the Advisory Council is designated as the Committee on Religious Activities, and to </span><span class="font5">it the NBC has entrusted the responsibility of governing the broadcasting of programs connected with religion or the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This committee has always refused to permit us to use the service of the NBC to broadcast our programs of Bible instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The committee refuses our programs, saying that the NBC networks are adequately provided with religious program material furnished and approved by their committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have requested NBC to broadcast our programs. Such requests have been made repeatedly since 1927. We have offered to pay for the time at commercial rates and have always been refused, except the first time, July 24, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COLUMBIA BROADCASTING SYSTEM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CBS refuses to accept our programs, stating that it is contrary to their policy to accept programs of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CBS has never broadcast our programs on its networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last November we entered into a contract with WPG, Atlantic City, New Jersey, for a one-hour program in electrical transcription, to be broadcast December 31, 1933, on the subject “Religious Intolerance: Why’’. Before the date of the broadcast we were informed by the manager of WPG that the CBS had written to him and advised him to cancel the contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides owning a number of stations, directly or through its subsidiary corporations, the CBS has prior claim on time of many independently owned stations, through contracts with such stations which are highly restrictive according to information given us from time to time by the stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For example, independently owned stations located at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Birmingham, Ala, Montgomery, Ala. Boston, Mass.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Tacoma, Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wheeling, W. Va.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">had reported to us their readiness to carry our program on March 25, 1934. The station at Akron, Ohio, had given us similar report and had even signed a contract to take our program. Later we were advised by each of these stations that they would be unable to accept our program on March 25, 1934, for the reason that the CBS claimed a prior right to the time which we desired to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Stations at Wichita (Kansas) and Indianapolis (Indiana), independently owned and associated under contract with CBS network, advised us that their contract with the CBS strictly forbids them the right to broadcast any chain program other than the Columbia chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The station at Memphis (Tennessee), WREC, which has carried our programs for many years, was anxious to clear the half-hour period required by us for the March 25 private network broadcast. The station </span><span class="font5">requested permission of the CBS to take off the regular commercial-chain feature for that date only. This request to CBS was telephoned by the general manager of the station and, according to our local representative’s report, the request was flatly refused and the station manager refuses further to consider removing the CBS program for our program for fear of what CBS might do in retaliation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Statement of C. J. Woodworth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In support of verbal testimony given here, I would like to show the Committee how the organization referred to in the “Petition” as the Roman Catholic hierarchy operated in this country to exclude from the air, by unethical methods, programs of speech by Judge Rutherford because his expressed views differed from those of the Catholic hierarchy and were considered inimical to the latter’s interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is well known that the pope is the visible head of the Roman Catholic organization. It may be interesting to know that there are 310 official Catholic publications in this country which the pope freely admits is his voice in America. The editors of these papers are chiefly bishops and priests. However, their publications and activities are not confined to religion, but cover commercial, political and social life. In addition, there are some 35 Catholic organizations of men, such as the Knights of Columbus, and approximately 75 Catholic organizations of women in this country, which cooperate with and support the Catholic press and Catholic programs. Their expressed purpose is for the advancement of Catholic interests and the suppression and abolition of other parties considered inimical to Catholic interests. In other words, if any religious, educational or political organizations publish or broadcast what is considered by the Catholic hierarchy as inimical to Catholic interests in this country, the command is given through their press that the undesirable person or persons shall be taken off the air or put out of business. As experienced recently, the said organization then functions as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through their publications the Catholic population are induced to believe that the pope has been insulted by certain broadcasts of speech and, therefore, serious wrong has been done to all Catholics. Further, that it is their solemn duty to cooperate in having the offender put off the air. The Catholic publications write articles concerning the method to be used in ostracizing the undesirable person or corporation, which in some cases has resulted in boycotting by threats and coercion. The usual procedure to accomplish their purpose is, first, for a bishop or priest to demand in behalf of the Catholic people of his community that the radio station owners break their contracts with the so-called ‘offenders’ and exclude them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in the future. When such request is refused, as is often the case, then the station owner is threatened that he may lose some business, and immediately word </span><span class="font5">is given to their different Catholic organizations, such as the Knights of Columbus, to bring pressure on that particular station. The pressure, in substance, is to approach the advertisers who use the facilities of the station involved, with a threat of loss of business by withdrawal of patronage unless they cooperate and join in demanding that the station manager withdraw the undesirable programs. In certain cases where the people and advertisers have refused to do this, their so-called “vigilant committee” has called upon the station owner and intimidated the manager and advertiser. In other cases, such as at Philadelphia, a Catholic cardinal induced the station owner to discontinue broadcasting upon threats to boycott his department-store business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should be most interesting to this committee to know that the common people, Catholics, Hebrews and Protestants, are not protesting against the Watchtower programs and have not engaged in these unethical practices referred to, but that these “vigilant committees”, these editors of Catholic publications and heads of other organizations inciting such lawless methods to accomplish their purposes, are, for the main part, priests, bishops, cardinals and other clergy of the Catholic hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When such station owners realize that their whole business is threatened to be destroyed, they acquiesce to these unfair demands. In addition, such a station owner dare not mention the matter, for fear of further reprisals; but sufficient evidence unmistakably shows that this is their method of operation and that it continues even to the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to their publications, most of these activities are directed, as far as this country is concerned, through the central office in Washington known as the National Catholic Council or Conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic Press article recently showed that Mr. James H. Hanley, one of the Radio Commissioners, a Roman Catholic, was interviewed regarding the manner in which to have Judge Rutherford banned from the air. So far as we are able to determine, the principal reason given by the Catholic hierarchy that Judge Rutherford shall be banned from the air is to the effect that Judge Rutherford mentioned doctrines of purgatory, hell fire torment and trinity and prayers for the dead as being entirely unscriptural. By this we assume that no one dares mention anything which controverts the views of the Catholic hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following are several of many specific instances to substantiate this statement. In addition, I have 169 other Catholic publications showing the same unethical practices, which are here for your information if you desire them for your record.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There were then placed in the record a great number of exeerpts from Catholic newspapers fully establishing every statement above made, and the attention of the Committee was called to articles of similar import appearing in other Catholic newspapers, of which names and dates were given, and the papers themselves were left with the Committee for their further examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other exhibits filed with the Committee for incorporation into the records of the hearing were the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A sheaf of affidavits, with letters attached, In support of the claims of interference and discrimination set forth in the Protest and Petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses were the only proponents of this bill which guarantees free speech over the radio. Several were present to back up their affidavits with oral testimony. C. H. Carr, Albany, N.Y., had the opportunity to so do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only opponents of free speech over the radio, and advocates of the continued discrimination and interference which make the bill a necessity, were and are the following avowed enemies of the people: The National Association of Broadcasters, National Broadcasting Company, Columbia Broadcasting System, National Council of Catholic Men, Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, and the Federal Radio Commission. These do not wish the people to hear what the people themselves wish to hear, and so testified, as the record plainly shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the hearings, the attorney, Mr. Wertz, said to his clients, in substance: “Speaking as an attorney, I may say that we have abundantly, and more than abundantly, established the truth of every statement we have made and every position we have taken in this matter.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">’M WONDERING if the idea of free speech in these United States isn’t losing out a bit. Americans, it seems, are becoming rather touchy on various controversial subjects and the underdogs may be suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radio has to be so careful not to offend anyone. Mr. Cantor or Mr. Wynn springs a fast one on the plumbers or the icemen and immediately the Amalgamated Order of Plumbers or the Association for the Advancement of Icemen registers a great big complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The good old American sense of humor seems to be passing on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And radio stations are tossed off the air because the owner has said something which has offended an organization. Or perhaps the organization holds the opinion the radio speaker is wrong. If the organization is strong enough the radio owner scrams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Chicago interesting movies of rioting in Paris and Vienna are banned because the mayor thinks riots might get going in that great city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newspapers have printed pictures of the riots and stories have followed black headlines. But the movies are barred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That’s censorship and a clamping down on free speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A religious leader speaks his ideas over the radio and the organization he criticizes works to have him barred. And yet the nation was founded on the idea that religion was to be free, that all faiths could be followed and preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Radio stations are closed to him. He can pay and is willing to pay. But stronger organizations clamp down on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Free speech rights are forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radios claim they want no controversial stuff going into the ether. They bar one speaker and permit another one. The address of the one remaining on the air may be controversial and answerable by the man barred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Governmental departments shut down on news. They give out only what they want published. That’s censorship and the free press is no longer free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One radio station with more influence than a weaker one sees to it that the weaker one is pinched. The weaker one may be nipping at the heels of the influential station. Soon the nipping is halted entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president claims there is no thought of censorship in the newspaper code because of the constitution guaranteeing the right of free speech, but newspapers are afraid that in an emergency free speech would go a-glimmering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It’s a changing nation—and the change is for the worst, it seems.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">AYS George Aker (alias Johnny Dab), of Indiana: “Being somewhat an amateur ‘magician’, who obtains his so-called ‘mysteries’ by natural laws only, and having noticed the ‘Study in Nines’, here is one that is a real trick and may be worth your attention. This is supposed to be an effect in mind-reading, a thing which is possible, provided you know in advance what the other person is going to think of. Have someone write down on a slip of paper a row of figures, any number of digits; e.g., 5492873. Then have him add the figures across, which in this case gives 38. Then have him subtract this total from the original number: 5492873 minus 38; which gives an answer of 5492835. Correct? Using this last total, allow him to secretly cross out any one figure he may care to and to give you the remaining figures and you will tell him correctly the figure he crossed out. This is the how. Suppose the figure crossed out is the 4. The number given to you will then be 592835. Write this number down and mentally add the row, which in this case gives 32. And here is where the old </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nine</span><span class="font5"> comes in. Simply subtract this number, 32, from the next higher multiple of nine, which in this case is 36, and your answer is 4, the number crossed out. Simple, isn’t it? And it works every time. In the event that the number is a multiple of nine, then either a nine or a zero has been crossed out. To learn which, merely ask if it was a zero, explaining that a zero has no value; if they reply Yes, you have found the number; if they answer No, you know the nine is the number crossed out.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">AYS Arthur Brenton, of Australia: “There is not a single country where western methods of production are in operation, in which there is any technical productive problem at all, either agricultural or otherwise; and the problem we have to solve is a problem of distribution. Imagine a closed box, representing the industrial system, a box in which are all the plant, material, craftsmanship, and other factors of production. Let there be an outlet from the box through which are to appear those final results of production, which alone justify the undertaking of any production at all—namely, consumable goods, in their widest sense of all the means of life, material and cultural. Let us all stand around this box with slips of paper in our hand bearing the injunction: 'You must consume less, so that the box can produce more? What does this mean? Obviously, that we must allow as little to come out of the box as possible. But observe, the injunction says that this is to enable the box to produce more. More what, then? Surely not consumable goods, for these are of no use inside the box. Quite right. It is not consumable goods, but more 'capital’ goods— more of the above-mentioned factors of production—that are to be produced. In other words, we are to stop up the outlet in order to increase the size of the box. And what then? Well, we go on to the next stage of making use of the increased productive power of the box to draw out of it—a larger supply of consumable goods ? By no means, but to increase still more the size and power of the box. And so ad infinitum. Thus according to the current economic principle do we become ‘prosperous’. It is upon this principle that the financial system bases its policy. It will create and issue money to be used for enlarging the box, but not for buying goods out of the box.”</span></p>

Deeds, 31 years old, told how he “invested” $40 in airplane stock in 1926, and how it was worth more than five million a few years later. Another investor, Fred B. Rentschler, put in $253, and his paper profit in 1929 was $35,575,848. Rentschler received $1,585,514 from the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in six years, during which period the government paid a single subsidiary of that corporation a sum of $40,174,412. The profits made by Deeds represent a net gain of 140,615 percent. Rentschler sold enough stock to net him $9,414,869 and still leave him nearly $8,000,000.

<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>The Delicate Balance of Life</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">(By Waldemar Kaempffert, in the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times) </span><span class="font5">FOR some reason a paragraph or two about ozone in the report that Dr. C. G. Abbott prepares annually of the Smithsonian Institution’s scientific activities received far more prominence last week than it deserved as a piece of news. About us lies an atmosphere in which a little ozone is distributed—so little that if compressed, presumably to the point where it is about to become liquid, it would make a layer but one-eighth of an inch thick. “Were this trifling quantity of atmospheric ozone removed we should all perish,” Dr. Abbott remarked. “If it were ten times greater we could not live. Rickets would prevail universally. Why? Because the layer would cut off the sun’s beneficent ultra-violet rays. It is astonishing and even terrifying to contemplate the narrow margin of safety on which our lives thus depend.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can take nearly every constituent of the atmosphere and reach similar conclusions. Life and water are synonymous. Aridity spells death. Three-fourths of a man is water. Take the aqueous vapor out of the atmosphere as rapidly as it is formed, and the oceans of the earth would dry out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Carbon dioxide, the stuff of which all vegetation is made, is likewise held in the atmosphere. Remove it and there would be no trees and grass, and consequently no higher animal life. The same can be said of the oxygen we breathe and of the nitrogen by which it is diluted, so that we may not be consumed by a process of flameless combustion, and of the comparatively rare gas hydrogen. Life depends not only on an atmosphere, but on a very complex atmosphere of the right chemical composition and physical state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But if we want to have it driven home even more forcibly how delicately balanced is the atmosphere, we have but to turn to the work that Dr. J. Willard Hershey has been doing in McPherson College, Kansas. He proved that such small animals as rats, pigeons, cats, guinea pigs and monkeys die in two to five days when kept in pure oxygen. More startling is his discovery that even the rare gases argon, helium, neon and krypton, comprising less than one percent of the air, are essential to the maintenance of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Hershey tried a mixture of nitrogen (79 percent) and oxygen (21 percent) on his animals. Except for the absence of the rare gases mentioned it was much like the air we breathe. In ten experiments the test animals all died. Other experiments with helium and oxygen proved how important were the exceedingly rare gases. An atmosphere composed of 0.03 percent carbon dioxide (the amount present in air) and 99.7 percent oxygen is fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So, as in air, there are other gases as rare and as important as ozone in the maintenance of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Lewis O'Donnell (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font5">INCE the “greatest debauch the world has ever known, the so-called ‘World War’, when twenty millions were killed, wounded and maimed, the savings of four centuries blown up in powder and smoke” the International Business Machine, of finance, religion and politics, has operated, unchecked, in all civilized nations and in semicivilized and barbarous countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result is that the masses of the people of the civilized countries have lost faith in business men, in newspapers, in public officials, in the agencies that “uplift” the people and that are supposed to guide them in politics, religion and finance, until the people themselves have lost confidence in one another. They trust nobody. They think they have been duped and tricked in their investments. The taxation methods of every country have been proved to be unfair, favoring the few at the expense of the many. Our natural heritage, the resources of the land, have been exploited for the benefit of the few, and our cities have been made the ‘happy hunting ground’ for the public utilities, collecting exorbitant rates for the inside coterie holding their stocks and bonds, and never for the benefit of the cottage owner or tenant and citizens generally. The people believe they are the victims of a world-wide system that leaves them unemployed and without means to make a livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly the practice of usury and extortion, in many forms and guises, preached against by all the Scriptural prophets, forbidden by secular laws of many countries, but that is little mentioned by the newspapers and public men, is responsible for the present world-wide conditions ; breeding revolution in many countries, and the most intense dissatisfaction with their own government that has ever been exhibited by citizens of the United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE following comment in the Mt. Vernon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font5"> is significant: “Once more the perennial battle in Congress to do away with tax-exempt securities is lost. This time the president personally interfered, asking Congress to not consider such legislation because such a move might jeopardize the treasury’s finance program. In short, big financial interests have notified the government that they will not buy government bonds or securities unless they are tax-exempt. Always the threat of refusal to loan looms in the picture; and borrowers, like beggars, cannot choose. Today there are some $22,000,000,000 worth of tax-exempt securities in this country, which do not pay one cent in taxes to maintain government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There you have it. Farmers are turned out of their homes and off their farms because they cannot pay taxes, while the selfish rich threaten to buck the government if it imposes a tax on the billions of hoarded wealth which they hold. The Scriptures make it clear that this consideration for the rich and oppression of the poor is one of the reasons why God will sweep all present institutions and governments into oblivion. Not one of them is worthy of continuance.</span></p>

Yet these fruits and products of labor, welded by so many million hands, are owned by a mere handful of men who probably did no more to produce them than any other equal number of men.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Sydney II. Crane (Indiana)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AVING read of various selfish policies of different corporations as shown toward their employees, I wish to add just one more to that long list. I have been employed at the Ford Assembly Plant at Chicago for six years and five months steadily. The employees who drive to work are obliged to park their cars in a space provided for that purpose. On May 21 last, as we left the plant for home we were greeted at the parking place by part of the office force taking down the make of the car, license number, and badge number. Of course, whoever was lucky enough to be driving a model T or A passed out without any questioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following 28th of May the men who were so unlucky as to be caught with some make of car other than a Ford (with the exception of the bosses) were discharged, and they were given a chance to buy a model A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for me, I was finally given the air after two days’ deliberation, during which time I was trying to reason with them. I explained that I would get rid of my Dodge and buy a model A. I am also paying for a home; and I have a wife and four small children, all of which I have taken unto myself since going to work for Ford. My case was taken to the manager, together with details. So I, the same as hundreds of others, am looking for a chance to sell the only thing I have, that is, my labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This selfish deal is not the first that has occurred. Another one took place when the model T sales declined. Just before that model was abandoned, the order was given to keep all makes of cars out of our parking space except Ford products. This lasted nearly a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the Ford Motor Co., it is abuse upon injury continually. They do not respect even the state law, unless it is in their favor; to wit, they do not pay the men when they run out of material or when machinery breaks down or when some other department is unable to furnish their output in sufficient quantities. They merely knock the men off on their own time, and at the same time keep the doors locked so that the men cannot get out, thereby taking as much as fourteen hours of time paid for as eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have desired for the last three years to write part of this outrage; and when this last order came, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

It is the duty of every bank employee to learn </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font5"> to use the firearms with w'hich he is equipped—not only a duty which he owes his employer, but one which he owes his family and himself as well. A person may carry or possess a firearm for years without knowledge of how to use it, and never have any trouble; but when “old man trouble” does come, that person will either freeze in his tracks and be shot down, draw his firearm and shoot some innocent bystander, or scatter his shots all over creation and never hit “Mister Bandit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The old phrase, “You can’t tell what you will do in a pinch,” is incorrect. One man who is thoroughly familiar with firearms is equal to four or five who are not. The trained man </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">knows</span><span class="font5"> that as the average man uses a gun it is rarely effective even at point-blank range, for the simple reason that if the gun is pointed directly at another’s chest at a distance of 10 feet, and the muzzle wavered | an inch when the trigger is pulled, there will be a miss—and a miss in an emergency means cither a harp or a shovel. Contrary to popular belief, few gunmen can shoot straight, due to the sudden yank they give when pulling the trigger. It is a well-known fact that fully 90 percent of the people shot by bandits have powder burns on their bodies, which indicates that the gun was held practically against the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The firearms usually carried by bandits are not of the best. Many are of cheap foreign make that have been smuggled into this country. Due to the fact that permits for firearms are so difficult to obtain, the crooks get what they can. Their firearms are neither well made nor well balanced. This, no doubt, accounts for the poor marksmanship of the average criminal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE Rev. Dr. John Wesley Hill, chancellor of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lincoln Memorial University, Cumberland Gap, Tenn., in a speech at the Kiwanis Club, St. Louis, Mo., is alleged to have said: “And if I had my way, that government would load all radicals advocating such changes on a ship of stone, with sails of lead and the wrath of God as a gale, and with Hell as its nearest port.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is too bad that these would-be clerical murderers cannot even be original. If we recall correctly, these are the words that were used by Rev. Hillis, of Brooklyn, some time in the manufactured red scare in the fall of 1919. Readers who care to take the time will find the identical words in a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> some twelve years back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At that time Mitchell Palmer had hopes of riding into the presidential chair on the wave of a red scare which existed only in his own head. He used the government to help put it across, but even with government backing the scare was a rank failure and was finally given up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government loaded up a ship with people it did not like, anti that were not liked by some of our prominent 100%-profit Americans of the time, and timidly steered it across the ocean to Russia. Rev. Hillis, out of the greatness of his soul, composed the blessing outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Rev. Dr. John Wesley Hill seeks to convince us that he is a great man because of the strength of his similes and metaphors, we are unconvinced; but if he wishes us to think that he and Hillis are as alike as two not very goodlooking horses’ tails, then we have all the evidence we need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">right on in, Mr.------; sit right down here and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">let me tell you the whole story. My husband died five days ago, which was on Tuesday morning, and the reason I haven’t sent for you before is that my husband was a Christian Scientist, as well as all of us, and our friends have been coming here every night, telling us not to bury him, that they were going to raise him from the dead. In the meantime the body began to smell, and the good lady next door told the chief of police. And that is why the chief of police sent for you.’ The pool’ woman was in great distress as the scene went on, more so than any other person he ever knew, so the undertaker informed me. Surely the missionaries should come home, and begin here right at their doors, and among themselves as well as among the other people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE Reverend Thomas H. Whelpley, pastor of the Chelsea Presbyterian church, New</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">York city, was formerly from Nova Scotia. The Canadian papers are taking note of the fact that he recently said in New York that the Old Testament is filled with difficulties and even absurdities and that he is convinced it is the source of most of our spiritual disasters; also that even the hero stories have a tendency to make heathens of our children. When Jesus asked the question, “Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures?” (Mark 12:24) He meant the “Old Testament” scriptures, which Reverend Whelpley despises; but then it should be remembered that Jesus was a true and humble child of God, and Whelpley is a clergyman.</span></p>

The fall in the value of the dollar has involved it in a loss of about $100,000, affecting the activities of its missions in heathen countries to that extent. If the Presbyterians are still bringing the heathen the bad news of great misery that the majority of the human race, including all their ancestors, are predestined to spend infinite years in conscious torment, then this setback of the missionary activities is that much of a blessing to the heathen. We presume Presbyterians still cleave to this “doctrine of devils”, as they have never officially repudiated it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford has stated more than once that the teaching of the churches has turned many people away from God. Here is a letter </span><span class="font5">from one who was offended by the preachments of religious leaders and who now has found the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am penning you a few lines to express my opinion and sentiments on your writings. They are the only common-sense books I ever read. In my opinion you fear nothing but God your Maker, and He takes care of you. If not, they would bump you off. As for me, I never belonged to anything. My people were mostly what they called “Free Baptists”. Now, I never could see anything free but the air we breathe. As to the clergy of any kind, I never had any use for them. I could see there was something wrong, and because I never would go and listen to these hypocrites I was considered a bad boy. Those old church grannies said I would be hung before I was 30. I will be 68 in coming May, and I have lived a rough-and-tumble life. To tell the truth, I did not care much nor think about God, man or devil. I just looked on religion as a fraud and the systejn of the way things are run as just a graft, and the preachers as the worst of all. A friend lent me some of your books. Well, I said, here is the only thing that ever looked right. So I sent and got all your books up to that time, and a Bible. But what gets me is some of my relations back east, who have always read the Bible and belong to any church and listen to a preacher of any kind. The Bible tells what they always were and are: blind leading the blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I admire your courage, and God grant you more power to enlighten the people. As for me. I lose my patience with most people. They don’t want truth; nothing but nonsense. . . . But the God whom you serve will look after your safety as He did Daniel in the lions’ den, and He will not let the wolves destroy you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With sincerity, I am</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>New Ways to Get Money</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE United Church of Canada has found two new ways to get money, or at least to ask for it, and it is no mean achievement, in these days, after all that has been done in that line, for a church to be able to think of a new way to ask for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United Church of Canada is a union of Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational churches. It maintains all the usual departments of home and foreign missions, education and pensions, and now announces an annuity plan whereby, in consideration of a gift of suitable proportions, it will return the giver an income from the amount, on condition that at his death the gift becomes the property of the church. Looks like a good scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who, having a pile of ducats which he knows not how to invest safely (and what investment is safe in these days?), and who fears the climatic conditions in the world to come will be not all that could be desired, would not willingly turn over his roll to a bunch of dominies who need it, thereby assuring himself of plenty for the life that now is, and an eternal interest in a frigidaire in the life that is-to come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The other scheme is not so pretentious, and yet it may bring in more coin of the realm. It does not go after the whole pile, but merely after the loose change. The idea is that every member of the family, when he gets a spare nickel, shall put it in a little pasteboard bank, to be turned over to the dominie once in so often. The cost of the pasteboard banks is 60c a dozen, but the gracious provision is made that the cost may be deducted from the contents of the boxes when opened. In other words, by the second scheme you also get some of your money back. Clever idea. An idea still more clever is not to give them any of it at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ev. H. McAllister Griffiths, editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity Today,</span><span class="font5"> in a sermon in Philadelphia, in February, urged 1,300 Modernist ministers of the Presbyterian church to quit the ministry. He affirmed that the only peace the Presbyterian church now has with these preachers in their midst is “the peace of a church that is dying without a struggle”, and that “if the process should continue unchecked, fifteen years more will see historic Presbyterianism regarded as a quaint relic in the then so-called 'Presbyterian Church’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We comfort Mr. Griffiths by expressing our conviction that in fifteen years from now every variety of Presbyterianism and all the other isms will have completely ceased. God’s kingdom is at hand; it is functioning in the earth; the old world is passing away, and groaning as it passes. And everybody, including Mr. Griffiths, will be glad when it is gone. Nobody will ■want to preserve any of the quaint relics of the past. Indeed, the prophet says that “they shall not be remembered nor come into mind”.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>Wakulla Spring, Georgia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By 8.</span><span class="font4"> IV. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Williams (Alabama)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5"> WISH all your readers could see Wakulla spring, this mammoth work of God, for no pen picture can fully portray its grandeur and beauty. Your scribe recently made a visit to this marvel of nature which bubbles up not far from the south Georgia line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One pays 25c and rides out in a glass-bottomed boat over crystal-clear waters gushing up from 186 feet below. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> says one can see a penny lying on the bottom; let me tell you, as an eye witness, that objects of less size may be seen at the full depth. The water is so clear that it does not appear to be over 50 feet deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the attractions of Wakulla spring is the schools of flying fish. The fish seem to be about the size of a man’s arm. They can jump about six feet clear of the water and go back into it several yards from their starting point, and they do this constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many kinds of fish in the big spring. They travel in schools, every kind in its own school. The various schools were not friendly, mingling together as we would have expected them to do. They seemed to be as selfish as the religious denominations of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I wish you could all have been down with me in the deep, tangled wildwood of Florida, where a full-grown river is made by this single spring. It is a regular picnic to watch the flying fish play leapfrog.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>The Fountain of Youth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By E. J. Bullock (Florida)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5"> BELIEVE that pure water is a great factor in building up and preserving the health. In these days of trainloads of soft drinks, teas and coffees, and hooch, the good old God-given spring on the hillside, bubbling up through the rocks and purified through nature’s process, has been sadly neglected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have free stone springs, lithia, iron, sulphur and other mineral springs furnishing us with drink that is far better than any beverage brought forth by mere man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I recall that several years ago I was much under weight and received a sample of medicine, along with which were the following instructions : “Banish care as you would a serpent, and drink lots of water.” I did so and gained twelve pounds in two weeks. I often wonder if ‘banishing care and drinking lots of water’ hadn’t more to do with the gain in weight than the sample of medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When arising in the morning is the time we least care to drink water; and that is the time we need it most—the interior bath—and if we drink two full glasses of water on arising we do not so much feel the need of other beverage. Many people go days without a glass of water because, through habit, their requirements for drink are supplied through tea, coffee, etc. We can develop a water habit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There’s frost in the meadow; There’s song in the air, For the birds are holding</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A jubilee there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There's a song in the valley, And if you will look,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The songster, you'll find, Is the babbling brook.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">It has babbled along For ages untold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Its wealth is far greater Than silver or gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Its source is just yonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God taught it to sing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let’s take the old bucket And go to the spring.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>In Case Chris Should Slip</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">O ALL who dig up $1 or more, the Salvato-rian Seminary, Society of the Divine Savior, Saint Nazianz, Manitowoc county, Wisconsin, P. 0. Box B, offers a choice of four medals, one of which we notice is called the St. Christopher Medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It says about this Christopher medal: “St. Christopher is the acknowledged and special patron of travelers. He is invoked against accidents, storms and sudden death, and in this day of automobiles such protection is all the more necessary. The pious wearing of this medal is a constant invocation, as it were, for his protection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now doesn’t that look like a good accident policy? It surely does. One side of the medal shows “St. Christopher” being steered around by a baby Jesus, seemingly astride his neck. So far, so good. But we turn the medal over, and on its back it says, “I am a Catholic. In case of an accident kindly notify a priest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is wrong with that? Nothing, only—. Only what? Only that this method of insuring against accident, with provisions of what to do in case the policy doesn’t work, makes us think of the church member who knew he was going to die. He asked that they put in his coffin his nicely framed certificate of church membership and along with it the chemical fire-extinguisher that up till that time had always hung in the front hall. He didn’t intend to take any chances. And, on the whole, you can’t blame him. Send in your dollar and get a medal.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>“Catholic Association Urges World Parliament”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HAT is the title of an article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font5"> covering almost a full page of its issue of March 17, 1934. The opening sentence is: “Something like a parliament of nations and a federation of the world is proposed by the Catholic Association for International Peace.” The conclusion is: “Put it all together, and if spells brotherhood of man, an economic federation in which nations, employer and employee, capital and labor, producer and consumer, would have representation. St. Peter’s is the basilica of a faith common to all countries. Perhaps the nations may erect a basilica for a common economic and social creed that will bring them a little nearer to the Kingdom of God on earth.” This proposition for a Catholic League of Nations is well timed. It is announced just at the close of the pope’s “Holy Year”. An intervening paragraph says: “The study, which is to be published in several languages, is the joint work of the Ethics and the Economic Relations Committees of the Association, and was under the immediate preparation of the Rt. Rev. John A. Ryan, of the Catholic University of America; Prof. Parker T. Moon, of Columbia University and the Rev. R. A. McGowan, assistant director of the Social Action Department, National Catholic Welfare Conference.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last named institution, maintained by the bishops of the Roman hierarchy, is the clearing house through which the efforts were made last year (and are still being made) to force Judge Rutherford off the air. As soon as a station has been coerced into breaking a contract, the N.C.W.C. fixes up a news dispatch so framed as to make it appear that it was a voluntary act, and sends it out over all the country to induce and intimidate other stations into doing the same thing.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Mass Out of Focus at Ten Meters</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE Cleveland Polish Daily </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Wiadomosci</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Codzienne</span><span class="font5"> of November 18 contains the interesting information that the mass read in the Catholic church is valuable outside of the church only over a distance of ten meters, and that is why it is no good over the radio. It seems, in an item bristling with no less than 45 z’s, 34 s’s and 31 w’s, that the “Holy Office” has discovered that somebody is holding out on them since it became possible to get something worth while over the radio. And so the 'Holy Office” has figured it out that if a church is not crowded the mass is good merely within the walls, but if it is overcrowded it is good for 10 meters outside, and that is positively all. We looked it up; a meter is 39.37 inches, and so 10 meters come to 393.7 inches, or 32 feet 9.7 inches. In practice it works out this way: If your feet are within 32 feet 9.7 inches of the wall of the church, then you are in focus, provided there is a big crowd, and provided you keep on your feet. If you keep your feet in the same place you are out of luck if you sit down unless you turn your back to the church. If you face the other way, your feet are in the mass, but your brains and the rest of you, except your shins and knees, are out of it. A little study makes it all clear.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>&quot;For the Love of the Divine Infant?’</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE in hand a circular letter, an appeal from St. Christopher’s Inn, Garrison, N. Y. The inn is under the care of Fr. Anselm Francis, S.A., “spiritual director.” Meals given out in 1925 were 49,969; meals given out in 1930 were 118,130. Night lodgings in 1925 were 16,636; night lodgings in 1930 were 39,399. The report shows the increasing strain being put on every part of the machine. Men’s hearts are failing them for fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fr. Anselm says: “I beg of you for the love of the Divine Infant to send us an offering,” and terminates his letter with “Asking the Divine Babe to love you”. The letterhead shows a great throng of the hungry unemployed. In a corner, with the hay all about him, is a ‘Baby Jesus’ in a one-piece Rubens suit. Apparently he is about a year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Learys sent this to us. They say, “Please tell me, why doesn’t this babe ever grow up? Will you kindly ask them? I haven’t the heart to.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Well, we are “leary”, too, but willing to do anything to be accommodating. That Jesus was a baby once, we admit; the Scriptures show that He grew to be a man, and is now the express image of the Father’s person, the Lord of life and glory, with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wait till He takes this unemployment proposition in hand, and there will be something doing. Meantime, we are glad for all the good anybody is doing in lending a helping hand to the poor and needy.</span></p>

When I came into the yard and up to where he was I noticed that he had some bones and meat out on the walk in an old dishpan. As he owns a dog, I thought that it was dog-meat that he had in the pan, washing it off. In the course of our conversation he advised me that he did not have a cent to his name and had been destitute over a year and that all he had to eat was the scrap meat and bones from a butcher shop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I met another ex-minister the other day who also was &quot;having visions and talking with God’ and giving out typewritten folders of his demoninspired doctrines and predictions. He was also destitute and dirty and in filthy garb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Surely Jehovah is now allowing us to see these false prophets in destitute circumstances, hungry and almost naked, and in darkness, while His own, true to His promise, have food convenient for mind and body.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“It was the member who was elected in this town forty years ago who proposed the first resolution in a gathering of the principal Allied statesmen in Paris in 1919 upon which the Covenant of the League of Nations was afterwards based. The cabinet of which. I was the head was the only government in the world that had, before the conference met, and even before the Armistice was signed, prepared carefully thought-out plans for putting the principle of that resolution into operation. Even during the most anxious moments of the war there were committees of that cabinet sitting to frame a scheme for setting up an association of nations for ensuring peace on earth.”</span></p>

It is reported that fishermen have seen at least twenty-five feet of its body, and that its head, shaped somewhat like that of a horse, is as big as a beer keg. Of course, it got away. Making due allowance for the tendency to exaggerate with which fishermen are said to be endowed, we still think the monster must be something out of the ordinary. Remains of such creatures have been assigned an age of several million years by scientists. The fact that some of these inhabitants of a departed world are still in existence would seem to show that scientists share the weakness which is said to be a characteristic limited to fishermen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">She went as she would have wished to go, arrested on a false charge, ‘&quot;guilty” only of obeying the Lord’s command, and following His example of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom from door to door, in Millvale, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brought before Burgess Pfischner, with 52 others of Jehovah’s witnesses, she, in common with the others, was discharged, not having committed any offense.

<h3><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses ‘Standing for Their Lives’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">(A personal letter from Pittsburgh to a New York correspondent)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear A---,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thought perhaps you would be interested in our last Saturday’s experience with the transcription machines [employed to reproduce Judge Rutherford’s Bible discourses in lecture halls—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.],</span><span class="font5"> as it was amusing to see how hard the Devil is trying to stop the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In giving out the fliers announcing the last meeting of the series in Millvale on “Can the World Be Recovered?” one sister was stopped, just as she had about finished, by the chief of police of that town and told that there was no need for her to give out any more fliers, as there was not going to be a meeting, that he was going to stop it, and he wanted her to tell those in charge to come and see him about it, as he understood at the last meeting we insulted two of their priests. The chief of police is also Catholic. Of course, no attention was paid to his remarks or his request, but everything was arranged for the meeting as usual, the meeting being scheduled for Saturday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saturday afternoon, about one o’clock, the man who rented the hall to Stewart called him and asked him not to have the meeting, as he heard there was going to be trouble. Stewart came over to the auditorium, and we decided to call the owner and see what he meant by ‘trouble’; and he again begged Stewart not to have the meeting, and tried every excuse possible, saying that the meeting was misrepresented, etc., and finally said that the Catholics were going to send 500 or 600 around to cause a riot. Not getting anywhere over the phone, he asked us to come out when he would be at home (he being the bank cashier of the town) and he could talk further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of his telling us that they were going to cause a riot, and of what the chief of police said, we thought it might be well to have the state police on hand; so Pyle, Stewart and I started out to find the state police. But they said that they could not help us at this time, and suggested seeing the sheriff for help. On the way back we decided to tell the Millvale chief that we expected this protection; but he said that he would not do this, and that he was going to stop the meeting himself. So we left for the sheriff’s office, and, it being late, found that he was gone for the day. Knowing his brother very well, I called him, and he told me that the sheriff was out of town and would not be back until Monday, but told me whom to get in touch with, a deputy, and I finally found the proper deputy, who said that if there was going to be trouble he would send a machine-load of deputies around, at 7:30 p.m. In the meantime we had a large number of the friends on the phone and advised them to be around at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We later went to see the owner of the building, and he again stated the facts, stating that 62 percent of the people of that town were Catholics and they had asked him to stop the meeting. Being the cashier of the bank, he was afraid that if we went ahead with the meeting he would lose his job. When told that we were going ahead with the meeting, he showed us the door and told us to get out, and, as we were leaving, told us to “go to------”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Well, we went back and waited for 7: 30, when the deputies would arrive. Some of the friends arrived about 7:15 and found two Millvale policemen at the door, who would not let them in, saying that the meeting was off. We already had the transcription machine and record in the building and were all set for the meeting. By 7: 30 a fairly large crowd had gathered out in front of the building, and promptly on time the deputies arrived. They inquired what the trouble was, and were informed by the Millvale police that they were instructed by the chief to close the place. However, the deputies insisted on their opening the doors and letting the people in, which they did. The chief soon came around and wanted to know how the people got in, and the police pointed to the sheriff’s car with seven deputies; and the chief </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font5">ediately changed his ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The building holds about 100 to 125 seats, and, in the six meetings preceding, the largest attendance, including friends, was about 40, with 15 or 20 strangers. This evening we had about 50 of the friends there, a few strangers came in, and about ten minutes to eight a body of men and boys marched down from the Irish Catholic church, where they had a meeting, with instructions what to do. There were about 50 in this group, and in about five minutes more over 150 more marched down from the German Catholic church just around the corner. This more than filled the hall, with all standing room taken and the two anterooms filled, and then others kept coming until the crowd filled all the way down the steps. The deputies did not attempt to give</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">any instructions; were just waiting for any trouble that might be started; and the chief sent his two men up into the hall to see that there was no trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everything went O.K. for the first few minutes, and when Judge Rutherford first mentioned that the Catholic church was of the Devil, some one of the crowd started to give a soft laugh, and this laugh passed from one to the other for a few seconds and then stopped. When the same subject was mentioned again the same thing started, and then Jehovah used one of their own crowd to help the meeting on, as it would have been useless for any of our crowd to say anything, with the determination and instructions they had to break up the meeting. The leader of one of the crowds rose to his feet at this point and asked all to be gentlemen and hear what was said before they judged, and all obeyed and were very quiet throughout the rest of the lecture. Just at the time when this second laugh and speech by their leader was on, one of the brethren running the transcription machine got his foot mixed up with the electric cord and it was pulled out of the socket. While this small interruption was on the lecture was off, but when the lecture started the people were all quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The net result was that, instead of 15 or 20 listening to the lecture, close to 300 listened very closely, standing on every foot of space, and hearing just what the priest did not want them to hear. After the meeting was over, the leader of one of the crowds started to argue with the chairman of the meeting, and became loud at times, which brought some of the men back; and, seeing that he had an audience, he became louder in his talk and denied what was said by Judge Rutherford, and he was soon assisted by another leader; but before he could say much the Millvale police insisted on their clearing out of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In talking with many of the Catholics gathered around the building and not being able to get in, and also with the chief of police himself, they stated that the whole thing had been greatly misrepresented, and that from what they could see we were being greatly discriminated against and they did not believe the lies that were told. Several Catholics who could not hear asked if we could not bring the lecture to their home sometime, so that they could listen to this lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout it all we can see the leading of Jehovah with His people, and can see the desperate fight the Devil is putting forth, although he sure is leading a losing battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just recently one of our newly interested Catholic boys, 22 years of age, was beaten with a whip by his mother and thrown out of his house because he insisted on going out in the witness work. This boy is very active in the work, even with the great handicap of being almost blind. At his work he talks with everyone, having three other Catholic boys going out in the witness work with him, and now has a Jew interested who has started out in the witness work the last two Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was written with interruptions. Thought when I started this that I would have time to write it, but soon found that there were many other things to do. Thought, however, that you would be interested in the Devil’s attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in Jehovah’s service, _____ <sup>w</sup>-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Racketeering in Its Most Despicable Form</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font5">NE of the elementary principles of Christianity is sympathy for those that are in sorrow over the loss of their loved ones. The reason why Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus was that He sympathized with Mary and Martha and with all who were passing through like afflictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The heavenly Father has the same sympathetic heart. “In all their affliction he was afflicted” is a statement that touches every human heart. His Word counsels to “weep with them that weep” and to “comfort all that mourn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this little introduction we present to the attention of our readers an illustration of the most devilish, callous heartlessness of which the mind can conceive. It is from a personal letter to Judge Rutherford. Plumb, if you can, the depths of meanness and cruelty of the diabolical system responsible, and ponder that it is this same system that demands that Judge Rutherford be put off the air so that matters of this kind may become everyday affairs in this country and nobody may dare to say a word in protest. Indeed, they are everyday matters </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font5"> Here is the letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am a reader of all your writings and believe in your explanation of the Bible and its truths, so with that in mind here is one truth I want you to have. No doubt you will be able to use it to good advantage in telling the people of the injustice in the Catholic church, Erie, Pa. I refer to St. Stanislau Church, corner 13th and Wallace streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I had a sister die on January 29, 1934, and, as you know, it is customary to go to the priest and arrange for mass on the day of burial. The wish of the family was to have the funeral on Friday, February 2, but the parish priest said No, that it had to be on Thursday, February 1, but before he would have the funeral, or even give a date, they w’ould have to pay for the pew rent and a building fund, and $35 to $65 for mass, and it would all have to be paid in advance—which the poor family could not pay, as they were hit with the hard times like many others. The total he had charged against them was around $200, to cover all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The family would not agree to pay it, and so the funeral was not held in any church, as no priest will buck another priest. They talk about shotgun men, but this method of robbing the dead and the sorrowing ones that remain behind makes the man with the gun a king compared to the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The history of our family in that church is that my father belonged 4S years and was fully paid up. The sister that died belonged since she was married, for over 28 years, and was fully paid in pew rent for all except two years, and then they paid each Sunday, as they charged 10c a pew. The last building charge they did not pay, for they did not pledge themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After they turned her husband and children, down, my father, fully paid up, went to see what he could do, and the priest that caused all the trouble, Ignasiak, closed the door in his face and would not give him a civil answer; so they held the funeral at the home on Friday, the 2d, and not in the church. The woman who died was Rose Koprowski, 714 East 12th street; the family is well known in Erie. The reason I did not write you sooner is that I wanted to get all the facts. I was not able to attend the funeral myself, on account of sickness in my own home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My interest in writing this letter is not for what happened to our family, but for the good that might come to others that are in the same circumstances. With best wishes, and may you keep up the good work, I subscribe myself</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your true friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An item that was brought up again and again at the hearings on the McFadden bill at Washington is that Jehovah’s witnesses give offense to those of other faiths. Suppose they do; Jesus himself gave offense. His strictures against the religionists of His day, recorded in Matthew 23:1-33, are incapable of being expressed without giving offense to those that are in the wrong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Y</span><span class="font5">OU hear of books having a “tremendous” distribution of 100,000, or 200,000, or even a half million, but rarely do you hear of books having edition numbers as high as those of Judge Rutherford’s. There are listed below Judge Rutherford’s 14 elothbound books. In a short space of time these books have reached an unprecedented distribution. The quantities mentioned are those printed in the United States alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some religionists, Catholic and Protestant, claim that the people do not want to hear Judge Rutherford. The great commercial broadcasting companies make a like claim. As this issue of THE GOLDEN AGE points out, powerful interests, commercial, religious and political, have set themselves against the Kingdom message and have decided that the American people should not want to hear this message. Of persons with sane reasoning we ask, What did the two and one-half million signers of the Protest and Petition presented to Congress desire ? What do the hundreds of thousands of people who have written to their congressmen in regard to the McFadden Bill desire ? What do the tens of millions of readers of Judge Rutherford’s books desire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Passing strange, and very improbable, that Judge Rutherford’s books and booklets could reach a circulation of over a hundred and fifty million copies if the peoples of the earth did not desire to know what he has to say. It is the truth he speaks; and the clergy know it. As Judge Rutherford has so clearly pointed out, the clergy and their organizations, as well as the political and commercial elements of the earth, are a part of the Devil’s organization which is in opposition and opposing the establishment of God’s kingdom. This wicked combine Judge Rutherford points out will be destroyed at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everyone should be informed fully on a matter so vital as this. Obtain the complete set of Judge Rutherford’s clothbound books, each 350 or more pages, beautifully illustrated, embossed, and all stamped in gold. Makes a beautiful library, each book bound in cloth of different color; an array of color such as displayed only in the rainbow. Read these and be fully informed as to Jehovah’s purposes concerning the blessing and the regeneration of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can you imagine! All 14 of these books can be had for the small sum of $3.50! By making this contribution for these books you will aid in the publication of more, so that those who have not already read but are seeking after life may, too, have an opportunity to learn.</span></p>

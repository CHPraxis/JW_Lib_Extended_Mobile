<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS COVENANTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART G</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And you arc they who have continued with me in my trials. And 1 covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a Kingdom.”—Luke 22:28,29, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH covenanted unto his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, a kingdom, which kingdom is the capital organization of Jehovah and of which, of course, Christ Jesus is the Head and Lord. In God's due time that kingdom, which is “the holy city” or heavenly organization, completely dedicated and devoted to Jehovah God, comes down from God out of heaven and takes charge of the affairs of the world. Jehovah authorizes Christ Jesus to covenant unto his faithful brethren for a part or place in that kingdom, that such faithful ones might be a part of his royal organization. It is the kingdom or holy organization that comp lately vindicates Jehovah’s name after first bearing testimony to his name. That covenant for the kingdom is separate and distinct from the new covenant, but is closely related thereto. One must be in the new covenant before he can be in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FORESHADOWED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ King David was a type foreshadowing the King, Christ Jesus. Being a Jew, David was subject to the law covenant made in Egypt; but it was after he was thirty-seven years old that God made with David a covenant to establish his kingdom for ever. (2 Sam. 7: 1-29) Jesus Christ made announcement of the covenant. for the kingdom for the first time after he told his disciples of and concerning the making of the new covenant. At the same time of the making the announcement to them that God had covenanted with him for a kingdom, Jesus stated to his faithful disciples that he covenanted unto his faithful brethren that they should participate with him in that kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Forty years after the law covenant was made in Egypt and inaugurated at Mount Sinai God commanded Moses to make a covenant with Israel in the land of Moab. “These arc the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.” (Deut. 29:1) That covenant made in the land of Moab foreshadowed the covenant for the kingdom. The Moab covenant was a means or measure instituted to prepare the Israelites to enter into Canaan and to serve God there. It also pictured the purpose of Jehovah to do a preparatory work with his people on earth since 1918. Shortly before the making of the covenant at Moab Jehovah commanded Moses to prepare the Israelites eligible for war service. (Num. 2(5:1-4) At the same place was the camp of the Israelites when Balak, the king of Moab, hired Balaam to curse the Israelites. (Num. 22:1-24:25) From there the Israelites set out to execute Jehovah’s judgment against the Midianites for vexing God’s people. (Num. 25:15-18; 31:1-12) Natural Israel was at that time in Moab, in a land not assigned for its inheritance. Likewise the people of God taken out for his name, that is, spiritual Israelites, are in the world but not part of it at the time they are taken into the covenant, for the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The time and circumstances surrounding the making of the eovenant in Moab foreshadowed the time and circumstances surrounding the men of spiritual Israel when taken into the covenant for Ihe kingdom. This covenant also was looking to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Deut. 1:3; Num. 10:10) At the time of making of the covenant in Moab Jehovah had begun his rule amidst his enemies and was thus using his typical people. He was then “King in Jeshurun”, when these tribes of Israel were gathered together in the land of Moab. (Deut. 33:5) The lands east of the Jordan had then been brought under control by the defeat of the Amorites under their ruler Sihon and by the slaying of Og king of Eashan. (Deut. 2:24-27; 3:1-11; 4:47; 29:7,8; 31:4) The land of these enemies of Israel had then been possessed by the cattle-raising tribes of Israel. (Deut. 3:13-20; Josh. 1:12-1S) These surrounding conditions well find a parallel in what came to pass from 1914 to 1918 in this, that Christ Jesus was sent forth in 1914 to rule amidst his enemies, and he then made war against Satan and his angels and cast them out of heaven. (Ps. 110:2; Rev. 12:7-9) This corresponding condition is a strong argument that the remnant were taken into the covenant for the kingdom after 1918 and alter the birth of the kingdom, and after Christ Jesus appeared to build up Zion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO TAKEN IN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> At the time of making the covenant in Moab Aaron was dead and there was none of the original company living who had left Egypt and who were past sixty years of age aside from Eleazar the high priest, Joshua and Caleb, the last at that time being seventy-nine years of age. (Dcut. 1:36-39; Ex. 6:23; Josh. 14:6-11) It follows then that most of those taken into the covenant in Moab were “young men’’, such as mentioned in a later prophecy. (Joel 2: 28) “Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers’ house, all that arc able to go to war in Israel. Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the Lord commanded Moses, and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt. These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance, according to the number of names.” (Num. 26:2,4,51-53) Although Caleb was then seventy-nine years of age he was counted as a young man of forty years, and this manifestly because of his faithfulness to God. (Josh. 14:6-11) Caleb was a good representative there of that class of faithful ones who were also foreshadowed by Mordecai and Naomi, at the time of the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment. The zeal of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the high priest, makes him a good picture of the. “young men” mentioned by the prophet Joel.—Num. 25:6-13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“The older generation of the Israelites who had been rebellious, coinplaincrs, filled with fear to perform their duties and wanting to return to Egypt rather than give battle to the enemy, had been completely cleared out, and none of them went into Canaan. “These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho. But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb, the son of Jcphunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.”—Num. 26:63-65.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> At the time Jesus announced the kingdom covenant to his faithful disciples Judas, who foreshadowed the rebellious coinplaincrs and fearful ones, had been ordered out and was then away. (Luke 22:28-30; John 13:21-30) At the temple the “old men” who are complainers, faultfinders, selfish ones and opposers, are not taken into the kingdom, but such are debarred from entering by the gates of the city. Since October 15, 1932, the sanctuary has been cleansed. (Dan. 8:14; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> July 15, 1933) When the Israelites left Sinai they were in line for the promised land, but only a few entered. During the Elijah work and up to the time of the coming of the Lord to the temple many spiritual Israelites were in line for the kingdom, but those who committed the “sin of Samaria”, who arc complainers and faultfinders and opposers, and who arc fearful of boldly proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom against the enemy are left out. Those taken into the covenant for the kingdom must have proved their faithfulness up to that point of lime.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME OF JUDGMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple marks the time of his judgment. Before that time judgment must wait, because justice was one of Jehovah's 'sealed treasures’. At the making of the covenant in Moab the iniquity of the Amorites was full and the time for the execution of judgment upon them had come. (Gen. 15:16) So likewise when the Lord Jesus appeared at the temple for judgment the iniquity of “Christendom” was full, but first the judgment must begin at the house of God. (1 Bet. 4:17) Jehovah’s order of judgment stems’ to be clearly foreshadowed bj' the following: “And he said, The Lord came from [first] Sinai, and rose up from [second] Soir unto them; he shined forth from [third] mount. Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.” (Deut. 33: 2) Here Sinai, mentioned first, well pictures God's sanctuary. “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.” (Ps. 68:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Scir, mentioned as second, pictures the “evil servant” class, the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” Mount Paran seems well to picture the “elective elder” class once in line for the kingdom, for it was at the wilderness of Paran that Jehovah cleared out the unfaithful elders. (Num. 12:16; 13:26-33; 14:1-39) Compare this with the words of Jude: “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.”—Jude 14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> At Moab Jehovah told Moses that among those with whom the covenant was being made there were many who were rot sincere and truly devoted to him. (Deut. 31:16-29) Likewise even after the taking of those into the temple and into the kingdom covenant there existed a need of cleansing and clearing out of the insincere ones, including those who had selfishly sought and accepted the position of elective elders, and who insisted upon walking after their own selfish desires, and hence were not entirely devoted to God and to his kingdom. There must be no murmurers, complainers, op posers or selfish, rebellious ones who abide in the covenant for the kingdom. Those at the cleansed temple are at unity in Christ. It is the time of peace within the walls of that glorious palace, and all of this house must seek the good of all others therein. (Ps. 122: 7-9) Those in the covenant for the kingdom, and who are the ones taken out as a people for God’s name, must walk on, shoulder to shoulder, looking well to the interests of the kingdom, and continue singing the praises of Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SONG</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Song.is evidence of joy. It was therefore appropriate, when Moses, as God’s instrument, announced to the Israelites in Moab the terms of the covenant there made, that he should compose and sing a song; which he did. The Israelites were about to engage in war and enter into the land of promise. That song sung upon the plains of Moab foretold a far more wonderful song to l&gt;e sung at the induction of God’s chosen people into the covenant for the kingdom. That more wonderful song is now being sung. The words of the song of Moses proceeded from Jehovah God, and Moses, acting as the mouthpiece of Jehovah, spoke the words of this song, to wit: “Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth: My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon the herb.” (Dcut. 32:1, 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The song emphasized the great truth thereof, to wit, that the chief purpose of the covenant is the vindication of Jehovah’s name; that Jehovah’s name must be known and exalted in all the universe. Calling upon all spiritually-minded ones to give ear, the song ascribes all goodness and loving-kindness to Jehovah, and then says: “For I will proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe ye greatness unto our God. The Hock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.” (Deut. 32:3,4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The song then tells in brief concerning the judgment of Jehovah and informs his covenant people how they have violated their covenant. “They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; they are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the Lord, 0 foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy f&lt;rihW Aaxib bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee.” (Deut. 32: 5,6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Speaking of his justice and judgment Jehovah reminds his people that vengeance (that is, vindication of his name) belongs to him. “Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot shall slide: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. For Jehovah will judge his people.” (Deut. 32:35, 36, A.R.V.) The prophetic song then shows that Jehovah will execute this judgment by his glittering “sword”, that is, by him whom he has appointed as the Judge of all things and the Vindicator of his great and holy name: “If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, and will recompense them that hate me.”—Dcut,. 32:41. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> This song of Moses corresponds exactly and runs parallel with ‘the song of Moses and the Lamb’, sung when Zion is builded up and when the remnant are taken into the covenant for the kingdom. The picture is that of the entire 144,000, which includes the remnant on earth, standing by the “sea of glass”, symbolic of the judgments of Jehovah, which judgments </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">now clearly made known to the remnant, as it is wtiten: “Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O Lord, thou preservest man and beast. How excellent is thy lovingkindncss, 0 God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.”— Ps. 36:6,7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” The song on the plains of Moab now finds a greater fulitlmcnt in the words of the Greater Moses, to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">wit: ‘&quot;And </span><span class="font3">they sing the song of Moses the servant of God. and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, 0 Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">manifest.” </span><span class="font3">(Rev. 15:3,4) This song is now sung by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">144,000 </span><span class="font3">gathered with Christ Jesus into God's holy erganization, and it is as it were a new song, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">which only </span><span class="font3">the 144,000 can learn and sing.—Rev. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">14:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; The song of Moses was a testimony then against the unfaithful ones of Israel, and the song sung today by those under the Greater Moses must be sung in the errs of those who have proved unfaithful to their covenant to do the will of God and as a testimony against them. (Deut. 31:19-22) In due time judgment will be executed upon the unfaithful. (Deut. 32:27x28, 33) Judgment with Jehovah is not in vain or unimportant, but is sure and of the greatest importance. (Deut. 32:46,47) Jehovah had made pro-visin </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">and arrangement for judgment of natural Israel </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">now he has likewise made provision for the judgment of spiritual Israel, which judgment takes pihceaf rtie itempie. It is a time of joy, and therefore a time for isinging, because the spiritual Israelites taken </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font3">fo&gt;r the name of Jehovah, to whom he has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">given hie </span><span class="font3">name, making them his witnesses, are now entering into war and, proving faithful, shall soon enter into the everlasting ‘land of promise’. The Grwrer Moses, the King, is with them, and he is certain to lead the faithful ones to complete victory and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It is the time of the joy of the Lord and the faithful have been invited to enter into his joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFULNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> In every covenant in the making of which two or more parties are involved there must be a good and valuable consideration moving from one to the other. The faithful performance of the terms and provisions of the covenant constitutes a good and valuable consideration of one to the other. Jehovah by the terms of his covenant binds himself to keep and perform the same, and those on the other side of the covenant arc likewise bound to keep and perform the terms thereof. Jehovah is always faithful, and the other parties to the covenant must be faithful if they would please God and be used to accomplish his purposes. “Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations.” (l)eut. 7:9) It is by the faithfulness to Jehovah and the faithfulness of those whom he takes into the covenant for the kingdom that his name will be vindicated. (Isa. 49: 7) Throughout the book of Deuteronomy the pervading counsel is faithful devotion to Jehovah. Those whom God approves, and who shall have a part in the vindication of his name, shall be “Holiness unto the Lord”. (Zech. 14: 20) The call to the kingdom was issued and many responded to that call, and those who proved faithful up to the time of the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple were chosen, and now the “called and chosen” who are taken into the covenant for the kingdom must prove faithful. (Rev. 17:14) Only those who are faithful unto death shall receive the crown of life. (Rev. 2:10) Those who were once in line for the kingdom and who arc not faithful fail. ‘They arc the very f toward generation, children in whom there is no faith.’—Dcut. 32:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’’Hoses was “faithful in all his house”, and his faithfulness was a testimony to those who followed. Christ Jesus is faithful over his royal house; and the condition named in the covenant for the kingdom is that all members thereof must be faithful. (Ilcb. 3:5,6) “Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.” (1 Thess. 5: 24) “But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.” —2 Thess. 3: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> Jehovah condescends to assure those who are in the covenant of his own faithfulness, and faithfulness is required of all those who arc taken into the covenant. Therefore those in the covenant for the kingdom arc admonished, “Be yc holy; for I am holy.” (1 Pet. 1:15,16; Lev. 11: 44) Those who are in the covenant for the kingdom are righteous or just by virtue of being in Christ and having received the robe of righteousness, and “the just shall live by his faith” and faithfulness.—Hab. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” The covenant made in Egypt and confirmed at Mount Sinai required of the Israelites faithfulness, and they pledged themselves faithfully to keep the terms of the covenant. The covenant made in Moab was enjoined upon Israel because Jehovah foreknew that there would be stubbornness, rebellion and lawlessness amongst the people of the nation of Israel after the death of Moses. (Dcut. 5:1-33; 31:16-30) The covenant in Moab, therefore, was of necessity for faithfulness on the part of the Israelites, which faithfulness would be shown by full obedience to God’s commandments. The Israelites had now become the chosen people of God, and they must prove faithful if they would have God's approval and his blessing. “And Moses, and the priests the Levites, spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, 0 Israel; this day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.” (Dcut. 27:9,10) Compare this with the commandment of the Lord God to those who are taken into the temple, to wit: “And this shall come to pass, if yc will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.” (Zech. 6:15) It is these faithful ones that become pillars in the temple of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> There is no mention made in the Scriptures of animal sacrifice and the sprinkling of blood at the making of the covenant in Moab, even though that was the day of the new moon. (2 Chron. 2:4) In the divine record of Leviticus and Numbers the priests, tabernacle and animal sacrifice are made foremost, but not so in the making of the covenant in Moab. This shows that faithfulness is the keynote to that covenant in Moab and that the sacrificial provisions, which prefigured the ransom sacrifice and the atonement work of Christ, would of themselves be insufficient and unavailing for those who were taken out as a people lor Jehovah’s name as against any Israelite’s going into captivity to Satan’s organization, and into death, unless those in the covenant were wholly and faithfully obedient to their vows. In other words, they must be faithful, above everything else. (Deut. 23:21-23) Jehovah had selected these Israelites as his people to go into Canaan, and now the allimportant thing to them was faithful obedience to the voice of Jehovah. (Deut. 6:1-3) Later Jehovah by his prophet said to that nation: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and cat flesh. For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.” (Jer. 7 : 21-23) This proves that those taken into the kingdom covenant must be obedient to the commandments of the Greater Moses and that obedience is better than sacrifice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> As further proof that the covenant made in Moab pictured the covenant for the kingdom, note the following: The kingdom is Jehovah God’s kingdom, which he prepares and gives to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. The things pertaining to the kingdom are pictured by a great mountain of rock, and in the song written and sung by Moses in Moab at the command of Jehovah there for the first time in the Scriptures it is that Jehovah is called The Rock. He is The Rock, and al) his works are perfect. He is the “King of eternity’’. (Jer. 10:10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> He is the great Refuge and Protector of his people. (I)eut. 32:4,15, 18,30,31) Jehovah is definitely named in Deuteronomy as the King. “And he was king in Jcshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.’’ (Deut. 33:5) This shows that the faithful remnant are brought into the covenant for the kingdom after the gathering of Jehovah’s saints to him at the temple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> In the book of Exodus Jehovah makes promise to the Israelites conditioned upon their faithfulness to their covenant made with him when he took them out of Egypt, and says: “Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” (Ex. 19: G) But the instructions concerning the future king of Israel are definitely laid down in the book of Deuteronomy. (17:14-20; 28:36) The important conditions to be performed by those who become ultimately members of the royal house, Jehovah announced as these: “If ye will obey my voice.” Likewise those who shall be for ever in the royal house of Jehovah must now be wholly obedient unto the Greater Moses, and there is no alternative.—Acts 3:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LEVIRATE MARRIAGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The law governing levirate marriage is set forth in the book of Deuteronomy in connection with the Moab covenant, and in no other place in the Scriptures. '(Dvut. 25:5-10) The one next report in the Bible of the actual application of the law of levirate marriage is that in connection with the royal tribe of Judah in behalf of the king who was to come through that tribe. (Gen. 38:1-30; Ruth, chapters one to four) It is manifest that the law of levirate marriage was a kingdom provision, with which law Jehovah’s remnant must comply in fulfilment of the prophetic picture God made by Naomi and Ruth in bringing forth fruit toward the kingdom and in harmony with the covenant for the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> In the covenant at Moab Jehovah’s name takes the most prominent place. Before the making of the covenant in Moab the issue of the name and supremacy of Jehovah was not perceived; likewise before the building up of Zion and taking the remnant into the temple God’s selected people did not perceive the great issue of Jehovah’s name and supremacy. “Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.” (Deut. 29:4) When the King had come to his throne, and the faithful remnant were gathered unto him at the temple, they perceived for the first time the great issue of Jehovah's name, and thereafter they are known as the Lord’s ‘willing ones in the day of his power’, and they delight to make known the name of Jehovah, “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110:3) The fear of that great and terrible name is necessary to continued faithfulness.—Deut. 28:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The song of judgment spoken by Moses on the occasion of making the covenant in Moab puts forward the name of Jehovah and shows that it must be published abroad by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, and concerning these it is written: “For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.” (Deut. </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">32:3</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.U.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah delivered his captive people in 1919 from Satan’s organization, and this was foreshadowed by the Moab covenant. God's covenant people had been scattered and ill-used, restrained and caused to cease from their work, and this was done at the hands of the enemy. Jehovah did not deliver them for the sake of the remnant, but for his own name's sake and to forestall the enemy's reproach against that holy name. In proof of this it is written: “I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men; were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge amiss, lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, and Jehovah hath not done all this.”—Deut. 32:26.27, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.li.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">.<sup>21</sup> In making the covenant in Moab and before crossing the Jordan into Canaan Jehovah states his purpose to choose one place for his house or temple and to there put his name. In this Jehovah foreshadowed and foretold that, when Zion is budded up and the remnant gathered to the temple under Christ Jesus and when God puts his name, all sacrifice of praise and service must be done according to the rules of that organization and through his organization, and not according to every man's own whim or desire. “But unto the place which the Lord your God shad choose out of all your tribes to put his name theie, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your ilocks.” (Deut. 12; 5, 6) Jehovah’s work must be done according to the rules of his organization. “Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.” (Deut. 12:8) Some .persons who have been brought into Zion and anointed have failed to see the necessity of being entirely obedient to the instructions coming to them through God's organization. They do not appreciate the fact that the Lord Jesus is the head of Zion and that the instructions come from him. Those heady ones insist on doing ‘whatsoever is right in their own sight ’, and such is against the commandment of the Lord. (Dcut. 12:8) Jehovah’s name can he honored only by doing his will, and not by following the will of any man. (Dent. 26: 1,2; J’rov. 3: 5, 6) The vindication of Jehovah’s name is magnified as the most important matter, and the part that the remnant would have in the vindication of that holy name is suggested in the law of leviratc marriage, which was later illustrated and recorded in the book of Ruth, the meaning of which God makes known to his remnant after they are brought into the temple and into the covenant for the kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> All who receive Jehovah’s approval as his chosen people must maintain their integrity toward him. This is the very thing the Devil said that man could not do; but the faithful will prove that they can do it. The song of Moses at Moab magnifies the greatness of Jehovah’s name. Therein Jehovah’s integrity, his blamelessness and iiis irreproachableness are declared: “lie is the Rock, his work [including the remnant taken out for his name] is perfect.” (Deut. 32:4) Any crookedness, lawlessness or corruption on the part of any of the professed people of God cannot be attributed to Jehovah, but it must be said of all such, “They have corrupted themselves; their spot (stain or blemish] is not the spot of his children | Jehovah's faithful ones] : they (the lawless ones, the elective elders who insist on doing their own selfish way, the ‘man of sin’, the ‘evil servant’ class] are a perverse and crook&lt; d (therefore not Jehovah’s] generation.” — Deut. 32:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah will not tolerate lawlessness, faultfinding, or complaining on the part of those brought into the covenant for the kingdom. This was foreshadowed by the song concerning the Moab covenant, in which the Lord said concerning the lawless: “And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will sec what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.”—Deut. 32: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Those who will have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name must maintain their integrity toward him, and hence it is written: “Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.” (Deut. 18:13) Jehovah will not give victory to his chosen people because they deserve it, nor because of their inherent righteousness and of their self-development, but for the vindication of his expressed promise and his name.—Dcut. 9:4-6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ONE JEHOVAH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Those taken into the covenant for the kingdom have now begun to appreciate the truth that there is but one Jehovah God; and many others claiming to 1 e God’s children arc blind to this great truth. Jehovah’s supremacy is affirmed in the covenant at Moab, and it is to those in the covenant for the kingdom that this great truth is now magnified: “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath arc the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from liefore thee; and shall say, Destroy them.” (Deut. 33:26,27) Those who desire so to do may choose another for their god and take the consequences, but the faithful will be wholly devoted to Jehovah God. Jehovah now calls to the would-be gods of the enemy for a final show-down. This truth he caused Moses to speak, and now the time has come to settle the great issue and God’s chosen people must declare his purpose and his judgments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> There are not several Jehovahs, each having a different will and a different work. There is but one God. The remnant now see and appreciate their divinely-given privilege of proclaiming the name of the one and only true Jehovah God, and this they do with gnat gladness of heart. As it was said to natural Israel in Moab so now the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, says to the spiritual Israelites gathered to the temple: “Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart.” (Dcut. G: 4-6) The true and faithful saints worship the one and only true God, and this is the first commandment, that is, first in time, and first in importance, as Jesus declared. (Mark 12: 29, 30) This first commandment is made a part of the covenant for the kingdom. Jehovah alone must be worshiped, above all else. (Deut. G: 1-8) The people taken out from the nations for his name must be ‘holiness unto Jehovah’, meaning that they must be entirely devoted to Jehovah God, and that they shall not tempt Jehovah, nor shall they compromise with the enemy and his organization, because such will not be tolerated by Jehovah.—Dcut. 6:16; Matt. 4: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The things enjoined upon natural Israel by the covenant at Moab arc now required of those in the covenant for the kingdom, to wit, Jehovah must be served with joy, and not with complaining, else a curse shall fall upon those failing to properly serve him. (Deut. 28:47) Sacrifices unto him must be unblemished ; hence there must be no compromise with or mixing of the things and practices of the Devil’s organization with the work of Jehovah, such as man worship, this being the “sin of Samaria”. Manifestly God’s purpose is that his people must knowingly, willingly and joyfully be entirely devoted to him. (Deut. 16:21,22) The service of Jehovah must be rendered at the place which he has chosen to put his name, which means in his organization, of which Christ Jesus is the head. (Deut. 16:10-17) Anyone who thinks he is in line for the kingdom and insists cn going his own way and not observing and walking with God's organization is violating this rule of the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> Tithe, which is the tenth part, symbolically represents all one has and which must be given for the temple service and must be presented at the place of his name, that is to say, at his organization. (Deut. 26:1-19; 12:6; 14:22-29) ‘’Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (Hal. 3:10) There must be unity of worship and service at God’s temple, the place of his name, (l)eut. 12:5-18; 16:1-17) Those toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated were gathered into the temple and taken into the covenant for the kingdom and are at unity with Christ, and they must all continue in unity in faithfulness and service. Individual desires or opinions are not at all to be considered. They having become members of God’s organization, individuality of creatures ceases and any opinions held by them contrary to God’s expressed will are wrong. The first thing to be considered is what is the will of God, and all in the covenant for the kingdom must joyfully and harmoniously and obediently respond to his will. Those who take a different course, and hence a lawless course, are certain to be gathered out of the kingdom. Only those who maintain their integrity, continuing in unity and in faithfulness in Christ, will shine forth as the sun when the others are gathered out. (Matt. 13:41-43) Their all must be and will be wholly devoted to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS PROPHET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> It was in Moab that Moses first divulged Jehovah’s promise to raise up a Prophet of whom Moses was merely a shadow or type, (Deut. 18:15-19) Not until the bringing of the remnant into the temple was the truth revealed to them that Christ Jesus alone is that great prophet, foretold by Moses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933. pages 147-153) The preeminence of Jehovah’s prophet is foretold in the words recorded in Deuteronomy in connection with the covenant made there. (Deut. 34:10-12) Therefore those to whom the Greater Moses is sent are in a position of far greater responsibility than the people of natural Israel were ever in. The remnant, now being informed of the great issue that is to be settled, and being in the covenant for the kingdom, see that there can be no compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, but that the remnant must be unreservedly and absolutely devoted to and obedient to Jehovah and his great Prophet. The Greater Moses prepared the way before Jehovah, then came straightway to the temple and gathered unto himself the saints of Jehovah, and then brought into the covenant for the kingdom those who had up to that point of time proved their faithfulness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Thereafter the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, as Jehovah’s instrument began to unfold to the remnant the meaning of prophecy, and it becomes a matter of choice for them to choose between Jehovah’s great Prophet and Servant or the Devil’s mouthpiece and representative. Many who think they represent God are in fact Satan’s dupes and instruments. As many of the natural Israelites became unfaithful, even so now there are those who are in line for the kingdom who become unfaithful, and these unfaithful ones fail to give heed to the Greater Prophet. Those in line for the kingdom who now fail or refuse to render wholehearted and loving obedience to Christ will come to a disastrous end.—Deut. 18:13-19; Acts 3: 19-23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> The death of Moses did not take away leadership from Israel, because Joshua succeeded him and led the Israelites into Canaan. Concerning the kingdom covenant foreshadowed by the covenant made at Moab, the invincible leadership by Jehovah’s great Prophet, Christ Jesus, is guaranteed to the remnant. These faithful ones are entirely and fully assured that if they abide in the temple and faithfully and joyfully obey God’s great Prophet, they shall be brought through with complete victory to the praise of Jehovah’s name. This victory is not by what they do, but it is the victory of Jehovah accomplished for them by Christ Jesus as his great instrument and for the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s great name.—1 Cor. 15:57.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, is conducting judgment at the temple according to the will of God. Uis promise is that those taken into the covenant with him for the kingdom shall sit with him in the judgment of the twelve tribes of Israel. This must mean primarily all of those who go to make up the spiritual Israelites, that is to say, spirit-begotten ones, out of which the royal house is taken. From this promise of the Lord it is reasonably proper to conclude that the faithful resurrected saints, gathered unto Zion first, are having some part in the judgment, the details of which are not revealed to us. The question then is, Do those still remaining on earth, that is, the faithful remnant, have any part in this judgment ? and the scripture appropriate to this question is: ‘‘Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.” (1 Cor. 4:5) The Lord, the great Judge, has come, and he has caused the faithful who are taken into the covenant for the kingdom to sit with him in heavenly places, that is to say, in the temple. It is therefore the time for judgment, and it seems clear that the work of the remnant who are yet on earth in connection with the judgment is that of declaring the judgments of Jehovah already written, and thus they have a part in the judgment. The name of Jehovah now must be made known; his vengeance must be declared; but it is the faithful remnant, constituted his witnesses, that are permitted to make proclamation of these truths. The remnant are not to pass upon the guilt or innocence of any individual, but they are to declare the law or rules of Jehovah’s judgment, •which apply to the obedient and to the disobedient. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font3">this manner those in the covenant for the kingdom are now having a part in the judgment work according to the will of the Lord. Jehovah’s judgments are already written, and his saints gathered unto him are commissioned to declare, and must declare, his judgments. This they do with songs of praise, and Jehovah takes pleasure in their faithfulness in performing their duties in this respect. Concerning this it is written by God’s prophet: “For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the fnations], and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.’’ (Ps. 149:4-9) Jehovah discloses to his faithful ones his will concerning them.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE PATIENCE OF JOB</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3">FFLICTION and suffering which arc being endured by many who live upon earth today are closely related to the bitter experiences of Job, concerning which we read in the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many long centuries Satan has been the god of ■this world. His chief purpose has been to blind men to the truth of God’s Word, lest any such should see God’s purpose and learn the true way to life. (2 Cor. 4:3-6) To accomplish this purpose he has used his entire organization; but the chief among the members thereof have been and are the religious leaders. These have been and are now supported by the principal of their flock, made up of the elite, the ultrarieh and the professional politicians. Such men have posed and still pose as the representatives of God, while willfully practicing fraud and deceit upon the people. The clergy or preachers have assumed great piety and selfrighteousness. They have made the big property owners and the professional politicians the chief ones in their congregations. These proud and haughty ones have received special favor. They have been held before the ‘common herd’ as examples of God’s favor. The preachers have set them forth as examples to be followed, and by this means many of the poor and ignorant and superstitious ones have been brought into the religious organizations and induced to lay their small earnings at the feet of the hypocrites. When the rich and the selfish politicians have seen fit to make war on others, the preachers have harangued the common people and told them it is their duty to give their life and everything they have to support and maintain and fight for a selfish organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These religious frauds have not spoken to the poor people about God’s gracious purpose of redemption and how he would bring life to the obedient ones by resurrection and the kingdom blessings. On the contrary, they extolled the virtues of men, called them men of character, and advised the poor in the church system to develop a character and grow like the great men and thereby work out their own salvation, and by this means to assure themselves a place in heaven or the unseen condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These false loaders and would-be comforters have urged upon the people the patriotic support of unrighteous rulers. They have told them that patriotism means the unqualified support of the men who are really their oppressors. By this means they have induced the poor to spill their own blood in defense of the Devil’s organization. The common people have been told by these three elements that unless they join themselves with the religious systems and support them earnestly the great God, for whom these claim to speak, will consign all who fail so to do to hell or torment eternal in duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be sure, the great Jehovah God foreknew the cruel and wicked system that Satan would create and organize and carry on to deceive men and to turn them away from the true God. He foreknew that the most wicked instrument in that system would be the religious element that would assume to speak in the name of God. He foreknew that these would be and arc hypocrites, and would practice subtlety and hypocrisy. He knew that they would be aided and upheld and supported by the rich and professional politicians operating the governments, and that thereby the masses of people would be held under the supervision, power and control of Satan, the wicked one. God permitted the three men, who claimed to be Job’s comforters, to be used to foreshadow that wicked organization. God also foreknew that amongst all of those vile and subtle influences of Satan’s organization there would be a few men who would maintain their confidence in Him and would be faithful to him regardless of all persecution and suffering that might be heaped upon them. This class he would picture by Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God used Abraham and his descendants to make a picture concerning his purpose of vindicating his name by the “seed” of promise, through which seed also the blessings would come to mankind. Now he would use Job to make a picture showing the battle of mankind against the evil power and influence of Satan, and showing how in due time God would bring forth a class of men who would resist the Devil, trust absolutely in God, joyfully avail themselves of the good offices of the great Redeemer and the Almighty, and receive life everlasting. The picture made by Abraham and his descendants had to do more particularly with those who have faith like unto that of Abraham. The picture of Job is wider in scope, because it pertains to the entire human race and proves that God’s ultimate blessing to suffering humanity is life everlasting on earth through the great Redeemer and minister of the kingdom favors. With this view’ of the picture in mind, consider now some parts of the argument indulged in by Job and the three frauds who claimed to speak in the name of God but who really spoke for the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Doubtless Satan reasoned that the long and hypocritical stare of the three pious frauds would produce such a torture upon Job, and so increase his sufferings, that Job would curse God. What could be more tantalizing to a suffering one than to be compelled to sit for days the object of the constant gaze of a self-righteous “bunch” of hypocrites? Satan was using this subtle method to overcome Job. Again he was doomed to defeat. The long silence was broken by Job’s pronouncing a curse upon the day of his birth, but not one word of reproach against God. He did not complain of what he had lost, but he appealed to God that his I<sup>;</sup>fc might end and that his sufferings might be done. “And Job spake, and said, Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.” (Job 3:2-5) Then Job adds that, had he never been born, now he would be quiet and free from suffering. “For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest.”—Job 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fully realizing that God had given him life and that it was God’s entire right to take it away he only asked that his suffering might end in death. How well do these words of Job represent the condition and thoughts of many men w’ho have suffered affliction. Conscious of the fact that they have tried to do right, yet suffering great bodily pain and mental anguish, they have wondered why they were ever born, and they long to rest in death. Not knowing of God’s purpose of redemption and blessing, they have prayed that their sufferings might cease and that they might rest in the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, in response to Job, Eliphaz the Tcmanite speaks. Esau, or Edom, from whom Eliphaz descended, always represented the Devil’s organization. Esau pictured the class that persecutes the true servants of God. Eliphaz now docs the same thing. Mark the hypocritical and subtle words that fall from his lips. “If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?” (Job 4:2) Was that professed friend there to comfort Job? Had he been, then he would have told Job that his affliction and suffering had come upon him by inheritance because of the sin of Adam. (Ps. 51: 5; Rom. 5:12) He would have told Job that his relief would come in God’s due time through the ministration of the great Redeemer whose lifeblood would provide the price to lift the curse from men. He made no mention of that to Job, but rather magnified his own importance and that of his two fellow frauds. Look now at the conditions that have long existed, and that which has been taught to the people by the Devil’s organization, represented by the three professed friends of Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do the leaders of that satanie organization, who claim to speak in the name of God, tell suffering humanity that such suffering is by reason of inherited sin committed by Adam, who yielded to the Devil? Do they tell them that God is the only true and mighty One, and that he has made provision through the death and resurrection of Jesus his beloved Son to redeem mankind from death and the grave? Do they tell the people that in due time God, through Christ, will give a fair trial for life to all mankind, and that the obedient ones shall then be restored to health, happiness and life everlasting on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No! Far from that! The clergy even deny hereditary sin. They deny that the blood of Jesus is the great redemptive price for man. They vehemently deny the great truth of life on earth through resurrection and the kingdom. They go in the very opposite direction. They magnify their own saintliness and point with great pride to the very “saintly” preachers who have gone before them, and they bid suffering humanity to follow their example. The Devil well knows that honest men despise hypocrites or those who pose as holy within themselves, lie well knows that honest men turn away from the God whose professed representatives thus teach, and Satan’s hope has been to turn men away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eliphaz reminded Job that at one time he had instructed many and strengthened many feeble knees, and that now calamity had come upon Job and because of fear he quailed and cried. Then with the manifest purpose of reminding Job that his suffering was due to the direct judgment of God against him because of his own wickedness, he said to Job: “Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.”—Job 4:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That statement of Eliphaz was a lie. How many clergymen have boldly stated that the suffering of men. is directly the judgment of God upon them because of failure to pay their vows to him through the church systems! How many clergymen have even refused a decent burial of the dead, because neither the dead nop their living friends had supported their unrighteous organization! Satan, the father of such falsehoods, has put them forth through his agents for the purpose of inducing men to curse God. Many men have declared that if that is the kind of God we have, they want nothing to do with him. A few have rc-fused to believe in the words of the clergy, and have yet held confidence in God and his mercy and loving-kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then Eliphaz magnified before Job his own greatness and wisdom, by declaring to Job that he had a vision from the Lord and from which he had received much knowledge in secret. At the time of that vision he heard a voice saying to him: “Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his 'Maker ? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly. How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which arc crushed before the moth?”—Job 4:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eliphaz’ speech was that mortal man cannot be justified, and that only God afflicts man and there is no appeal. Manifestly Eliphaz’ statement, originating with Satan, was false and intended to turn Job against God. He then claims that God charges his angels with folly, the purpose of Eliphaz being to discredit God in the mind of Job. The leaders of “Christendom”, so called, have always falsely misrepresented God, and have told the suffering people that he is harsh and cruel and that those who die outside of their church systems are doomed to eternal torment without mercy, and that there is no appeal that can bo made by those who are outside of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then Eliphaz, seemingly in derision, says: “Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? For wrath kill-cth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly 1 cursed his habitation. His children arc far from safety, and they arc crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.” (Job 5:1-4) That was not much comfort to Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, that this hypocritical comforter might stress his own greatness and high standing with God, and with mockery in his words, he says: “Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks tly upward. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause; which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number.”—Job 5:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job recognized and acknowledged the greatness of God, but he received torment instead of consolation from the words of Eliphaz. In agony Job cried out: “Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! Even that it would please God to destroy me; that lie would let loose his hand, and cut me off! Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.” (Job 6:8-10) Yet Job cursed not Jehovah God. With true patience, or steadfastness in that which is right, he maintained his integrity toward God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ALL </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the paths of Jehovah are mercy and truth veto such as keep his covenant and J:ts testimonies. The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him; and he Kill show them his covenant.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">david.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CORRUPTING OF CHRISTIANITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">R</span><span class="font3">OME was in ancient times a great world power of which Satan was then (even as he still is) the god. (2 Cor. 4:3,4) It was in the fourth century that this great world power adopted the Christian religion as the religion of the state or government. Thereby the Devil succeeded in having the people call themselves by the name of God and of his Christ and at the same time constantly bring reproach upon the name of the Lord, and in fact represent the Devil. To show how stealthily and fraudulently the Devil overreached the people and turned their minds from the true God the following is quoted from the history entitled &quot;Old Itoman World&quot;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;In the second century there are no greater names than Polycarp, Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Clement, Meli to and Apollonius, quiet bishops or intrepid martyrs, who addressed their Hocks in upper chambers, and who held no worldly rank, famous only for their sanctity or simplicity of character, and only mentioned for their sufferings and faith. We read of martyrs, some of whom wrote valuable treatises and apologies; but among them we find no people of rank. It was a disgrace to be a Christian in the eye of fashion or power. The early Christian literature is chiefly apologetic, and the doctrinal character is simple and practical. There were controversies </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font3"> the church, and intense religious life, great activities, great virtues, but no outward conflict, no secular history. They had not as yet assailed the government or the great social institutions of the empire. It was a small body of pure and blameless men, who did not aspire to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">control society.</span><span class="font3"> But they had attracted the notice of the government and were of sufficient consequence to be persecuted. They were looked upon as fanatics who sought to destroy a reverence for existing institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;In this [second] century the polity of the church was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quietly organized.</span><span class="font3"> There was an organized fellowship among the members; bishops had become influential, not in society, but among the Christians; dioceses and parishes were established; there was a distinction between city and rural bishops; delegates of churches assembled to discuss points of faith or suppress nascent heresies; the diocesan system was developed, and ecclesiastical centralization commenced; deacons began to be reckoned among the higher clergy; the weapons of excommunication were forged; missionary efforts were carried on; the festivals of the church were created; Gnosticism was embraced by many leading minds; catechetical schools taught the faith systematically; the formulas of baptism and the sacraments became of great importance; and mona-chism became popular. The church was thus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">laying the foundation of its future polity and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The third century</span><span class="font3"> saw the church more powerful as an institution. Regular synods had assembled in the great cities of the empire; the metropolitan system was matured; the canons of the church were definitely enumerated; great schools of theology attracted inquiring minds; the doctrines were systematized [that is, defined, limited, and formulated into creeds and confessions of faith], Christianity had spread so extensively that it must needs be either persecuted or legalized; great bishops ruled the growing church; great doctors [of divinity] speculated on the questions [philosophy and science falsely so called] which had agitated the Grecian schools; church edifices were enlarged, the banquets instituted in honour of the martyrs. The church was rapidly advancing to a position which extorted the attention of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“It was not till the fourth century—</span><span class="font3">when imperial persecution had stopped; when [the Roman emperor! Constantine was converted; when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the church was allied with the state;</span><span class="font3"> when the early faith was itself corrupted ; when superstition and vain philosophy had entered the ranks of the faithful; when bishops became courtiers; when churches became both rich and splendid; when synods were brought under political influence; when monachists [monks] had established a false principle of virtue; when politics and dogmalies went hand in hand and emperors enforced the decrees of [church] councils—that men of rank entered the church. When Christianity became the religion of the court and of the fashionable classes, it- was used to support the very evils against which it originally protested. The church was not only impregnated with the errors of pagan philosophy, but it adopted many of the ceremonies of oriental worship, which were both minute and magnificent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;The church became, in the fourth century, as imposing as the old temples of idolatry. Festivals became frequent and imposing. The people clung to them because they obtained excitement and a cessation from labor. Veneration for martyrs ripened into the introduction of images—a future source of popular idolatry. Christianity was emblazoned in pompous ceremonies. The veneration for saints approximated to their deification, and superstition exalted the mother of our Lord into an object of absolute worship. Communion tables became imposing altars typical of Jewish sacrifices, and the relics of martyrs were preserved as sacred amulets. Monastic life also ripened into a great system of penance and expiatory rites. Armies of monks retired to gloomy and isolated places, and abandoned themselves to rhapsodies and fastings and self-expiation. They were a dismal and fanatical set of men, overlooking the practical aims of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The clergy, ambitious and worldly, sought rank and distinction. They even thronged the courts of princes and aspired to temporal honors. They were no longer supported by the voluntary contributions of the faithful, but by revenues supplied by the government, or property inherited from the old [pagan] temples. Great legacies were made to the church by the rich, and these the clergy controlled. These bequests became sources of inexhaustible wealth. As wealth increased and was intrusted to the clergy, they became indifferent to the wants of the people—no longer supported by them. They became lazy, arrogant and independent. The people were shut out of the government of the church. The bishop became a grand personage who controlled and appointed his clergy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The church was allied with the state,</span><span class="font3"> and religious dogmas were enforced by the sword of the magistrate.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">iso</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">“An imposing hierarchy was established, of various grades, which culminated in the bishop of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The emperor decided points of faith, and the clergy were exempted from the burdens of the state. There was a great Hocking to the priestly offices when the clergy wielded so much power and became so rich; and men were elevated to great sees [bishoprics], not because of their piety or talents, but their influence with the great. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The mission of the church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the state.</span><span class="font3"> Christianity was a pageant, a ritualism, an arm of the state, a vain philosophy, a superstition, a formula.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the enemy was, of course, at all times in control of Pagan Rome. The religion of that world power was the Devil’s own religion. lie now adopted hypocritically the Christian religion; his world power took on the name of Papal Rome, having a visible representative under the name and title of “pope”, who claimed to be the representative of the Lord Jesus Christ but who in fact was the representative of the Devil, whether he knew it or not. Millions of good people were deceived by this hypocritical move. Probably many of the clergy were deceived, but surely some of them were not deceived. The pope presumptuously assumed to rule as the visible representative of Christ. For a thousand jears Papal Rome held sway over the nations of the earth; and, though deprived of her temporal power in A.D. 1800, she yet exercises </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">tremendous power amongst the governments of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During all this period of time the papal system has quoted the words of the apostle Peter (1:2:9), which read: “But ye arc a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light,” the papal system claiming to be the chosen people there mentioned by the Lord. But we see that this claim is absolutely false. The nation mentioned by the inspired apostle is a holy nation; and instead of the Roman empire’s being holy and the Roman church’s being holy there have been some of the blackest crimes of history committed in the name of and by that system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some God-fearing men protested in the name of Christ against the wicked reign of this system. Wyc-liff, Huss, Luther and others made an open warfare against the papacy. The result was the Protestant denominations, called the Protestant church, organized in the name of Christ. These denominations, of course, contained many good, God-fearing men; but it was only a matter of time until Satan overreached these. These Protestant systems have organized themselves into real political companies. It has been well said that the Methodist denomination is one of the strongest political organizations in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These various denominations have deemed it their business and commission to convert the world, and therefore think it necessary to bring into their denominations the rich and the influential. They have opened the doors to such and have made them the principal ones of their flocks. They havfc' organized the clergy, as distinguished from the laity; and tin sc clergy meet in councils and synods and control the system or denomination, and use it for political purposes. They make themselves a part of the world and claim that their denominations constitute God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking to such James says: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) The word “adulterer” here used does not refer to a lack of chastity between the sexes, but it means an illicit relationship between church and the world of which Satan is god. It means that these ecclesiastical systems have made friendship with Satan’s organization and have entered into an alliance with the commercial and the political powers of the world; and all together they constitute the visible part of Satan’s organization, which is designated in the Scriptures under the title and symbol of “beast”.— Rev. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now in more modern times these ecclesiastical systems, claiming to represent the Lord, are presided over by a class of clergymen who call themselves “modernists”. It is admitted that the modernists are in the majority in numbers among the clergymen. A modernist is one who denies the Biblical account of man’s creation, denies man’s deflection and sentence to death, denies the great ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ and, of necessity, denies the Lord’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God foreknew that the ecclesiastical systems, Catholic and Protestant, in the name of Christ would be overreached by the Devil and used for his purposes, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">part of his organization. Through his prophet Jeremiah (2:21-25) God stated: “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim [the Devil]? Sec thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done; thou art a swift dromedary traversing tier ways; a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. 'Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet here shows, in harmony with the facts as wc see them, that eeelesiastieism has turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine, that she has become polluted, that she has gone after Baalim, the Devil religion; that she has been in the valley, between the jiolitieal and financial elements of the Devil’s organization; and, like the characteristic trait of a dromedary or a wild ass, she illicitly runs after the ultrarieh and the ultra-influential, that she might have the plaudits of men and the honor that the world could bring to her. Ecclesiasti-eism did not get this from the Lord God, but it was the result of falling under the influence of Satan the Devil. Hence the Word of Jehovah God plainly declares that eeelesiastieism must be utterly destroyed at the battle of Armageddon, -which is near at hand, in order that his glorious name and his infallible word may be cleared and vindicated before all creation.</span></p>

These two articles are like the opening up of a highway where before there had been only somewhat intricate nairow roads which led nowhere in particular. The fact that there was so much controversy about the new covenant was evidence that the last word had not been said.

<p><span class="font2">Los </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Angeles Broadcast:</span><span class="font2"> First things first! I experienced the greatest thrill of my life early Monday morning when 1 heard the full hour's program from Los Angeles verbatim. I have repeatedly tried to pick up the big hook-ups on the best sets available in Cape Town, but always without success. But on Monday morning from 1: 30 to 2: 30 it was not merely a question of getting reception, but every word came through us clearly as though you had been speaking in the same room. It was thrilling beyond words, and as the climax of each talk was reached and the resolution was read and the great audience at the Shrine Auditorium shouted “Aye’’ in response, the brethren who listened with me and I were almost overcome with joy. It was a real pleasure to join in that great chorus of “ayes’’ which probably was heard in many parts of the earth. The station from which we got reception was W2XAF (Schenectady 31.46 meters). The explanation, of course, was, the time was just right for us to pick up that station and the weather conditions were favorable. From 6: 30 p.m. (the hour of your broadcast Eastern Standard Time) to 10:30 p.m. is the best time for us to pick up American signals. I do hope that it will be possible for you to annnge subsequent big chain broadcasts at the same hour. We had no sleep that night, but we will gladly do without a night's rest at any time to have a repetition of Sunday evening’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companies were all notified beforehand and we arranged to give as much publicity as possible to the broadcast. Telegrams received from the brethren indicate that reception was good throughout the country wherever brethren had suliieient-ly powerful sets to pick up America. Kimberley, Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and other towns have all reported excellent reception. I think this is the first time your voice has been heard diiect in this country. I hope the day may yet come when wa will be able to see you as well as hear you! I enclose a letter received this morning from Bloemfontein. It is tin- first lefter we have received at the office from this gentleman, and he, as yet, is not on our files. Be apparently has seen the advert in the local newspaper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have pleasure in informing you that I picked up Station W2XAF Schenectady this morning at 1: 30 n.m. on my 16 valve Mid-West machine and heard Judge Rutherford’s great message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reception was excellent, very distinct and of great educational value. Although the judge spoke rather fast, each word was clear and a message in itself. At the end of his hour’s address I found myself joining in saying “Aye’’ as being in favor of his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kindly let me know when Judge Rutherford will be on tho air again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wishing Jehovah’s witnesses every success,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours faithfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alex.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pe;-ters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPENS OUR EYES TO HIS SECRETS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report for our studies at Helsinki Bethel in April, 1934, is following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Satisfied with Thy Likeness” was the first of our articles, with its wonderful news. That Bible text, so many times lead, is now quite new and brings us surprisingly near the Laid. It is so, that we of oursehes do not see anything, although we stand in the midst of glorious things, before the I.md opens our eyes to his secrets. Praised be his glorious name. The oilier article studied was “His Name”, first part. Also it shows most interesting fulfilments of prophecy and diav.s us close to the last tremendous happenings, when God deliveis His people and all creatures from bondage. All these explanations have thrilled our hearts ami help us better to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There have been at the studies: April 3, 15 persons; 10th, 9; 17th, 13; and 24th, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our daily prayer before the throne of grace is. tliat our dear Lord may give you strength to continue in his service with that vigor with which you have done it until this time by the Lord’s help. We all send our hearty Christian gieetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your little brother by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hero Nironen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">POSSIBILITIES BOUNDLESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font2">company of the ‘remnant-servant’ in service assembly at Portsmouth, England, desire to place on record their heartfelt gratitude to Jehovah for the gracious privilege of hearing for the first time in these Isles your inspiring message, “His Organization,” by electrical transcription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every one present is thrilled to have this personal message, a message so clear and positive, making plain beyond all question of doubt that we are engaged in the greatest cause under the sun. Truly the commawls of Jehovah to his people in these days are mandatory and absolute, not optional or discretionary, and we are determined to obey these commands, not as unto man, but as unto Jehovah himself, the Head of this glorious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The possibilities of the transci iption work are boundless, and we praise Jehovah for such provision. Well may it be that as we draw nearer to the final battle, and the forces of Gog become more savage and subtle in their attacks, it will not even be safe to set down in print some of the war commands from Jehovah; yet the Arm of the Mighty Warrior is not shortened, for by the electrical transci iption you may speak direct to the members of the ‘remnant’, and thus defeat the Devil and any of his attempts to hinder the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daily we remember you befoie Jehovah’s throne of grace, knowing that the prayers of a righteous man (the remnant) hath much power. Hence, with full assurance of faith and hope, we continue on with our brethren everywhere the onward march that leads to victory and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With warm love in Jehovah’s name, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Service Assembly, Portsmouth, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO SERVE ACCEPTABLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Only a few days ago I received your gift, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book, </span><span class="font2">and 1 thank you so much and am rejoicing as I read this . wonderful report of how the Lord is so marvelously prospering his kingdom message to the vindication of his own name. Wools cannot express my deeply felt appreciation for your address to the remnant Sunday, as we were assembled at our contact point. Our loving Jehovah God always supplies the needful assistance at just the proper time. We surely do need to be strengthened and encouraged at this particular time, when Satan is using every subtle means to discourage and deceive the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord bless you and strengthen you, that you may be able to direct, aid and comfort us, that we may ail be able to serve acceptably in the army of Jehovah our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE KINGDOM PRAISE PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This nine-day service period, September 29 to October 7 inclusive, begins the new service year of 1934-1935. It will be enrth-wide in its scope, and it is expected that more lands where some of Jehovah’s witnesses or Jonadabs are located will receive a witness during this period than during any previous like period. In the English-speaking countries Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs will specialize on placing tho new booklet, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler.</span><span class="font1"> In countries of another language the branch office in charge will duly announce the booklet to bo distributed there. And, important! don’t forget reporting your work for the period, ptomptly at the close thereof, to the respective office having supervision over the witness in your part of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO AND THE PRINTED WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All witnessing parties and all individuals who engage in the witness work should mention the radio station in their vicinity that is broadcasting the watchtower programs. This often proves a means of opening tho way to place the books in the hands of the people. ' Have in mind that the chief purpose of the radio is to cull the people’s attention to the truth ami then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding of the message concerning the government of Jehovah by rending what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every one who now participates in the field work in territory served by broadcasts of the watchtower program may have a share in telling the people that this unique service is available each week. Workers report that distribution of the radio folder (supplied by the Society) is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font1"> public notice of this program while engaging in the house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“RIGHTEOUS RULER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another new booklet! The two radio lectures &quot;World Control ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Flee Now ’ ’, with an excellent introduction thereto, bound together under one cover, this cover bearing </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">most inspiring design. Even Jehovah’s witnesses should not fail to read this booklet, not to speak of the Jonaciab class. It may be had for 5c a copy by all such. The beginning of the distribution thereof to the general public is announced elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pursuant to the provision of law and the charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, notice is hmeby given that the annual business meeting of the said Society will be held at Pittsburgh, North Side (formerly Allegheny), Pennsylvania, at 10 o’clock a.m., Wednesday, October dl, 1934, at which the usual annual business will be transacted.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>WICKED SPIRITS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’’—Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH GOD, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Creator of all things good. He has never created a wicked thing, because he is holy and all his works are perfect. (Deut. 32:4) The wicked are these who willfully violate God’s law. When a creature becomes wicked, the responsibility for so doing cannot be laid to .Jehovah. If the creature yields to sinful temptation or influence and turns to wickedness, that cannot be charged to God, for the reason, it is written, that God tcmpls no man. (Jas. 1:13) All the ways of Jehovah God arc right and righteous. God hates wickedness, and he has definitely fixed the destiny of the wicked. “The transgressors shall Ite destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.’’ (I’s. 37: 38) There arc wicked spirit creatures r.nd wicked human creatures, and the end of all such is destruction. (Ps. 145:20) Angels arc spirit creatures, whom Jehovah God created perfect, pure and holy, and all such as have willfully followed the Devil have become wicked. While the judgment of Jehovah plainl.v shows that the wicked shall suffer destruction, that does not mean that the creature is destroyed as soon as or within even a short time after he becomes wicked. Satan is a wicked spirit long ago adjudged guilty and sentenced to death, but God has permitted him to remain for a certain purpose. The Scriptures also show that there arc other spirit creatures long ago condemned by the judgment of Jehovah God for destruction but who are permitted to live until God’s due time to execute them. Such wicked angels have exercised power and influence over man and continue to do so. Following the birth of the “man child” there was a great war in heaven in which Satan and other wicked angels fought on one side against the Lord Jesus Christ, and all such wicked ones were east down to the earth. In this connection it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” —Rev. 12:5-12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> That Satan and his wicked angels at the present time do exercise great influence over the rulers of the earth and bring much woe upon the people there cannot be the slightest doubt, since the evidence is abundant on every hand. Many persons consult these wicked spirit creatures, being entirely ignorant of their origin, what is their purpose, and what will be their end. The men and women who do consult them through mediums are induced by the seductive influence to indulge in many wrongful practices to 1he reproach of Jehovah’s name. Heretofore much has been said and written about wicked angels and their power over men, but now, in the day when the Lord has gathered his faithful ones unto himself, and inaugurated toward them the new covenant, and brought them into the covenant for the kingdom, it should be expected the Lord in his loving-kindness would give to his faithful ones greater light concerning the wicked angels, opening to these faithful ones a better understanding of the Scriptures. We must keep in mind the fact that the apostle authoritatively wrote: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) Therefore it must follow that a proper understanding of these scriptures concerning the wicked angels would bo helpful to the remnant at. the present time. They must understand, if they are to aid the Jonadab eompans-to have a better understanding. In addition thereto God by his apostle makes it clear to the faithful remnant that they are continually assaulted by his horde or host of wicked ones and that they must put on and keep on the armor of protection which Jehovah in his loving-kindness provided for them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">EPITOME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Both Jude and Peter tell of angels that became wicked and arc reserved for destruction. Peter also speaks of certain “spirits in prison”, to which Jesus preached. Who are these wicked angels? When and how did they become wicked'? Who are the ones to whom Jesus preached? and arc the ones in prison the same as the ones who are reserved for the judgment of destruction? What is the present state of habita-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">tion of these wicked ones? It seems that it would be profitable in the consideration of these questions to first set out a brief epitome or abstract of what follows and then try to set forth the Scriptural argument in support of the same; hence the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* There are two separate and distinct classes of angels or spirits mentioned in the sixth chapter of Genesis. One of these classes is designated in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font2"> as “giants”; in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font2"> as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neph-ilim</span><span class="font2"> (verse 4). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nephilim</span><span class="font2"> means “fellers”, bullies or tyrants. Those wicked ones joined Satan in his rebellion and have operated with him since in his wicked endeavors to reproach Jehovah God and to turn all creation away from God. They are the ones mentioned at 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6. They have fought since the days of Eden against those who have tried to be righteous. They are alive and are the mortal enemies of the saints. They will fight on Satan’s side in the battle of Armageddon and suffer complete defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> In the second verse of the sixth chapter of Genesis are mentioned “the sons of God”. These are angels that were once holy and in the service of Jehovah God but' did not join Satan in his rebellion, but afterwards yielded to his subtle and wicked influence, Itecame disobedient, resulting in their losing the privilege and opportunity of serving Jehovah, and have since been imprisoned; they are alive and are the ones mentioned in 1 Peter 3:19, 20; and there is some hope of their recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ In considering the scriptures hereinafter discussed it will be well and profitable to keep in mind the two separate and distinct classes of angels above mentioned and their relation to each other arid to the human race. The remnant and the Jonadab class will both find this matter of peculiar interest at the present time. It is undoubtedly the will of God that a witness concerning these unseen powers and the influence that they exercise over the human race must now be given, and that all who love the Lord must put forth their best endeavors to have a part in this witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REBELLION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ Lucifer, at the time of the creation of man, was a member of God’s organization, appointed and anointed to office. It was his privilege and duty to serve, support and praise Jehovah and render complete obedience to him, and he was fully equipped for that purpose. It is writtenthat Jehovah said of Lucifer: “Thou art the .anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God.” (Ezek. 28:14) This is proof that Lucifer was a part of Jehovah’s organization and appointed and anointed to perform certain duties. It seems quite clear from the Scriptures that Lucifer was the chief officer over a certain division of God's organization, having under him other spirit creatures or angels, and that his organization particularly related to man on the earth. Lucifer rebelled against God and corrupted his sanctuaries “by the multitude of thine iniquities; in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries”. (Ezek. 28:18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> That would mean, that at the beginning of his official term his organization or dwelling-place was devoted to, God and righteousness, but that he willfully became wicked. This would also mean that others joined him in his treasonable course, thus corrupting the dwelling-place of Satan and those in his immediate organization. That Satan has a company of angels that operate with him other scriptures quite clearly prove. That company of wieked angels fought with Satan at the time Christ Jesus cast Satan and his host out of heaven and down to the earth, and their operations are now confined to things pertaining to the earth. (Kev. 12:9-12) At the beginning they were creatures of God, but they rebelled and became the ‘seed of the serpent’, Satan. The Lord Jesus Christ announces Jehovah’s judgment concerning this wicked company led by Satan. (Matt. 25: 41) Satan is tyrannical in the extreme, and those spirits operating with him arc wicked tyrants. From the time of Eden Satan was a murderer, and those who joined him in his rebellion against God doubtless participated in the murder of Abel, and they arc also murderers and have continued to commit murder since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">—.John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> God by his prophet Daniel describes Satan’s wicked organization under the symbol of a terrible image. The head of that image was of gold, picturing Satan himself and showing that ho. originally received his authority from Jehovah. The breast and arms of that image were silver, picturing the princes or assistant rulers under Satan and who form a part of his invisible organization that is wicked; and as it is written that there is “another third kingdom”, of copper, “which shall bear rule over all the earth” (Dan. 2: 31-3.9), this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">statement of Daniel, and</span><span class="font2"> which is corroborated by other scriptures, proves conclusively that the wicked angels under Satan have had dominion or rule over the governments of the earth from the beginning and have exercised the same in a tyrannical manner. The Scriptures make it clear that Satan is the god or invisible ruler of this world; which means that he is the most powerful among all the wicked spirit creatures and that the other wicked ones operate under him, and that the entire organization fights against every' one who is on the side of Jehovah.—2 Cor. 4: 3, 4; Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Among those of his wicked organization is the one termed by the Scriptures “Gog”, Satan’s chief offie«'r, whom doubtless he appointed to correspond to Christ Jesus as the chief officer of Jehovah. This host of wieked ones occupied a place known in the Scriptures as Magog. (Ezek. 3S-.2-6) (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 311.) Jesus referred to Satan as the “prince [or invisible ruler] of this world”. (John 14:30) Since Satan is called Beelzebub, which means prince or chief one of devils, it follows that there are many other like ones, that is to say, wicked angels or spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">—Matt. 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15, 18, 19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> These texts here cited, together with the words of Ephesians 6:10-12, prove beyond all doubt that there is a host of wicked angels or spirit creatures; that Satan the Devil is the chief one of that wicked company; and that all of such are the enemies of God and the mortal enemies of every one who seeks to do God’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> From the very time of Eden God pronounced his judgment of destraction against Satan and his host or “seed”. (Gen. 3:15) Later through his prophet Moses God tells why he did not immediately execute that judgment and destroy Satan and all of his wicked host. 11 is purpose is to permit Satan and his host to go the very limit in opposition to God and in their effort to turn all creation from Jehovah and to prove Jehovah to be a liar; and then in his own due time God will completely destroy such wicked ones and thus demonstrate his own supreme power. Before their destruction, however, Jehovah will have his faithful and loyal witnesses give testimony to his own great name and to bo witnesses before both men and angels. In proof of God’s purpose it is written concerning Satan: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lceser)</span><span class="font2"> It is Satan and his wicked host, invisible to human eyes, that have wrongfully influenced and corrupted the visible rulers of the earth and made the ruling powers of the earth a part of the .wicked organization that oppresses the human race. This visible part of Satan’s organization is pictured by the prophet Daniel as the “legs of iron” and the ‘feet of iron and clay’, (Dan. 2:33) The entire organization under Satan is pitted against Jehovah God; and in due time “the stone”, meaning Christ Jesus, who is made the head of Jehovah’s capital organization and his chief executive officer, will completely destroy that wicked organization of Satan, both visible and invisible.—Dan. 2: 44, 45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> From the day of the rebellion in Eden until now it has been the Devil and his host that have opposed God and all who have become a part of God’s organization; and the time for a final show’-down between the hosts of wickedness and God’s righteous organization is now at hand, and hence it is to bo expected that Jehovah -would give his faithful saints on earth a clearer vision of the matter than they have had at any previous time. It is certain that Satan and his host would long ago have destroyed all who have put themselves on the side of Jehovah, had not God exercised his power in behalf of those who love him; and thus he has held back’ the wicked ones, restraining them and preventing the destruction of his faithful witnesses. It was that same wicked crowd that persecuted Jesus when on earth and brought about his death, which Jehovah permitted; but at the same time he completely thwarted the purpose of the enemy by raising Jesus out of the death and giving him the highest place in his own great organization.—Phil. 2: 9-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“SONS OF GOD”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> In Jehovah’s universal organization there were many holy angels devoted to his service and \yho were never a part of Lucifer's company, and who did not participate with Lucifer in his rebellion. All of such faithful angels are the “sons of God”, because they received their life from Jehovah. (Job 38:7) Approximately 1,500 years had passed since the rebellion in Eden. Adam and Eve in that time had children and grandchildren, and the human race was continuously on the increase; and here begins the account concerning the debauchery of the human race. “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.” (Gen. 6:1, 2) It will be observed that the second verse above quoted says nothing about the wickedness of the angels, the “sons of God”, nor that such “sons of God” were wicked at the time they materialized as men. It could not be said that the ones here called “the sons of God” were any part of Satan’s organization at that time, if ever. All who had allied themselves with Satan the Devil were then, and arc, ‘the seed of Satan the Serpent,’ and hence the sons of Satan. This is proof that the ones here called the “sons of God” are entirely a different class or company from the ones that joined Satan in his rebellion. The fact that 1,500 years after the rebellion angels were called the “sons of God” shows that they had been all of that time serving Jehovah God. They were spirit creatures or angels having life from Jehovah God, and, continuing in his service, they arc designated as “the sons of God”,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> The chief objective of Satan from and after his rebellion w<sup>r</sup>as and has been and still is to turn all creation against Jehovah. There is nothing said in the record about the ones mentioned above as “the sons of God” as making any attempt to turn others away from Jehovah God. The Scriptures show that Satan is a sly, wily and seductive foe. Uis name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent </span><span class="font2">discloses that he is the arch deceiver amonest all creatures, and his name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Satan</span><span class="font2"> clearly means that he uses deception in his work of opposing Jehovah. We know that the Devil uses deception and fraud to entrap the human creatures who become negligent of their duty tow’ard God, and it is entirely reasonable that Satan employed a like manner of fraud and deceit in turning the spirit “sons of God” away from the Great or. It was a part of his wicked scheme to defraud angels as well as men and to induce them to go contrary to God's law. ‘The daughters of men were fair,’ and the “sons of God” saw these and observed that they were attractive. By fraud and deceit Satan first entrapped the beautiful Eve, which furnished Adam an excuse to join the Devil; and now’ 1,500 years thereafter he uses the beautiful daughters or granddaughters of Eve to entrap others, even the &quot;sons of God&quot;. Those angelic &quot;sons of God&quot; had power to materialize in a human organism, and doubtless did materialize. There is no evidence that by materializing they violated God’s law, because the Scriptures show that long after this, in the days of Abraham, angels materialized and appeared as men. (Gen. 19:1, 15; 18:1*15) While they did not materialize at the command of Jehovah, nor were they sent as his messengers, yet their sin docs not appear to be that of materialization. Appearing in human form they would necessarily be handsome end attractive men that would be pleasing to the women of that time. The Scriptures do not say that they were giants, and it would not bo at al) reasonable to conclude that they materialized as giants, but that they materialized as attractive men. &quot;The sons of God . . . took them wives of all which they chose.&quot; The result of this marital relationship between the &quot;sons of God&quot; and the daughters of meh resulted in greatly increased wickedness amongst the human race, and this of itself is conclusive proof that Satan was the prime mover in bringing about this condition.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WICKEDNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> Adam became a wicked man, and at the end of 1,500 years almost, all of the offspring of Adam had become wicked and brought reproach upon Jehovah’s name and vexed him. Abel, Enoch and Noah arc the only ones mentioned up to this time as having maintained their integrity toward God. It appears that probably all mankind had turned away from God at the time here mentioned, except Noah and the immediate members of his household. Noah had been on the earth for several hundred years; hence the account here in Genesis was &quot;in the days of Noah&quot;. The inference must be drawn that wickedness had continued to increase amongst men. &quot;And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.&quot; (Gen. 6: 3, d.R.V.) The words here used, &quot;Sly Spirit,&quot; mean Jehovah himself, that being another way of saying &quot;I the Spirit&quot;. If, however, the pronoun &quot;I&quot; had been used it would not have set oft' so forcefully the tremendous contrast between &quot;Spirit&quot; the Creatorand &quot;flesh&quot;, that is, human creatures. Jehovah is The Spirit, the Almighty; and man, being flesh, is vastly weaker and inferior to Jehovah. Since Adam had become a sinner, Jehovah had been striving with humankind, and very few of them had maintained their integrity toward God. It appeared that Satan was succeeding admirably in turning the human race away from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> The Hebrew for the English word &quot;strive” is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">doon</span><span class="font2"> and is a primitive root meaning &quot;to rule&quot;, and, by implication, &quot;to judge&quot; (as an umpire); also &quot;to strive&quot; or do as adversaries do at law or in litigation. During all those fifteen centuries Jehovah had been judging men as to their integrity. From Adam to Noah inclusive was ten generations of men, symbolic of earthly' completeness; and in all that time Noah was the third man, as the divine record discloses, to prove his integrity toward God, Abel and Enoch being the two other men. There was no need for Jehovah to prolong the controversy for ever as though man could continue to strive with his Creator and Judge in the same manner that he strives against an adversary at law. Since the time of Enos men had been ‘calling themselves by the name of the Lord’, but manifestly that was done for the purpose of bringing reproach upon God’s name, in the same manner as many men today call themselves Christians but openly bring reproach upon the name of God and Christ. It is cpiite evident that, since the marriage of the &quot;sons of God&quot; with the daughters of men, wickedness had increased, and hence the statement by the great Spirit. &quot;My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.&quot; Flesh or human creatures were not. holding integrity toward God. God’s announcement is, in effect, that flesh is not to forever insult the name of Jehovah. In contrast between Jehovah and creatures it is written: &quot;Now the Egyptians arc men, and not God,&quot; and they also are &quot;flesh, and not spirit&quot;. &quot;All flesh is grass.&quot; (Isa. 31:3; 40:6) Man could not therefore go on for ever mocking God the great Spirit. Provoking God shows that man did not have, the correct appreciation of what man is as compared with the great. Creator.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> The. presumption is that the fathers of the daughters consented to their daughters’ marrying the materialized spirit creatures, reasoning that such a course would make the human race great as compared with God and give them a belter standing with the Almighty. It would be the Devil that would instill just such a thought into the minds of men, his purpose being to mock God and bring reproach upon his name. Such a course of action was abominable in the sight of Jehovah, because it was gross wickedness. Says Jehovah through his prophet: “The grass witbereth, the flower fadeth: because the Spirit of the. Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. <sup>r</sup>”hc grass withcr-eth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.&quot;—Isa. 40:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> Why should Jehovah God, the Spirit, always strive with man and permit man to reproach his name? In substance God here says: ‘I am Spirit, and man is flesh; and I can instantly blot him out of existence; yet his days [of grace, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leescr]</span><span class="font2"> shall be one hundred and twenty years.’ This seems clearly to say, in substance, that for fifteen centuries man had been out of harmony with his Creator, yet now God would suffer or permit man to go on another one hundred and twenty years before he would bring about the destruction of the human race. That statement concerning the hundred and twenty years referred to wicked men, and not to Noah, because Noah, who was then alive and walking with God, continued to live, on earth for 350 years after the flood. Why, then, should God suffer sinful man with no integrity toward Jehovah to continue 120 years longer? Manifestly for the same reason that Jehovah permitted Pharaoh, as a special representative of the Devil himself, to remain for a time, and for the same reason that God has permitted the Devil to continue until now; that is to say, that ‘Jehovah might exhibit his power and cause a witness to be given in the earth to his name’. (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lee-' scr)</span><span class="font2"> It was during that 120 years that Jehovah did cause a great witness to be given to his name, and at the end of that 120 years he brought about the complete destruction of the world, which destruction foreshadows the destruction of the world at Armageddon. In this manner Jehovah shows that he had timed the destruction of the world by the flood of waters and that he would allow ample time before that destruction to serve notice on men and on their superhuman sons-in-law, the incarnated “sons of God”. In that day before the flood men lived for many years, and 120 years could easily lie allowed by the Lord before bringing upon the world the execution of his judgment and still inelude the generation then living at Ihe time of this expression of his determination to destroy the world. The 120 years here mentioned in no way whatsoever Axes the age limit of man, nor did the matter have anything to do with the length of time Moses Jived; but rather the 120 years here mentioned definitely fixed the time when God would bring the flood u[»on the earth. It appears from the record that the declaration of Jehovah concerning the 120 years of further grace was made before Noah was 500 years old and before he begat his three sons.—Gen. 6: 9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">It has been said that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nephilim</span><span class="font2"> in the earth were the same as the “mighty men” and that these were destroyed in the flood. There is no Scriptural support for such a conclusion. The scripture is definite that it was “the sons of God” that took them wives from the daughters of men, and this statement is conclusive proof that the nephilim were not the ones who married the daughters of men. The nephilim, being giants, would have been entirely out of proportion in size to have human creatures for wives. That the nephilim did materialize as human creatures there is no doubt, because the Scriptures say they were in the earth. Doubtless the nephilim were the very ones, together with Satan, who induced the “sons of God” to leave their proper place in the service of Jehovah and seek pleasure with the daughters of men, and this they did to turn those “sons of God” away from Jehovah that they might receive the disapproval of Jehovah and at the same time bring greater reproach upon his name. These “giants” or nephilim materialized and were on the earth, but “the sons of God” married the daughters of men, and this the reeord clearly shows, to wit: “There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men, which were of old, men of renown.” (Gen. 6: 4) It was after those giants first appeared on earth that the “sons of God” and the daughters of men had children, as shown by this text. These “giants” or nephilim were probably called “fallen ones” or ‘fallen angels’ because they had fallen entirely away from God, and for the further reason that they were “fellers” or ones who fell upon others and treated them in a tyrannical manner. According to a recognized authority, “nephilim” means those who fall (upon others), that is, “fellers.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong)</span><span class="font2"> Without a doubt Gog was among that crowd of wicked spirits or nephilim, and this lends support to the conclusion that Gog may yet materialize in human form and lead the visible forces of the Devil in an assault upon God’.sorganization._( </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 311) It is certain that the nephilim are not the same as the “sons of God” mentioned in the Genesis account, for at least two reasons: (1) they were on the earth before the materialization of the “sons of God”; and (2) these nephilim or giants were not the sons of God, but the seed or sons of 1hc Devil. Other scriptures hereinafter considered fully support this conclusion. By the marriage of the “sons of God” with the daughters of men, children were bom, and “the same became mighty men, which were of old, men of renown”. Those “men of renown”, the offspring of the “sons of God”, were not called nephilim, but arc termed, according to the Hebrew text, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gibborim.</span><span class="font2"> In the great deluge that came upon the earth the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gibborim</span><span class="font2"> or “mighty men” were destroyed, but there is no Scriptural evidence that either the “sons of God” or the nephilim, described in the Genesis account, were destroyed. On 'he contrary, the evidence shows that they are yet alive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> It may be suggested that there were nephilim on the earth after the flood, because the spies returning from Canaan reported that they saw giants </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(nephilim) : </span><span class="font2">“And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and wc were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so wc were in their sight.” (Num. 13: 33, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.li.</span><span class="font2">F.) But the answer to that is this: the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nephilim</span><span class="font2"> means “giants” or “tyrants”, and it is expressly stated in this scripture that the giants who were there seen were the sons of Anak (meaning “long-necked”; hence a giant). Anak was a human creature; but this could not refer to the same class of giants or nephilim as mentioned in the Genes's account. The nephilim who materialized on the earth before the flood are not said to be sons of any man, which, of course, they could not have been, since they were materialized spirits. The giants seen in Canaan were human creatures, and Caleb drove them out of Hebron.—Josh. 15:13. 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> The nephilim mentioned in the Genesis account were a part of the Devil’s organization that had operated with him since the rebellion. By materializing as human creatures they would induce the “sons of God”, mentioned in Genesis 6:2, who had up to that time been loyal to Jehovah, to materialize and to indulge in marital relationship with the daughters of men. These spirit creatures, “the sons of God,” having previously been in Jehovah’s service, now by taking human wives and having children by them thus left their proper service of Jehovah in heaven, proba-bty at the time not willfully intending to be disloyal to God, but being induced to believe that they could render a service to man and help him up and at the samp time do this to the glory of God. While the Genesis record is silent as to whether or not God prohibited them from marrying human wives, yet God’s law later on given to the Israelites shows that such a course was contrary to his will.—Lev. 19:19; 20:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> In Jude it is written: “The angels which kept not their first estate [principality, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">margin],</span><span class="font2"> but left their own habitation [their proper dwelling (place), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rath.], </span><span class="font2">he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.” (Jude 6) This scripture has heretofore been applied to the conduct of the “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:2; yet other scriptures relating thereto show that such a conclusion is not supported. The words of Jude clearly apply to the nephilim, and not to the “sons of God”, that is to say, to those giants that materialized on earth and who arc a part of Satan’s organization from the time of the rebellion. It is the nephilim that are included in the judgment of Jehovah for destruction, together with Satan, because they are Satan’s angels and are a part of his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> The mere fact that the “sons of God”, after they had materialized, intermarried with human women would not mean that they were directly a part of Satan’s organization or that they were even in sympathy with Satan’s organization. Satan and his allies, the nephilim, would cause these “sons of God” to indulge in false reasoning which led them into an unwise course, bringing them into difficulties like unto that mentioned by the apostle Paul concerning men who leave the service of God and take wives: “But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. So then, he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.” (1 Cor. 7: 33, 35, 38) “The sons of God” would not be at liberty to marry human wives, because that would take them away from God’s service, but, falling to the subtle influence and false reasoning of Satan, they doubtless adopted a line of reasoning like that of the “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9-17) or “prisoner” class (Isa. 42:6, 7; 49: 9; 61:1), who reason that they can mix with the world and at the same time serve God. Many men and women have consecrated their lives to God and have, contrary to his will, mixed up with the world, reasoning that they could do so and at the same time serve God and uplift the world; but such a course docs not result in uplifting the world and does no honor to Jehovah, and this same class he has designated as “ prisoners” because they are held in restraint by having mixed up with the world. (Ps. 79:11; 142: 7) Doubtless the “sons of God” were induced by Satan to reason along the same line; thus they were entrapped. In the days of Noah the human race was very wicked, even as there is now great wickedness upon the earth. The “prisoner” or “great multitude” class now reason that they can disregard God’s Word of truth and stay in the religious systems, which are a part of the Devil’s organization, and thus serve God and man. These are described by the Lord in Psalm 107:10-20. Satan, working through his earthly agents, is the one who gets the “great multitude” into this trap; and this supports the conclusion that it was Satan and his materialized allies or agents, the nephilim, that induced the “sons of God” to take the wrong course and fall into Satan’s trap.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> The children born to the human women and the “sons of God” are called in the Scriptures “mighty men” in the time of the old world before the flood. The same word is used to describe Nimrod, who was said to be a “mighty” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(gibbor,</span><span class="font2"> Hebrew; powerful) man before the Lord. (Gen. 10:8, 9) These offspring of the union of the daughters of men with the “sons of God” became “men of renown” amongst men, but clearly not before the Lord, for the reason that the Bible account has not preserved the names of any of these men of renown; hence they were not renowned before Jehovah. They had no integrity toward God, but were abominable in his sight, being both mongrels and monstrosities, who made names for themselves because of their wickedness. In like manner Nimrod became famous amongst men. That mongrel race, called “men of renown”, were not nephilim, as the record clearly shows, and, being mongrels and monstrosities, they could not produce their kind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>25</sup> The Genesis record docs not definitely mention the wickedness of the nephilim, for the manifest, reason they were desperately wicked from the time of the rebellion at Edon and were under judgment from that time forward. Be it also noted that the divine record does not mention the wickedness of the “sons of God” but does emphasize the wickedness of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">man.</span><span class="font2"> “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” (Gen. 6:5) Satan, following his fixed policy, had turned man away from God and had used men and their daughters to corrupt the “sons of God”, who for a long time had been loyal, and the ‘wickedness on the earth’ mentioned is specifically applied to man, and it was concerning man that the Lord said he would not longer strive with him. Jehovah cites this wickedness as a reason for his change of course of action toward men. It was the human race that the Devil had turned away from Jehovah, and now Satan executes his wicked scheme by using human creatures to entrap spirit creatures and turn them away from Jehovah and get them out of his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>26</sup> Because of this great wickedness amongst flesh creatures it is written: “And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.” (Gen. 6: 6) The Hebrew word here for “repent” is also translated as follows: “Be comforted, receive comfort, comfort, case (oneself).” For example, note the following scriptures: “Therefore raith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.” (Isa. 1:24) “Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in raj- zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.”—Ezck. 5: 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">” This does not mean that God regretted that he had made the earth and made man upon it. There would have been no necessity for regrets, because he eould have destroyed Satan and Adam at the very moment of the rebellion. Jehovah himself being wholly devoted to righteousness, it grieved him at heart that man had taken the wicked course; hence God's heart reeded to be eased or comforted and would receive it, not from what some creature might do, but from his own course of action toward those who had brought reproach upon his name. Il is decision was to avenge er vindicate his name, and this he would do by the destruction of those who had united with Satan's organization and had willfully reproached his name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2S</sup> Satan and his wicked allies had misused and perverted the lower animals of the earth, instilling in them the devilish spirit, and God declared his purpose to destroy both man and beast. “And the Lord said, I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the ait; for it repenteth me that I have made them.”—Gen. 6:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup>The words “destroy” and “created” here used arc in complete contrast and disclose the meaning of God’s repentance, that is to say, that God the Creator, who had extended his loving kindness toward his creatures, now turned to Destroyer of both man and beast that had been turned by the Devil into wickedness. Thus God ehang, d his course, or repented, the word “repented” meaning “to change his course of action”. Be it noted that no mention is here made of the nephi-lim or of the “sons of God”, which shows that their case is to be dealt with by Jehovah elsewhere. That which is here said with reference to destruction applies to the things on the earth, and Noah was the exception. “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.” (Gen. 6:8) If the word “repented”, as here used, means that God had made a mistake in making man, then why preserve Noah? Jehovah here shows that his purpose is ultimately to destroy all the willfully wicked, and shows that his favor is given only to those who are obedient to him. “Surely he scorneth the scorncrs; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.” (Prov. 3:34) “Be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.” —1 Pet. 5:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>30</sup> God having decreed according to the Genesis account that 120 years should elapse before he would destroy the creation on earth, and Noah having obtained favor in God’s sight, God then gave to Noah a good woman for a wife, and during the last 100 years before the .flood she bore Noah three sons. “The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.”—Gen. 6:8-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>31</sup> Men on earth, with the exception of Noah and his household, were extremely wicked, corrupt, and filled the earth with violence, which condition was hateful to God. “Him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.” (Ps. 11.-5; Ezek. 7:10, 11; 8:17) Note that the text says: “All flesh has corrupted his way upon the earth.” This does not say, nor does it mean, that man had corrupted his nature, but his way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>32</sup> The time having come for God to execute his vengeance upon the wicked ones, he made Noah his witness and directed him to hear testimony to others, and this foreshadowed how God at the present time sends forth his anointed to bear witness to his name and his purpose before he brings destruction upon Satan’s organization. The fact that God did not even mention the ncpliilim and the “sons of God” in this decree of destruction, but confined it to “all flesh”, shows that man himself is responsible for his wicked course willfully taken. “z\nd God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and, behold, 1 will destroy them with the earth.” (Gen. 6:13) This would bring an end to the long period of Jehovah's striving with humankind. Jehovah then instructed Noah to build the ark, and, as it is written, “by faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet [such as rain, waterspouts, or storms), moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house: through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.” (Ileb. 11:7, zl./f.P.) The building of the ark displayed Noah’s faith, and hence condemned the world. The construction of the ark was a powerful form of preaching or bearing testimony; but Noah would also explain to those people about him why he was building the ark, and thus he would bear testimony by word of mouth. Therefore the human family and the “sons of God”, as well as their offspring, would thus be the recipients of Noah’s testimony, and by this means Noah was made a ‘theater for both men and angels’, even as Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth are witnesses both to the unseen and to the seen ones concerning God’s purpose to destroy the world at Armageddon. (1 Cor. 4:9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font2"> The carrying of Noah over the flood, and his delivery thereafter, was like the resurrection from the dead, and that was a forceful sermon to the angels concerning Jehovah’s power. Thus by the ark and by Noah and the flood Jehovah displayed his power before creation and caused his name to be made known throughout the world. Even so now God has commanded his faithful witnesses to bear testimony to his name and that God will by and through his kingdom completely vindicate his name in the destruction of everything and every creature that opposes his purpose and reproaches his holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>83</sup> The Scriptural proof therefore clearly shows a distinction between the “nephilim” and the “sons of God” which later married human wives. Also that the “men of renown”, the offspring of this union of materialized spirits with daughters of men, are clearly distinct from both nephilim and “sons of God”. There would be no reason to keep alive these monstrosities, and they were destroyed in the flood.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup>* The question, then, is, What became of these “sons of God” at the time of the flood, and what is their present condition? And what relationship, if any, do they bear to the violence now on the earth? The elear statement of the apostle in Ephesians 6:12 is that the ones making war upon the saints consist of a host of spiritual wicked ones. Is it the nephilim or these “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis, one or both classes, that are associated with Satan in their opposition to Jehovah’s anointed?</span></p>

What are some of the questions that here call for further consideration of this subject!</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>RESURRECTION AND SIN-OFFERING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">E</span><span class="font2">ARLY Sunday, the first day of the week, the morning of Jesus’ resurrection, Mary Magdalene saw him near the sepulcher, “and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?” (John 20 ■. 14-17) Mary on this occasion thought that he was the gardener, until she heard the sound of his familiar voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the same morning the women returning from the sepulcher saw the Master. The apostle Matthew (28: 9,10) says: “And as they went to tell his disciples [what the angel at the sepulcher had said], behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Simon Peter, the apostle, saw Jesus on the same day near Jerusalem. (Luke 24: 34) On this same Sunday morning, while walking to Emmaus, two of the disciples were overtaken by Jesus; and ho journeyed with them and they did not recognize him until he sat with them to eat and blessed the food in his familiar way.—Luke 24: 13-21, 30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the evening of the same Sunday, near Jerusalem, ten of the disciples saw him.—John 20: 19-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thereafter he again appeared to the disciples at Jerusalem, when Thomas was with them. This was one week after his resurrection.—John 20: 23-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few days later, while seven of his disciples were fishing in the sea of Galilee he appeared to them and held conversation with them.—John 21: 1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few days later he appeared to the eleven on a mountain near Galilee.—Matt. 28: 16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A^ain he appeared to a company of more than five hundred gathered together by appointment in Galilee. —1 Cor. 15: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On another occasion James saw him alone.—1 Cor. 15: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His last appearance was on the Mount of Olives, to his disciples, at the time of his ascension.—Acts 1: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saul of the city of Tarsus had opposed the Lord and persecuted him. Bent on the slaughter of the disciples of the Lord, Saul was on his journey to Damascus, when suddenly there shone about him a light more brilliant than the sun at noonday. This was a manifestation of the Lord in his resurrected glory. On this occasion the Lord spoke to Saul and said to him: “I am Jesus, whom thou persecutcst.” (Acts 9:1-9) Afterwards Saul of Tarsus was called Paul. He accepted the Lord, was begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, and became a special minister of Christ, clothed with power and authority to speak the Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Writing concerning the Master, Jesus of Nazareth, the apostle Paul said: “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he arose again the third day according to the scriptures; and that he was seen of Cephas [the apostle Peter), then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some arc fallen asleep. After that; he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.”—1 Cor. 15: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then Paul sets forth an argument clear and convincing, concerning the resurrection of the Lord, in which he proves that Jesus was raised from the dead, that his resurrection was necessary, and that unless he was raised from the dead there is no hope for the human family. But with positiveness he asserts ‘Christ has been raised from the dead and has become the firstfruits of them that slept’, and that the resurrection of Christ Jesus was a guarantee that in God’s due time he would resurrect others who have died.— 1 Cor. 15: 12-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again Paul wrote that God has appointed a day for the judgment of the world, and that he has given assurance of that time, in that he raised up Christ Jesus from the dead.—Acts 17: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The beloved apostle John, faithful and true to the Lord to the end, under inspiration wrote this concerning the Lord Jesus: “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.”—1 John 1: 1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ is proved so cogently and convincingly by the Scriptures that there cannot remain a doubt in the mind of anyone who believes that the Bible was written as the Word of God. The Lord’s resurrection has an important relationship with the great sin-offering for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The value of Jesus’ perfect human life laid down at the tree on Calvary, but the right to which life survived, constituted the purchase or ransom price which we call merit. Jesus died upon the tree, but his right to live was not taken away. There is a vast difference between living and having the right to live. Adam the first man had the right to live, but he sinned. Immediately after God’s judgment was entered against him his right to life was gone, yet he survived for nine hundred and thirty years. Jesus actually died on the tree; but, he dying as a voluntary sacrifice, his right to life did not perish, but survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was Adam’s commission of sin that caused God to sentence him to death. If Adam or any of his race were ever to be released it must be after the offering for sin is made, which offering must be the ransom price, namely, the merit or valuable thing or right to a perfect human life. This offering must be made in heaven. Therefore, in order for Jesus to present his sin-offering he must be raised from the dead a spirit creature and appear in the presence of God in heaven itself and there present the value of his sacrifice at the court of sentence.—Ileb. 9: 20-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The proof is conclusive that Jesus was made flesh and dwelt amongst men; that he suffered death in order that he might provide the redemptive price for men; that God raised him out of death a divine creature and exalted him to a position above all others in the universe, God alone excepted. On this point the sacred record says: “[He], though being in God’s form, yet did not meditate a usurpation to be like God, but divested himself, taking a bondman's form, having been made in the likeness of men; and being in condition as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. And therefore God supremely exalted him, and freely granted to him that name which is above every name; in order that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those beneath ; and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.”— Phil. 2: 6-11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now we can understand the living picture made when Abraham the Hebrew offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah. There Abraham was a type or prophetic picture of Jehovah God. Isaac, the only son of Abraham, was a type of Jesus, the beloved and only begotten Son of Jehovah. Abraham went as far as possible in offering his son as a living sacrifice without actually taking his life. But the picture was sufficient to show that God would offer his beloved Son a living sacrifice, and this was the lesson that Jeliovah • purposed to teach. At the moment when Abraham’s hand was descending with a knife to strike dead his son, God stopped him and through his angel spoke to Abraham. “And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withhold thy son, thine only son, from me.”—Gen. 22: 11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then and there God gave to Abraham that promise in which all mankind is vitally interested, because it foretells the coining of the great Deliverer of mankind through whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. We read that God added: “By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.”—Gen. 22: 16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again, the death of Jesus was foreshadowed in the passover which God instituted among the Jews while in Egypt. (Ex. 12: 1-12) A lamb was taken up into each Jewish house on the tenth day of the month Nisan, which lamb must be without spot or blemish. On the fourteenth day of that same month the lamb must be slain and the blood sprinkled upon the door posts, which was a sign of protection for the firstborn of the family inside that house and which was a provision precedent to the deliverance of all the Israelites out of Egypt. The antitype or real fulfilment of that lamb was Jesus, as it is written: “The next day John [the Baptist] sccth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1: 29) Testimony to the same effect is found in the book of Revelation (5: 6), where the apostle John says: “And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne [of God] and of the four beasts [round about], and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.”—Rev. 5: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this last quoted scripture the number seven is a symbol of completeness; horns a symbol of complete power; the eyes a symbol of complete wisdom; thus testifying that the great antitypical Lamb of God would bo clothed with perfect wisdom and all power and authority to carry out the divine purpose; an I this is exactly what the Scriptures show was granted unto Jesus. After his resurrection from the dead and before his ascension to heaven Jesus said: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.”—Matt. 28:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lamb that was taken up to be offered for the passover of the Jews “shall [so the divine instructions stated] be without blemish, a male of the first year”. (Ex. 12: 5) Writing concerning the redemptive price provided by the blood of Jesus, the apostle Peter, under inspiration, says: “With the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”—1 Pet. 1: 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus, being the antitypical paschal Lamb, must offer himself to the Jews on the tenth day of Nisan. It was on the tenth day of Nisan that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the ass and offered himself to the Jews as their King. (Matt. 21: 1-9) lie must die on the fourteenth day of Nisan in order to fulfil the type, and it was on the fourteenth day of Nisan that he was nailed on the tree.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>EXALTING JEHOVAH’S NAME</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">HOUGH unseen by human eyes, Jehovah, the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, is now becoming more fully known through the wonderful works which he.is performing for the information and encouragement of those who trust in him. Songs of praise, therefore, are very much in order; and such praise to Jehovah is today rising from among the gathered witnesses of Jehovah, who throughout all the earth declare among the people Jehovah’s name and the good news of his kingdom, the only hope of the world.—Matt. 12:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah God has provided music for the new-born government and his faithful witnesses who delight to sing that musie. The Psalms of the Bible are poems set to music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of these kingdom poems is Psalm 99. It opens with the statement that Jehovah has become King and calls upon the people to tremble. “Jehovah [at this particular time] is great in Zion [his organization] ; . . . Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. . . . Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.” Uis name is exalted by a great public proclamation. “His footstool” mentioned herein is his temple class on earth, for there the Lord God is represented on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Verse 6 of this psalm speaks of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel as calling upon the Lord and being heard by him, and his answering them. This is evidently here inserted as an encouragement to those who today call upon the name of Jehovah and trust him implicitly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another one of these government songs is Psalm 68. It opens with the statement: ‘ ‘ Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.” Representatively Jehovah arose in the representative capacity of the Melehizedek priesthood. Christ, the great High Priest after the order of Melehizedek, stands up from his scat to make his enemy his footstool, and those on earth who are devoted to Jehovah are willing volunteers in this day. (Ps. 110:3) “Sing unto God, sing praises to his name; extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, ami rejoice before him.” God is not so much concerned about hearing the singing for himself, but to have the people hear it, that his name might l&gt;e exalted. Therefore this must be by a public witness to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is written that when the ark of the covenant was set forward on its journey toward the Promised Land these identical words with which the psalmist opened were spoken: “Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered.” (Num. 10:35) When David carried the ark to its resting place on Mount Zion this custom must have been followed. It is recorded that on this occasion David caused to be appointed singers with instruments of music. (1 Chron. 15:16-28) With song and instrumental musie the ark was brought forward and placed on Mount Zion. This was done in the presence of the enemies. That service pictured what is now going on in the earth. The song of the kingdom now says: “They have seen thy goings, 0 God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.” (Ps. 6S:24) Thus the enemy sees the work going on and hears the remnant singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another song of the new government is Psalm 149. The song opens with: “Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song (in view of the fact that his kingdom has come], and his praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King,” because the King of glory is come. “Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds.” The Lord has been glorified as King, and the honor attaches to his remnant as ambassadors of the new King, and therefore they are in glory. They sing upon their beds instead of going to sleep, as some have. They arc active in showing forth the praises of the Lord day and night and will continue until earthly sleep overtakes them. This is in exact harmony with the words of God’s prophet in Isaiah 62:6,7, in which the Lord says his watchmen shall not hold their peace day or night but shall continue to make mention of the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand.” God is their Creator and is worthy to be praised. The “sword in their hand” shows that these faithful ones are engaged in a warfare against Satan’s seed.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“To execute vengeance upon the [nations], and punishments upon the people.” The “sword” with which they are to execute this vengeance is the Word of God. (Eph. 6:17) The method of execution is simply by declaring what the Word of God has to say concerning his vengeance and the expression thereof against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron.” Manifestly it is the kings of “Christendom” that are referred to here as being bound. The faithful remnant class use the Word of God to bind these kings and nobles. “The rod of the wicked shall not [longer] rest upon the lot of the righteous.” (Ps. 125:3) The proclamation of the truth and the hearing of it by the people is destroying the influence of the “nobles”, namely, the clergy, over the people. Men are getting their eyes open and are getting away from standing in fear of these ecclesiastical “nobles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“To execute upon them the judgment written.” This shows that-the remnant class arc to follow what is written and are only to proclaim the message of God's kingdom. It is not for them to do any violence to the rulers or the nobles, but to declare the judgment which the Lord God has already decreed against them and which is written in his Word. They are therefore merely the servers of notice as to what shall be done. The song concludes: “This honour have all his saints.” The Lord counts theirs an honorable work. Those who fail and refuse to joyfully have a part in performing this work of testimony to the great name of Jehovah are by the terms of the psalm excluded from the saintly class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another one of these kingdom songs is Psalm 72. “Give the king [The Stone, Christ Jesus, God’s Anointed King] thy judgments [thy decrees and authority to execute them], 0 God, and thy righteousness [‘the robe of righteousness’] unto the king’s son [Jehovah’s royal sons still on the earth], lie [Christ Jesus, having been given God’s judgments and authority] shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.” This song is another evidence as to what must now be done as a part of God’s great work in the earth and which must be done by the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another one of the new government songs is Psalm 95, which the remnant class are now singing: “0 come, let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.” The reason for this song is that Jehovah is the great God and is now exalted in Zion. Irf 1914 the earth became the Lord’s, and he sent forth his Anointed One to oust the ruler thereof. Therefore “in his hand are the deep places of the earth”. God through his prophet Ezekiel had promised that he would search out his sheep and call them, and that he would shepherd his flock and deliver them out of places where they have been scattered. (Ezek. 34; 11,12) Recognizing that the Lord God has done this, the remnant sing: “For he is our God; and we arc the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostle Paul applies this psalm to the close of the age of God’s favor to natural Israel; and, according to the rule laid down by him, it applies with greater force to the end of the world when God is gathering his people to himself, (lleb. 3:15-19; 4:1-3; 1 Cor. 10:11) Since the coming of the Lord to his temple, and the lieginning of judgment throughout the house of God, the Lord’s voice thus speaks out to the. temple class that their hearts may not be hardened but that they may rejoice to obey his Word. The Lord says that some of those anointed to kingship will harden their hearts and will turn away and will not engage in the glad song announcing his kingdom. These will complain against their brethren and insist that there is nothing to be done but to await the time when they shall lie taken to the kingdom. The Lord rep-restnfsthc faithful remnant class, however, as singing: “And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that seng but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”—Rev. 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The complaincrs cannot understand this song because they refuse to participate in it. Those who have already passed into glory and are for ever with the Lord engage in the singing of the new song declaring the praises of Jehovah. The remnant still on earth participate in the singing of these songs that constitute the music of the new government. The fact that the statement is made that no man on earth can learn that song except the 144,000 shows that those of the remnant elass still on earth would know and participate in the song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another of the new government songs addressed to the “Chief Musician” is Psalm 66. “Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands.” This joyful noise must be made amongst the nations as a witness and must be given as the Lord commanded by those who love the good tidings and who are the faithful witnesses of the Lord. The song continues: “Sing forth the honour of his name; make his praise glorious.” In the centuries past God has magnified his Word of promise. Now the time has come when his name must be exalted in the earth; and his faithful witnesses, whom he has appointed, are privileged thus to magnify it, by telling forth to those who will hear that his righteous government is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the new government music which the remnant class sing is Psalm 75. “Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks :,for that thy name is near, thy ■wondrous works declare.” (Ps. 75:1) Jehovah is now doing his works in the earth. These things seen by the anointed servants are evidences to them that God himself is near and is taking a hand in the affairs of the earth. Some works he must do by forces other than his people on earth. Almost all his work on earth done by the anointed is the making proclamation to the honor of his name. Opportunities that they have now to serve him in declaring his name are proof to the anointed that God is using them, and that therefore they have his approval. Such is further proof that now is God's due time to have his name declared in the earth. With a clearer vision of God's purposes concerning them, ■ the anointed can go on in his work with full confidence. They are not so much concerned about how long they must continue to work on earth, nor how great the danger of attack from the enemy; but they arc concerned about faithfulness to their covenant. With serenity they sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some who are anointed think they should not speak against the Devil’s organization but should be at peace with it. Sueh are fickle, because they cannot pursue that course and be loyal and faithful unto the Lord. To the anointed ones the Lord says: “My son, fear thou the Lord and the king [God’s Anointed One, the Stone laid in Zion] ; and meddle not [associate not] with them that are given to change [that are fickle].” These who turn aside to associate with the workers of iniquity shall fall. “As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace shall be upon [spiritual] Israel.”—Ps. 125:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Only those who arc faithful to the Lord shall stand. That one is of the remnant class now is no guarantee that he is going to be of that elass finally. He must continue diligent and faithful even unto the end. “Seest thou a man diligent in his business [that is, the King’s business, looking after the kingdom interests] ? he shall stand [face to face] before [the] kings [.Jehovah and Christ Jesus] ; he shall not stand before mean [or obscure] men [the petty kings of earth; he will not have the approval of such].” (Prov. 22:29) Those who are faithful and so continue unto the end, and are diligent in proclaiming the praises of the name of the Lord, shall have the friendship of God's Anointed King. ‘lie that hath pureness of heart, and grace upon his lips, shall have the King for his friend.’— Prov. 22:11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The marvelous work of Jehovah progresses and his people look forward with confidence to the time when his righteous government shall be completely established in the earth, solely in charge of earth’s affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NOAH DOES WELL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A foreign-speaking director told me that when he waa in the Greek army his commander said, “When you see a Turk, don’t hunt me up for advice. Shoot the Turk.’’ I made immediate use of the opportunity Jehovah furnished through ids servant our president by carrying a set of the new records and a port* able phonograph with me each Sunday on our service work, trying to find one sincere seeker of truth and then letting you answer his questions. 1 rejoice to tell you your efforts along tlus line have already been amply repaid and a now and wonderful opportunity for service opened. It is a real time-saver to a worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first Sunday, an elderly gentleman, after the usual card testimony, being<sup>-</sup> penniless, expressed gratitude for charitable gifts of booklets, etc., he had received from time to time from our witnesses, and said, “ Now tell me your latest news on Armageddon.’’ I played the lecture on that subject to him and a roomful of relatives, it being a short distance back to my car and the phonograph. At the conclusion, with tears running down onto Ids snowy beard, he said, “Young man, that’s the most forceful lecturer I have ever heard, and he has told me more on that little record than I have heard from preachers in seventy years.’’ With expressions of joy he followed me to the gate and asked God’s blessing on the work for the peace it had given him. If you had seen the expression on that old fellow’s face!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each Sunday, in addition to week-day use, I have taken your lectures along in the car, hoping at least one person will stop me to ask questions. Each Sunday such an incident has occurred, and the total time required to really explain a subject is never more than ten minutes. I have noted many workers spend 5-10-20 minutes in fruitless lecturing at a door, often leaving the people more confused than ever. In my opinion (and I voice that of every listener to date) those lectures are the most pungent pieces of information on the subjects ever prepared. The only objection I have heard is from our own workers who apparently desire to hear their own voice set forth the information in their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Eor such effort, richly blessed, I have been severely censured. I am told, “You should not use the records during the work period. L'se the card and then talk to the peojde, if they seem interested.’’ Personally, I prefer to let my superior do my talking when 1 secure an open door. You furnished me with a tool, and I will surely use it, especially when it seems particularly fitting and potent. I am told, “W’ait until the Society tells you how to use them.’’ (Three people, three Kundays would have missed the blessing.) I prefer to shoot the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Turk </span><span class="font1">on sight, and will do my best to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aim straight</span><span class="font1"> until my commander secs fit to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">better direct my fire.</span><span class="font1"> If I am wrong, 1 trust the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> straightens this out.</span></p>

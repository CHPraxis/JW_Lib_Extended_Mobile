<p><span class="font4">With an Appendix by Dr. E. Bedford (Calif orni</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">By Dr. G. C. Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">F WE were to believe the extremists—those who carry the food idea beyond the realm of reason and common sense—we should be forced to conclude that human life is maintained, not because of taking food, but in spite of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that the human body is the most wonderful piece of mechanism in the world. It can withstand danger from without and damage from within because of its peculiar power to right itself and restore its own fine balances. No machine ever made by the hand of man can do this. No machine can repair its own broken or damaged parts; but the body does this, through the medium of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These three sources supply the “raw material” from which our bones, blood, brain and brawn are made. If these are not replenished and rebuilt (if the waste is not made good), if the source and quality of supply does not equal the extent of damage, we become sick and diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The processes of repair and replacement of waste and damaged bodily tissue are the processes of changing air, water and food into living cells, and are known as oxidization, digestion and assimilation. We must grant that the supply of air and water is nearly uniform in quality. These elements are abundant everywhere, and of such quality that the system finds no difficulty in absorbing their virtues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is therefore a most logical conclusion that in practically every case and condition of sickness and disease, digestion or assimilation are at fault, the eliminative functions being considered subjective to proper digestion and assimilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And if we make digestion and assimilation prompt and easy, we shall have succeeded in removing the most general contributing cause of all bodily ailments. That this can be accom-</span><span class="font4">a) </span><span class="font6">plished has been proved in thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has until very recently been a generally accepted theory that plain and simple foods were best suited to the nourishment of the body and the sustenance of life. But the nutritive value of food does not lie in its plainness, nor yet in its simplicity, as is proved very decisively by chemical analysis of foods and the result of extended study and observation on the part of eminent food specialists. It is further true that the findings of these experts do not always agree in detail; but, in the main, there have been certain facts that all can safely agree upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The food question is still in its infancy and we may look for wonderful results from its proper application within the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, food is digested and assimilated and the nutriment is absorbed from it when taken in kind and combination with other foods which agree with it and will digest with it. The idea of loading up the stomach with eatables that merely excite one’s appetite and taste good is exactly as ridiculous as trying to develop steam in an engine by filling the fire-chamber with paper. The fact that paper is inflammable does not prove that it will burn properly or give off heat units in sufficient quantity and quality to make it a proper fuel for a locomotive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And food that “fills you up” and gives you a sense of stomach satisfaction is not necessarily the food that really furnishes nourishment for your nerves, muscles, brain and bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We believe that all foods that are nourishing and supply the elements necessary to life are right and good in their place. We do not condemn a single one of them. But it is the object of this treatise on food selection to teach the relative and combined values of different foods —and for this purpose the text is divided into lessons or chapters which will follow in order of their importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Give them your best attention, abide by these truths for at least one month, and we believe you will be firmly and for ever converted to the gospel of proper food selection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Digestibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the normal stomach, some foods digest readily; some do not. Some foods will be digested and ready for the processes of assimilation in one hour; others require four or five hours. Now, if two foods, one digestible in one hour and the other in four hours, are taken into the stomach at the same time, the first being digested will lie in the stomach for the remaining three hours until the latter is ready for assimilation. As a result of this delay, the first food putrefies (becomes decomposed) and its nutritive elements are so changed that, instead of being a proper substance for bodily replenishment, it becomes charged with ferments and toxins (poison).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For this reason, care should be taken to eat foods which may be digested in about the same length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the following list, the letter preceding each of these foods denotes the class of food to which it belongs. It is true that most of the foods belong to more than one class; that is, they contain elements found in several divisions of foods. However, this list takes into consideration the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">principal</span><span class="font6"> division to which they belong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">F designates that the food is considered a “Fat”, and that it is abundant in fat-producing elements. Fats are heat-producers and furnish the elements which supply heat and warmth to the body. Fats are mainly carbonates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">P designates that the food is considered a “Proteid”, or muscle-building food. These foods arc principally nitrates, being rich in nitrogen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">C designates that the food is considered a “Carbohydrate”, or one in which either starches or sugars are more than usually abundant. The carbohydrates include practically all the vegetables ordinarily used for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A designates that the food is considered an “Acid food”, or one supplying acids. The fruits make up this class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Few Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have endeavored to keep the following rules and suggestions in as few words as possible, but the subject is so broad and important that we have not been inclined to sacrifice clearness for brevity. We believe it will pay you well to give your most careful attention to the following paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So many kinds of food are usually taken at one meal that it is impossible to tell which one disagrees. In fact, it is usually the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">combination</span><span class="font6"> or mixture that disagrees, rather than any item of food. Articles of food that would agree perfectly well, taken separately, will produce acute dyspepsia when mixed together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For this reason a great many moderate and careful eaters are surprised to find along in middle age that theii’ stomachs are “going back on them”. A normal healthy stomach will stand a lot of abuse and misuse, but when these errors are kept up for years, there comes a time when the stomach is bound to rebel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Carr says: ‘Do not eat many things at one meal. Make each meal slightly different from the preceding one. Avoid sameness in diet, but court frugality. Many kinds of food introduced into the stomach at one time are sure to be harmful. Many foods are incompatible with others. Taken singly they are wholesome and easily digested. Taken together they disturb the stomach and poison the body. Two or three kinds of food at one meal are enough. Fewer would be better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Leon Patrick, M.D., says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Most of us are feeding wrongly. We take the wrong articles of diet. We eattoo much. We eat when there is no need for food, and often in the wrong way; and the consequence is that we are a disease-ridden people, and are likely to remain so until our ignorance and our sin of gluttony are removed. If we desire to be really healthy, all luxurious living and gluttony must go, and these must be replaced by simplicity of life in all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As a man eats and digests his food, so is he. Biologically considered, man is nothing but a stomach with its appendages—an organized group of organs clustered about his food tube.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The doctrine that food and dietetic habits are the chief factors in health and disease is not new, having been taught by Plato, 400 B.C. However, the feeding problem has only recently received the scientific consideration which it so justly deserves. Every modern physician considers it his business to understand, as much as possible, all food, not as a faddist, nor as a fanatic, but as a rational creature able to render the greatest good to the greatest number.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have long since known that it is not what we </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">eat,</span><span class="font6"> but what we </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">digest</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">assimilate,</span><span class="font6"> that gives us life with the power to be and to do. But in order to assure proper digestion and assimilation it is imperative that we, as thinking individuals, shall mix a little gray matter with our food. That is to say, we must become informed (for few of us already know) as to what foods are compatible and what foods are not. Foods are simply organized chemical elements, and when properly combined all is harmonious, but when haphazardly indulged in they are destined to undergo decomposition and fermentation, the sequel of which is auto-intoxication in its various manifestations, such as nervousness, headache, neuralgia, emaciation, rheumatism and scores of other diseases that for years past have been charged to other causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever since we could comprehend the utterances of a kind parent we have been wisely admonished not to eat between meals, while, much to our physical and mental undoing, the haphazard mixing of foods was markedly encouraged, due to an erroneous idea as to the importance of variety.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Variety Not Necessary</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is usually thought desirable and necessary that a great variety be furnished, in order that the appetite be satisfied and the needs of the body economy met. This misapprehension has arisen from the quite universal custom of eating the wrong combinations of foods, and foods which are deficient in nutritive properties. When a simple combination of not more than three or four articles of wholesome food is eaten, the appetite will be stimulated and the nutrition of the body greatly improved. Moreover, it assures certainty of digestion and gives nature a chance to show herself in the beauty of vigorous health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a physiologic fact that man can eat anything a good deal better than he can eat everything. The eminent physiologist, Pavlow, has conclusively proved that, in order to undergo digestion, each food must receive its specific digesting ferment. This fact logically accounts for the digestive confusion that takes place when a conglomerate mixture of food is ingested. The system is quite able to adapt itself to and digest a simple compatible combination, but it never has been and never will be able to effectively handle the ordinary, unmasticated meal to which has been added ice-water, tea, coffee, beer, or wine, instead of the natural digestive fluids of the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In truth, life is maimed, and but half what it might be, solely on account of preventable sickness and disease. Sound health means living by knowledge, not by chance. To be sick is to acknowledge to the world that you have not been living right. Your daily mistakes in eating have overbalanced the inherent tendency of your body to be ■well.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Agreeable Combinations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Meat and non-cooked starchy vegetables and green salads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Potatoes, baked or boiled in skins, may be eaten at the beginning of a meat meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eggs with toast, milk, sweet fruits, vegetables. Milk with eggs, nuts, grains, sweet fruits. Nuts with grains, vegetables, sweet fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Grains with milk, nuts, vegetables, sweet fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Vegetables with eggs, nuts, grains, sweet fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acid fruits with sweet fruits, cheese (cottage cheese especially), nuts, fats (oils), sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sweet fruits with acid fruits, milk, nuts, grains, eggs, fats or oils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acid foods should not be eaten with any other food whatever, unless it be cheese (cottage cheese preferred). Acid fruits and starchy foods (bread, cake, potatoes, rice, etc.) are especially incompatible and harmful. This combination almost invariably leads to fermentation. The acid fruits are lemons, grapefruit, oranges, apples, etc. The mild acid fruits, such as pears, peaches, plums, etc., are also best not combined with other foods, especially starches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tomatoes are in the same class with acid fruits and should not be eaten with starchy foods. Cooked tomatoes are more objectionable than raw ones. Tomatoes with spaghetti, rice, etc., cause fermentation. Even tomato soup should be barred from a mixed meal. All soups, in fact, should be eaten sparingly, except cream of vegetable soups or vegetable purees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sweet fruits, such as prunes, dates, figs, raisins, may be eaten with starchy foods; rice and raisins, for instance, make a dish that will agree with almost anyone, if not combined with other things. Figs, dates and prunes may be eaten with breakfast foods with cream. (See remarks on breakfast foods elsewhere.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>No Meat with Starchy Foods</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Meats should not be combined with starchy foods. On this point all authorities agree, notwithstanding our national dinner consists of bread, meat and potatoes. The reason why meat and starch are incompatible is this: Starches are digested with the acid of saliva and juices of the intestines. They are not acted upon in the stomach at all. Meats, on the other hand, are digested by the gastric juices in the stomach. Now, if meat and starch are eaten together, as soon as the meat enters, the gastric juice pours out to digest it, and at the same time prevents the digestion of the starch. The starch, therefore, instead of being digested, ferments, causing acidity and fermentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most compatible starchy food that can be taken with meat is potatoes (baked or boiled in their skins). If the potatoes are eaten before the meat, well masticated, little trouble will result, as the starch of the potato will be well started on digestion before the meat enters the stomach. The habit of taking a mouthful of bread, then one of meat, and then one of potato is a harmful one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next best starchy food that may be eaten with meat is whole-wheat bread, well baked, and stale if possible. Make a meal out of these two things only, and probably little harm would result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When meat is eaten (see paragraph on excessive meat-eating) the ideal combination or meal would be meat, two non-starchy vegetables, and a green salad (lettuce with tomatoes, cucumber or lettuce, or any three of these dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a very little salt). This should be the heaviest meal of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two starches are not necessary, and should not be eaten at the same meal. If two are eaten together, like bread and potato, or bread and rice, nature will show a preference and digest one while the other ferments. Two starchy foods at one meal also leads to an excess of these foods: a thing to be avoided. The same applies to meat: one only should be eaten at a meal. Simplicity of diet should always be aimed at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Non-starchy vegetables are turnips, carrots, cauliflower, beets, cabbage, onions, summer squash, parsnips, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, green peas, string beans, celery, asparagus, corn on the cob, kale, salsify, endive, eggplant, dandelion, and all kinds of greens.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Breakfast Foods</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Most people eat too much of breakfast foods. Mushy foods are especially objectionable. They are usually not cooked enough. (Rolled oats, cracked wheat, etc., should be cooked at least two hours.) And most people swallow them without chewing or mixing them with saliva. This leads to fermentation. Sugar taken with them hastens fermentation very much. Oatmeal (especially half-cooked, as usually served) taken with cream or milk and sugar is about the worst combination that a dyspeptic could eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The dry ready-baked breakfast foods are not so objectionable, especially if eaten dry or with very little cream, and well masticated. We consider Grape Nuts the best of the breakfast foods, as they are well dextrinized and must be chewed in order to be swallowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rice is one of the most easily digested of all foods, requiring only one hour for digestion. When well cooked with raisins, and eaten with butter or cream, it is a delicious food. For sedentary workers this dish is all that should be required for lunch. The unpolished rice is best, and should be used if it can be obtained.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Tea and Coffee</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Coffee and tea are stimulants which work like a whip applied to a horse, in not giving strength, but pushing us on to greater effort. They may be allowed to people of sluggish temperament, for whom they lift up, temporarily, the nervous energy to normal. Those suffering from stomach, heart, kidney, and nervous troubles should avoid coffee and tea, as, by stimulating the organs to quicker action, they produce hyperacidity of the stomach, palpitation of the heart, an increased flow of urine, and an exaggeration of already present nervous symptoms. They may all be employed with discretion, in sickness, for the benefit of the patient.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Chew Your Food</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Teeth are to chew your food with. By “chewing food” is not meant that it simply be reduced to lumps or a consistency that will permit of swallowing, but that it be chewed, crushed, ground and mixed with saliva in such a manner that it may be readily digested when it reaches the stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Food should be chewed until it really “swallows itself”, that is, until it glides into the esophagus without the slightest effort, and until it is an effort to hold it longer in the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the pleasure of eating rests in the taste of food, you are missing nine-tenths of that pleasure by bolting or swallowing your food hurriedly. There are tastes and pleasurable sensations in food that are revealed only by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">complete</span><span class="font6"> mastication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you have any trouble with your teeth, or if they are not in such condition that they can chew and grind up your food without difficulty, have them taken care of by the best dentist in your locality. Many eases of supposed stomach trouble are not really due to stomach trouble or weakness at all, but the result of poor teeth or insufficient mastication.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>For Fat Folks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking generally, the foods which tend to put on weight are the starches, such as bread and potatoes, sugars and fats. The following list contains, first those articles which have this tendency, and then those which can be taken with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Articles to be avoided: Cream and butter. Bread, tea-cakes, scones and cake of all sorts. Porridge. The fat of bacon, ham or any other meats. Eggs. Red fish, as salmon and mullet. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, parsnips, artichokes and all other root vegetables. Puddings of all kinds. Pastry, sweets, jellies, jam and sugar. Apples, pears and bananas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following may be taken: Tea and coffee (but not cocoa). Milk in strict moderation. Dry biscuits, such as cracknel. Lean ham, bacon, tongue, white fish, thin soup, fowl and game, and the lean of butcher’s meat. Green vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes, peas, beans, asparagus. Cheese may be permitted in smail quantities.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Eat Less Meat</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">A common error of diet consists in using too much protein: more than </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font6"> what is known to be ample. This excessive proportion of protein is usually due to the extensive use of meat and eggs, although precisely the same dietetic error is sometimes committed by the excessive use of other high-protein foods, such as fish, shellfish, fowl, cheese, dry peas and beans, or even in exceptional cases, by the use of foods less high in protein when combined with the absence of any foods very low in protein. The idea of reducing the protein in our diet is still new to most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When protein is taken in great excess of the body’s needs, as is usually the case in the diet of Americans, added work is given the liver and kidneys, and their “factor of safety” may be exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Flesh foods (fish, shellfish, meat, fowl) when used in great abundance, are subject to additional objections. They tend to produce an excess of acids, are very prone to putrefaction, and contain “purins” which lead to the production of uric acid. This is especially true of sweetbreads, liver and kidney. The well known deficiency of lime in flesh foods often needs to be taken into consideration in the dietary. Some of the vegetable foods, such as peas and beans, rich in protein, are likewise not free from objection. Their protein is not always easily digested, and is, therefore, likewise liable to putrefaction, and they are much richer in purins than most meats. These foods are, however, rich in iron, which renders them a more valuable source of protein for children and anemic people than meat. Also, an excess of protein is not so likely to be derived from such bulky foods as from meat, which is a concentrated form of protein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great objection to meats is the fact that the nutriment from meats will quickly decompose in the blood stream if they are taken in too great a quantity: the body is unable to use it. The decomposition results in debilitation and disease unless it is quickly thrown off. There are many persons who do not need meats and should often abstain from this class of foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For instance, those who are overnourished and show signs of overeating do wrong to continue to eat meats, but should live for a time, at least until they get back to normal, on vegetables, fruits, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a class of people who suffer from deficient elimination who should eat very little of this class of foods. At blood temperature meats will decompose in one or two days, while vegetables at the same temperature will not decompose for ten to twelve days, and fruits will not decompose in a much longer time. This same process will be carried on with the nutrition from any foods that are eaten in too large a quantity; the excess cannot be taken up by the body in building and repairing waste, it will be seen that the nutriment from meats will decompose quickly, and that from vegetables and fruits will be much slower to decompose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that there would be no such condition if people would eat the proper amount of foods, but ninety-nine out of every hundred eat twice as much as they really need.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Constipation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The injury which comes from the retention of the body’s waste products is of the greatest importance. The intestinal contents become dangerous by being too long retained, as putrefying fecal matter contains poisons which are harmful to the body. Abnormal conditions of the intestines are largely responsible for the common headache malady, and for a generally lower resistance, resulting in colds and even more serious ailments. Constipation is extremely prevalent, partly because our diet usually lacks bulk or other needed constituents, but partly also because we fail to eliminate regularly, thoroughly, and often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Constipation, long continued, is by no means a trifling matter. It represents a constant and cumulative tax which often ends in very serious consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Free water-drinking when the stomach is empty, especially before breakfast, is beneficial in constipation. Excess of water should be avoided by the very feeble or those suffering from heart trouble or dropsy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Foods which are especially laxative are prunes, figs, most fruits (except bananas), fruit juices, all fresh vegetables, especially greens of all sorts, wheat bran, and the whole-grain cereals. Oils and fats are also laxative, but cannot be used in sufficiently large quantities to produce very laxative effects without producing loss of appetite. Foods which have the opposite tendency are rice, boiled milk, fine wheat flour in bread, cornstarch, white of egg.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Don’t Eat Too Much</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In furnishing the body its food supply, the first essential is to avoid overeating. Food is of no use in the body unless it is digested. To overeat is to prevent digestion; and undigested food in the body is worse than wasted, since such food rapidly ferments and decomposes and fills the body with poisons. These poisons lower the body’s disease-resisting power, overwork the vital organs, and pave the way for diseases of various kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a rule, people eat too much, and need to be reminded of the fact (tactfully, of course). It is astonishing to watch the improvement in health and energy which often follows a reduction in the amount of food taken. Many listless, tired patients become bright and vigorous after they have been persuaded to adopt this course. It is not uncommon to see thin people who have been overfed by their anxious relatives, and have become sallow and dyspeptic in consequence. In such cases it is difficult to convince the individual himself, and still harder to convince his friends, that he will not become thinner if he takes less food. Yet practical experience has shown that he not only fails to lose weight, but in many cases even puts it on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The absence of sugar and preparations of fruit preserves at the dining table minimizes the danger of overeating. There is no greater tempter to gluttony than sweets in any form, and without the stimulation of the latter the abnormal craving, due to the irritating condiment, will soon give way to a calm, natural state of gastric sensation, with an appetite expressing only the true nutrimental needs of the system. The line of safety in matters of diet must always be found on the minimum rather than the maximum side of quantity, even at running the risk of undereating. As expressed by Oliver Wendell Holmes, himself a physician, “A person seldom has cause to regret that he eats too little.” The small meal, well masticated, has twice the nutritional value of the larger meal, hastily and carelessly gulped down.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Starchy Foods</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Don’t eat too much of starchy foods (which include everything made of grains, as wheat, rye, corn, barley, rice, tapioca; also white and sweet potatoes, dry beans and peas). Most peo-pie eat too much starch, especially bread and potatoes. As we have said in another place, two decidedly starchy foods should not be eaten together ; for overeating is common to everybody, and eating two or more starchy foods together is equivalent to forcing digestion beyond its power of endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The usual method of cooking and baking starches does much toward rendering indigestible the body’s fuel supply. In this connection, let us remember that all starch is formed in minute cells; that to be easily digested starchy food must be either cooked or baked so it will not form a pasty mass. It is impossible for the digestive juices to permeate such a mass; consequently no small part of the starch so prepared ferments and becomes unfit for food. The proper cooking or baking of starchy food leaves it light and granular, a condition in which it disintegrates quickly in the stomach. In this condition the digestive fluids can rapidly saturate the food and digest it before fermentation can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Starchy foods must also be thoroughly cooked. The envelope or covering of the minute starch cells can scarcely be penetrated by the digestive juices; this envelope must be broken open by the cooking, else the starch will not be digested; consequently the cooking or baking must be thorough. Furthermore, thorough baking also accomplishes the first step in the digestion of the starches and thus lessens the work to be performed by the organs of digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another important essential in preparing the starches for the table is to avoid cooking and baking them with meats, fats or sweets. When cooked in this way, the fats or sweets toughen the cell envelope and alter the starch so as to make it difficult of digestion. When starches and fats are cooked together the fat prevents the digestive juices from saturating the starch, just as oiled silk will turn the rain. Starches should be cooked and baked practically alone. Some kinds of seasoning may be added after the cooking without lessening the food value or digestibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the light of the above facts it may be seen why cakes, pies, fresh breads and most hot breads, pancakes, fried potatoes and many other of our common foods are simply good food made indigestible by improper cooking. On the other hand, coarse-flour breads, well baked; boiled and baked potatoes, and well cooked cereals, represent the same foods prepared so as to make them easily digested. A pancake is practically indigestible in the average stomach; it is worse than a waste of food; on the other hand, the flour it contains, if made up in the form of hard toast, can be digested by anyone. A slice of cake is a hard blow to any stomach, but the flour made into hard toast, the shortening used to butter the toast, and the egg of the cake poached and served with the toast, give the body the same food material in an easily digested form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You should cook and bake your starchy foods thoroughly; cook and bake them alone, not mixed with other foods; cook and bake them so they will be light and granular, not soggy and pasty. Your stomach and your entire body will appreciate your fuel supply prepared in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After you have selected, prepared and cooked or baked your starchy food, all with care, you should then take some precaution as to what foods you combine with your starches. In making up a meal, just as in cooking, the more simple the meal the better. We need a variety of food, but it should not be cooked together, neither should it be eaten at the same meal. Starches digest best, especially when the digestion is impaired, when eaten with foods which neither contain acid nor acquire acid in their digestion. For this reason those who have poor digestion should avoid eating fruits, foods containing vinegar, and meats, with starchy foods. Milk and starches may be eaten together; eggs and starches combine only fairly well. Sugar ferments quickly and sets up the fermentation of starchy foods, and, consequently, except in those having vigorous digestion, should not be eaten with starchy foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The digestion of the starchy foods begins in the mouth, provided, however, these foods are properly masticated. All your foods should be thoroughly chewed, that the digestive juices of the stomach and bowels can permeate and digest the food mass quickly. However, mastication does more to the starchy foods than merely to grind them; it partly digests them. This digestion is accomplished by means of the saliva; consequently, if we are to digest our starchy foods, we must thoroughly masticate and insalivate them. Hard breads and hard starches of all sorts make mastication necessary, and thus favor normal digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man with a disordered digestion is, in all probability, undernourished, and, as a consequence, has an abnormal appetite which would lead him to eat of all food beyond his power of digestion. For this reason, this man should, for the time being, disregard his appetite and take all starchy food in moderation, learn the signs of non-digestion of his food, and reduce the amount taken until these signs gradually disappear. In this way he can gradually build up his power to digest the starches until he is able to take care of a sufficient amount to meet the needs of the body. When he has gotten his digestion built up to par, his appetite will become normal and can be depended upon as a reliable guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When starchy food is improperly prepared, or eaten in combinations which make digestion difficult, or eaten without being well masticated and insalivated, or taken in greater amounts than the digestive juices can digest,—when, on account of any or all these errors of diet, there is left in the stomach and bowels undigested starchy food, this food soon ferments just as it would in any warm, moist place. As this process of fermentation goes on gases and other injurious substances are formed, which exert a deleterious influence, not only upon the stomach and intestines, but upon the entire body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This process of fermentation frequently takes place first in the stomach, when its evil effects are first felt by that organ. The gases formed cause more or less belching; the acids which result from the fermentation cause acid eructations and sour stomach or a chronic over-acid condition of the stomach. In time the constant gas accumulation causes dilatation of the stomach, with all its attendant ills, while the constant irritation from the fermentation lowers the vitality of the membrane lining the stomach, and causes catarrh or ulcer of the stomach. In fact, practically all the disorders of the stomach are due directly or indirectly to the fermentation of the starchy foods in conjunction with the putrefaction of the meats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Starchy foods, when properly prepared and eaten, are digested and become the source of the vigor and energy of the body. When they are not properly prepared and eaten they may fail to digest, and, failing to digest, become poison that must be thrown out of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Breads, potatoes and cereals are the most common starchy foods. The starchy foods constitute the body’s fuel; they keep the body warm and do its work. For the average person the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">troubles should avoid</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Vinegar Pancakes Sauerkraut Pies, except custard, cream, pumpkin, or raisin</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cakes Pepper Pickles Candies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">starchy foods which contain only a moderate amount of starch are most suitable. The amount of starch needed varies with the person, the season, and the amount of work performed. The digestion of starch is completed in the small intestines, which process, when the starch is properly prepared and eaten, goes on normally, the digested starch furnishing the body with heat and energy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Foods to Avoid</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">People with stomach the following: Fresh bread Cranberries Fried potatoes Boiled cabbage Canned cherries Roasted Peanuts Fried cakes, crullers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catsups, and relishes of that nature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mushes</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Drinking at Meals</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Normal persons should drink between, rather than with meals, but those who are troubled with acid stomach (and this condition is present in nearly all cases of stomach trouble) can benefit by drinking water with meals. But never, of course, take water when food is in the mouth. In acid stomach the gastric juices are too strong or too abundant, hence should be diluted to prevent premature fermentation. Hence, water aids digestion by removing causes of irritation from both the stomach and the intestines.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Pyorrhea</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Half the people past thirty have pyorrhea in some of its stages. The cause of pyorrhea is a serum mucous from poisoned blood deposited through the glands of the gums on the teeth, which hardens, causing irritation, inflammation, suppuration and necrosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The treatment consists in removing all deposits and applying remedies that kill the disease, and restore the gums to a healthy state, followed by the best of care, and one treatment every six months. Five treatments will cure the average case, with little pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cause of the deposits is malnutrition and the wrong use of three fundamental principles of life:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nutrition—</span><span class="font6">Correct selection, combining, portioning and eating of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exercise—</span><span class="font6">That will keep the body vigorous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oxidation—</span><span class="font6">Deep breathing to purify the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been found that nine-tenths of all people troubled with pyorrhea, poor health, and all bodily ailments, poor teeth, stomach or intestinal troubles, constipation, defective assimilation of food, or elimination of food (waste), have failed in one or all of these three principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For perfect nutrition, use only undevitalized food made of the whole grain and unpolished rice to secure the vitamins and minerals it contains. This is absolutely essential for perfect nutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For breakfast use only one class of starch food; a small portion of crisp bacon is permissible ; no coffee or tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For lunch, one selection of fruit only. For dinner, eat, first, the dessert; second, baked potatoes; third, one vegetable; fourth, a small portion of meat with a large dish of salad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For exercise and oxidation (deep breathing) the following bed exercise is interesting and very beneficial, a balanced exercise bringing into action every part of the body, giving wonderful results, no time lost, no overwork, and the most complete exercise for deep breathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A little exercise at retiring is beneficial. Disrobe entirely. Stand erect, with hands and arms up. Swing arms and body forward, bending knees until the floor is touched. Return the body to erect position with hands and arras carried backward to the limit.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Colds</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Colds in the head are very prevalent. As soon as the symptoms of cold are felt try this method:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Inhale full and rapidly until relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If unable to breathe freely in the night, cross the feet, cover the face with both hands, and breathe through the nose, deep and rapidly, until relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If unable to sleep, try this: Inhale, first filling the diaphragm, then the chest to the fullest extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Exhale slowly, counting each until a miscount is made, then begin at one again. This rarely fails to bring sleep, as the mind is centered on counting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For life and efficiency, zealously practice breathing exercises, selecting, portioning, and eating all food so that all organs may be active and supplied with the minerals and nourishment needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These you can best work out for yourself. It is possible for everybody to gain and keep health, as I can testify from experience. At the age of ten I had trouble that almost unfitted me for future efficiency. At death’s door fourteen times. At sixty-five, having four incurable troubles. But at seventy-six, able to stand at the dental chair ten and twelve hours daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Carefully study and apply the principles of this article, and health will be regained with efficiency restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">APPENDIX</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Treatment for Systemic Pyorrhea</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the foregoing will be found “Pyorrhea— Its Cause and Treatment”. That the best results may be obtained we ask your cooperation with us in eradicating from the system the acid-itv and serum mucous poison that may cause all kinds of trouble that the system is heir to in addition to pyorrhea, which may now be cured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Deep breathing, exercise, selecting and the right combination of food are most important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You will get great benefit from a vigorous practice of the following exercises, especially the deep breathing. In nearly every exercise inhaling and exhaling is the important feature. To inhale, first fill the diaphragm, then the chest, and exhale slowly till all the air is forced out of the lungs, and while exhaling relax the muscles completely. Inhale and make the exercise while exhaling. Inhale and exhale in all the exercises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not try all the exercises at one time. Later you will make one hundred movements as easily as ten at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bed exercises excel all other exercises, in many features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is for the evening, also morning after taking the bed exercises. Disrobe entirely, stand erect, with hands and arms up, swing arms and body forward, bending the knees until the floor is touched. Return the body to erect position with hands and arms carried backward to the limit. Repeat ten to twenty times; also the arms swinging. Standing erect, swing the arms with a loop motion to the right and again to the left. Repeat ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the morning bed exercise. Position: Lying on the back in bed (disrobed), throw back the bed clothes and place the hands under the knees and begin the motion of running a race ten to fifty swings with vigor. This exercise is fine for the lungs and blood circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This exercise is to break up the effete matter that gathers on the walls of the colon and intestines, a source of a large share of the poisoned blood acidity, toxemia, and serum mucous that cause deposits on the teeth, causing pyorrhea, rheumatism, neuritis, hardening of the arteries, and many other ailments. On retiring the night previous to beginning Exercise No. 3, take a dose of some good laxative, to carry off the poisonous matter broken up. Position: Lying on the back in bed (disrobe, leaving the body exposed to the air and keeping the legs covered), feet crossed (to retain the magnetic current of the system, not generally understood, yet it is present, and the following movements will apply this current where needed), right hand on the body below the colon, the left hand covering the right, inhale, filling the diaphragm, then the chest; exhale and with heavy pressure move hands up to the ribs, then to the left and return to first position; inhale and repeat ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Feet crossed, lying on the side; one hand on back of neck, the other on spine, massage with both hands, using heavy pressure as you inhale and exhale. Repeat movement ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the back, feet crossed, place the ball of each hand on the lower ribs. With the fingers press deep under the ribs as you exhale. Now inhale quickly, at the same time making tense the muscles of the diaphragm. This exercise to massage the liver. Repeat ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the back, feet crossed, left hand on the neck, the right hand below, inhale and exhale, as with heavy pressure you sweep the hands down and back ten to fifty times. This is to stimulate all the organs in the front of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the back, feet crossed, hands on lower part of colon, exhale with heavy pressure. Inhale quickly as you make tense the muscles of the diaphragm. Repeat ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the back, feet crossed, inhale, filling, first the diaphragm fully, then the chest to the limit, exhale slowly until lungs are emptied of air, and at the same time make tense the muscles, drawing the left side up and the right side down and relax completely. Repeat, drawing the right side up and relax. Repeat and lift the body up on head and heels and relax. Repeat two to ten times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the stomach, feet crossed, hands on the spine, inhale and exhale fully as you massage the spine with heavy pressure ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: Lying on the stomach, feet crossed, the right hand grasping the left arm above elbow, and the left clasping the right elbow, inhale fully, exhale and at the same time raise the feet and head, turning it, while swinging the shoulders to the right as far as possible; relax, inhale, and repeat, turning the head and swinging the shoulders to the left; relax. Repeat ten to fifty times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exercise No. 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Position: As in exercise No. 10. Inhale and bring the hands to arm pits and raise the body to arms’ length; relax and repeat ten to fifty times, turning the head first to right and then to the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To clear the system of acidity, toxin, poison, toxemia, and serum mucous, occasionally take a three-day orange fast, eating only oranges, lemons, or grapefruit, and break the fast the evening of the third day with a cabbage salad, and ever thereafter eat lightly. For breakfast: Fruit, egg or bacon, and any food made from the whole grain. Let results be your guide. For lunch take fresh fruit, or raisins, figs, prunes, dates, with cottage cheese or cheese. For dinner : A vegetable meal and small portion of any protein food and big salad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The full inhalation by diaphragm, then the chest, and the complete emptying of the lungs by exhalation are very important. So is the complete relaxation after each exercise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">ERBS are the oldest form of medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hippocrates (460-370 B.C.), the “Father of Medicine”, was an herbalist. Botanical medication is the oldest branch of medicine. Even today primitive people limit their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">materia medico</span><span class="font6"> to herbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herbs are nature’s remedies, containing many substances which are necessary for building up and maintaining the organs of the body, and are of the greatest help in the performance of the vital functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herbs contain the vital elements (vitamins</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Herbs contain these bodies in such a finely distributed and prepared state that they are readily assimilated by the system and conveyed to the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herbs also promote the elimination of waste matter and poisons from the system by simple natural means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herbs, when correctly used, assist nature in its fight against disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herbs are consequently better suited for the treatment of disease than chemicals and other substances foreign to the human body. Therefore use herbs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Massacre of the Tonsils </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By H. B. Anderson (New York) </span><span class="font4">(Broadcast over station WEVD, New York City)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">N OCTOBER 3,1922, a delegation from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Citizens Medical Reference Bureau went before the board of superintendents of the New York City schools and protested against nurses’ going into homes and making threats or using pressure to induce parents to have the children treated in accordance with the recommendations of the medical inspector. The technical term used by school medical inspectors in this city is “hypertrophied tonsils” and the character of the treatment is supposed to be left to the physician, but the result of insisting upon treatment in such a large number of cases is what I have referred to as the massacre of the tonsils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Louis I. Harris, former commissioner of health of this city, in an article published in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Long Island Medical Journal,</span><span class="font6"> July, 1926, made this amazing statement relative to the superficial and unreliable character of the medical examinations carried on in the public schools at that time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When hypertrophied tonsils have appeared infrequently in the course of a day’s work, rest assured the inspectors will, 9 eases out of 10, find a sufficient number whether they exist or not.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The incompetence of many physicians who attempt to operate upon the tonsils is shown by the revelations contained in numerous editorials appearing in medical journals and by the increasing number of damage suits being filed against physicians as a result of such operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the Indiana State Medical Association,</span><span class="font6"> in its issue October 15, 1922, has this to say about incompetents:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Physicians without any training of any kind whatsoever are attempting to remove tonsils and adenoid tissue, with the very natural result of mutilating many throats, to say nothing of performing the operation in instances where it is not indicated. The amusing feature of the proposition, and one that is making the public skeptical, is the fact that it is such a regular feature with some general physicians who are attempting tonsil surgery to advise a tonsil and adenoid operation in every child, that they frequently advise such operations when no tonsils are present, the child having had a tonsil operation done previously in a very skillful and efficient way. We have no fault to find with the men who attempt to do things for which they are qualified and trained, but it does seem inconsistent to talk about the incompetency of quacks and charlatans when our own brethren exhibit such a woeful lack of the training that they should have to carry ou the work that they are attempting to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Times as Many Children Ill</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N A GIVEN area in New York city, surveyed by the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, 260 children were found ill in 1932, to compare with 91 in 1930. The Association also found in the same area that the number of families reporting no fulltime work for any member had increased 68 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An Effective Italian Tonic</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font6">AYS T. R. Weeks, pioneer: “The Italians know their garlic. The following is a general tonic recommended to me by an Italian who had seen it work wonders with his friends who had become run down. Fill a water glass two-thirds full with wine; add one tablespoonful of garlic, grated or chopped fine. Take a teaspoonful of the mixture four or five times a day, stirring the mixture on each occasion so as to get some of the garlic and some of the liquid. As explained to me, the secret is in the garlic; the wine acts as a stimulant to the digestive organs, thus aiding in getting the garlic more quickly into the blood stream.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seasickness Relieved at Once</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpHE discovery has been made that seasickness can be relieved at once by heating the small bulb of nervous tissue called the medulla oblongata, just at the junction between the spinal cord and the brain. When a mild heat from an electric current was thus applied, seasickness, carsickness and airsickness were all relieved.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Hygienic Cookery</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">(Extracts from copyrighted advertising literature of Fagley &amp;&nbsp;Halpen, manufacturers of steam cookers, Philadelphia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE question of cookery is very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a general rule authorities in cooking agree that many foods, and especially vegetables, should be cooked by steam instead of in water. We know that the valuable mineral salts, the proteids, the sugars, the vitamins, and medicinal properties which we find in vegetables are cooked out into the water by the old way of cooking, and destroyed, leaving merely the “skeleton” of the food behind, and destroying its life principles. But when we eat our vegetables and fruits steamed we obtain these important life-giving and life-sustaining substances in our food, which are noted by us in increased health and vitality and prolonged life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blood purifiers, tonics, laxatives, and a large proportion of drugs, whether prescribed by a physician or taken as patent medicine, would never be used if the diet were intelligently chosen. Physicians are recognizing the fact, and are therefore prescribing fewer drugs and giving more attention to food hygiene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There should never be a dinner served on the table but at least one of the following vegetables constituted part of that dinner: Red beets, spinach, carrots, turnips, onions, asparagus, rhubarb, celery. Red beets and spinach twice every week would be a better tonic than all the medicines in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chemists of the United States Department of Agriculture have proved that tin has absolutely no effect on the human body. They fed tin in two-gram doses to humans for five days, made refined analyses, and found no trace of tin in the blood stream, and no trace of tin had been absorbed by the human body. We ourselves ask, what would have happened if two-gram doses of pure aluminum compound had been fed into the human body for five days?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following was taken from the Weekly Bulletin, Department of Health, City of New York: “Out of nearly 1,000,000 school children examined by the Department of Health of New York City, the following results were obtained: 63 percent were showing signs of lack of nutrition, 20 percent were badly undernourished and in need of physician’s care, and only 17 percent were without signs of wrong diet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ida Bailey Allen, health scientist of Chicago, Illinois, states: “Out of 65,000 Chicago school children examined by the State Board of Health, 65 percent were found to be undernourished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By Associated Press dispatch, Washington, D. C., August 21, 1928: “Thirty percent of the American people are undernourished because of lack of proper understanding of food values, is declared by Miss Clyde B. Schuman, director of the National Red Cross nutrition department.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taken from the United States Department of Agriculture Farmer’s Bulletin No. 256: “When vegetables are immersed in water, as in boiling, a greater or less loss of material is almost inevitable. In experiments carried on under the auspices of the Office Experiment Stations it was found: that with potatoes the loss, in round numbers, amounted to about fifty percent of the nitrogenous material, and forty percent of the mineral matter present. And when potatoes were boiled peeled the amount of starch substance removed by abrasion was considerable, at times nearly thirty percent of the total value of the potato was removed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taken from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American Magazine</span><span class="font6"> for diseases of children: “The losses of mineral values in the different kinds of vegetables in their cooking preparation are as follows: Spinach boiled, loss 54 percent; steamed, loss 12 percent. Carrots boiled, loss 52 percent; steamed, loss 9 percent. Asparagus boiled, loss 48 percent; steamed, loss 13 percent. Cabbage boiled, loss 47 percent; steamed, loss 15 percent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taken from article by Edith Evans in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Correct Eating</span><span class="font6"> magazine: “Many a woman who is driving her own car, cleaning her house by electricity, using stainless knives and rotary egg beaters, is still using a skillet exactly like her grandmother’s and cooking her vegetables immersed in boiling water. And if you asked her how she prepared potatoes to preserve their nutritive qualities, she would probably give you her great-grandaunt’s recipe and be proud of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The trouble is a great majority of people can’t realize the importance of the proper cooking of food. The majority of those school children examined in New York city and Chicago were not undernourished because they had not eaten enough food. They were undernourished because the food they had eaten did not contain the nutritious mineral, nitrogenous, and vitamin values that it should. Those nutritious values had been boiled out of the food into the boiling water and wasted and poured down the kitchen sink.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>The Bible on Health and Cure of Diseases </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Olaf 0. Hage (Minnesota)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH through His prophets made the following promise, now soon to be fulfilled: “Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.”—Jeremiah 33:6; Isaiah 33: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the above scriptures refer to the kingdom now being ushered in, it is certain that if the Israelites had been faithful and obedient they would have been blessed with health and everlasting life.—Leviticus 18:5; Galatians 3: 11.12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord instructed them and put before them the perfect foods, but they “forsook God . . . and lightly esteemed the Rock of [their] salvation”. (Deuteronomy 32:9-26; 8:7-9) Instead of accepting such instructions and perfect foods, they started to complain bitterly, longing for the foods of Egypt. (Exodus 16; Numbers II) The Lord let them have their own wish to a certain degree, and they received a curse instead. (Numbers 11:32,33) God fulfilled His purpose, however. He knew they could not hold the law perfectly without a redeemer (Galatians 3:13); and the law was made a shadow of the better things to come. (Hebrews 10:1) But we l:now that there is no life in a shadow; so the Mosaic law. although perfect as a shadow, could not, in itself, give everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moses tells how they were fed on dairy products, fat of kidneys of wheat and the pure blood (juice) of grapes, but, since they turned to devil worship, the Lord hid His face from them. (Deuteronomy 32:14-21) The psalmist corroborates the words of Moses, saying that if they had been faithful and obedient the Lord would have, (kept it up) fed them with the finest (fat, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font6"> of wheat and honey out of the rock. The psalmist again prophesies that the Lord, during His kingdom, will do so.—Psalm 81:16; 147:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The glorified Christ (typed by Melchizedek) will bring forth bread and wine during the Millennium (to overcome the enemies of mankind —disease and death), when all the families of earth, through Abraham, shall be blessed.— Genesis 14:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is very reasonable, therefore, that such bread and wine must have life-supporting virtues, and it shall be my privilege to try to explain and prove this. The first explanation will be on bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We see that “fat” of the wheat is especially referred to. This would naturally mean the richest of the kernel. The germ of the kernel can be rightly termed the “fat” of the wheat, since it is said to contain 20 percent oil, and is exceptionally rich in minerals, especially the so-called “rare” ones. But it is also reasonable to presume that the gluten (protein of wheat) and possibly bran will be included if we are to take into consideration the animals that were sacrificed. The Bible says it must be finely ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yeast, the “leaven” of the Scriptures, cannot be used, however, and such bread must either be raised by soda and cream of tartar or aerated. Study of foods would seem to indicate that the mineral sodium is generally lacking; and the necessity of an abundant supply of potash, of the cream of tartar, will be mentioned later. Yeast used in raising bread destroys the natural sugars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before proceeding further, let it be understood that one of the greatest secrets of health and continued life is a blood stream completely and continually saturated with minerals in right combination. This, of course, shall mean a diet that supplies water through raw foods, milk, and fruit juices. Plain water does not supply minerals, but absorbs and carries same off with the toxins. A person using such a diet will not crave or need very much water, provided no flesh or salty foods are used. Flesh foods form toxins. The false craving for table salt is caused from a lack of a proper supply of minerals in the body; and salt is a poor substitute for such minerals. Furthermore, if the tissues, muscles, etc., do not have the proper amount of minerals they cannot hold the water which is so necessary to keep the flesh and bones in a youthful state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again turning our attention to above-mentioned bread, we find that it will be very rich in all kinds of minerals, and unusually so in the so-called “rare” ones. According to chemical analysis the germ is very rich in copper, zinc, manganese, iron and magnesium. White bread, on the other hand, has a very small amount of said minerals; in fact, copper and zinc can barely be detected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Copper, zinc and manganese are catalyzers. Magnesium, when burning to an oxide, may also be considered such, in a way. A catalyzer is a material that increases the speed of chemical</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">action which would nevertheless occur alone if the time were given. This alone would prove the possible benefit of such bread, but let us examine further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zinc, manganese and iron are growth stimulants, and there is reason to believe that they stimulate both metabolism and cell development. A scientist by name of Benson found that zinc functions as the soluble vitamin B; and if so, it has something to do in building nerves. It is possible that all the rare minerals function as the various vitamins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Magnesium may perform as the vitamin D when such is oxidized in the blood. When thus oxidized this mineral gives off certain rays similar to light rays. Hydrochloric acid, found in the gastric juice, and which is found to be absolutely necessary for digestion, cannot be readily formed in the body unless exposed to some kind of light rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Copper is very destructive to fungus and bacteria, and that such destructive properties have a great bearing on keeping the blood purified and the body free of disease is clear from the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yeast, the “leaven” of the Scriptures, is used to symbolize corruption. Yeast starts fermentation, and fermentation is caused from a fungus plant. In other words, yeast starts fungi growths. In Deuteronomy 28 we find mildew (a fungus) mentioned among the curses. It is my opinion, from study, that Jehovah thus made a record of the cause of contagious and infectious diseases by associating fungi with such diseases. There is every reason to believe from a study of tuberculosis and other similar diseases that these are caused by a fungi. Fungi and bacteria exist together. Fungi growths will interfere with blood circulation and proper functioning of the glands, thus cutting off nourishment to the cells. We know that if the bones to the spinal column do not get the proper materials to daily build up the worn-down cartilage there will be subluxations of the vertebrae and cut nerve force. We can thus see that improper nourishment from this cause will cause disease directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tissues of the body, the muscles, glands, bones, etc., are each composed of a large number of very tiny cells. These cells have been compared to bricks in a building, and they are held together by a material which may be likened to mortar. These cells are alive and constantly growing, and dying off, and thus such tissue, glands, muscles, bones, etc., are constantly being renewed. It has been found through experiments on chicken tissue, kept in a proper nourishing liquid, that when this tissue is regularly washed, to clear away such dead cells, this tissue has been kept indefinitely in a younglooking state; while, on the other hand, neglect of such washing has caused the tissue to grow old-looking. Is it not reasonable to suppose that copper, by its tearing-down action, aids as a medium to thus tread down dead cells and thus, if in proper amount, it will prevent decay and old age?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find on analysis of the liver of animals that the liver is a real storehouse of coppei' and the other rare minerals. The liver is comparatively larger in women than in men, and it is known that, on the average, women attain to a greater age. The reason for a larger liver in women is to accommodate two lives during child-bearing, which in itself is evidence of the great necessity of these minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not have any analysis of grapes that gives anything about the amount of rare minerals in same, but, as grapes are rich in iron, we may presume that there is a fair amount of copper, as this element is usually found with iron. Grapes have a goodly amount of phosphor, calcium, magnesium, ami are exceedingly rich in potash. In plant life we find that potash is necessary for assimilation of iron. If potash is short, iron accumulates in spots. Likewise, if phosphorus is lacking in the soil, alum will thus accumulate. If minerals act this way in plant life, it is logical to look for the same thing to happen in animal life. We know that iron, zinc, manganese and alum are growth stimulants; that some fungi in the presence of either of such grow much faster than without, and in presence of the first three together there is a still greater growth of such fungi. Is it not then logical to believe that such accumulations can start cancer growths? Cancer generally starts with lumps, sores, cracks, lacerations and ulcers which do not heal, and warts, moles or birthmarks which change in size, color or appearance. Likewise continued irritation may cause cancer growths. Changing birthmark, without a doubt, is mostly iron congestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cancer growths have been explained as follows: “Sometimes certain cells begin to grow and develop along lines which are not in harmony with the usual order. A little group of the cells seems to form a kind of lawless colony which constitutes an unhealthy and growing spot in the body.” These spots may occur in the various parts of the body. If these minerals just mentioned stimulate plant cells, why not cells in animal bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the people would keep in mind the words of the Bible, “The life of the flesh is in the blood,” and use proper foods, like the abovementioned, together with plenty of honey with comb, fruits, like the iron-rich fig, etc., there would not be much for the doctor to do.—Leviticus 17:11; Exodus 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, we know that during Christ’s reign the curse of the ground will be removed and the trees and grains shall yield their strength, and we shall have perfect fruits, grains, milk, etc. This, naturally, will be done by proper fertilization. Thus the Lord will cleanse their blood, and they shall sit under their vine and fig tree and none (not even their enemy, death) shall make them afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Jehovah sent the bread, manna, from heaven to typify the coming Christ, the Scriptures seem to make it clear, according to our Lord’s own words, that Jehovah will also give bread and wine to mankind to give perpetual life and which shall be a memorial to Christ, who offered himself as a ransom.—Genesis 3: 17; Joel 2: 21-24; 3: 20, 21; John 6: 53, 54; 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”—Revelation 21:4.</span></p>

The man explained that he waited until after the young woman had received Holy Communion before he murdered her. He wanted to be sure her soul was all right. That is lovely. And so we urge all our Roman Catholic readers that before they kill anybody they first make sure that their souls are all right. All that is necessary is to see that they have gone to mass that morning. After that, they can be killed at leisure.</span></p>

That is why sainthood came free in apostolic times and comes so high now. It seems that the more you pay for a saint, the less you can bet that the saint is a real one. The prices should come down, even if it is hard on the priests. Why whoop up the saint business in these hard times? We already had enough bogus saints, without Chicago’s horning in; but that is a way Chicago has ever had.

<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Scant Time and Space to Correct Falsehoods</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford and those associated with him as Jehovah’s witnesses have scant time to correct falsehoods, but it becomes necessary when one is in conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, as experience has shown that nothing the Roman press has to say about the Watchtower organization can be believed. Hence in this issue we refer once more to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> Cleveland, Ohio, issue of December 15, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On its front page </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> has a column bearing the following headlines: “Watch Tower Tries Ruse to End Radio Curb; Doorbell-Ringers Pose as ‘Defenders of Father Coughlin’ and Circulate Petitions; Public Warned Against Hoax; Rutherford’s Avowed Aim Is to Demand Free Use of Air.” The article, which is two columns long, contains the following paragraphs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Zealots seemingly aglow to keep Father Coughlin on the air are canvassing the city with petitions asking Congress to guarantee the right of free speech by way of radio. Close questioning reveals their wiles, for they are agents of the Watchtower syndicate that sponsors the fast-fading Judge Rutherford.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Guileless Catholics have signed the petition in a number of instances thinking they were backing up the militant radio-priest of the Little Flower Shrine, Royal Oak, Michigan. In reality they were petitioning for the return of the arch-reviler of the Papacy and the Church to the unrestricted air-channels of America.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> is merely an attempt of the Devil to try to gain some benefit from the work that Jehovah’s witnesses are now doing. Ordinarily we do not know or care what any of the Roman Catholic press say about us, but, to correct this lie, it seems advisable to give our subscribers the facts about the petition work, so that they may see how it originated and the methods by which it has been carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything is in print, in black and white, open and aboveboard. Mr. Coughlin is not mentioned in any way, shape or form, and it was not intended that he should be. Millions of the people approached with this petition have never even heard of the man and his little flower shrine and do not know that there is any such place as Royal Oak, Michigan. The Catholic windbags take themselves too seriously.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>The Printed Instruments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">We have before us all the instruments used, in the petition work. The first is Judge Rutherford’s 64-page booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom. </span><span class="font6">It contains three of his lectures: “The Way of Escape,” “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity,” and “Kingdom Blessings for the People”. Four million copies have been printed and circulated. It does not mention Mr. Coughlin in any way. Furthermore, the three addresses contained therein were broadcast all over America, not only once, but several times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The explicit printed instructions to the petition circulators were that they were to go to the homes with the above booklet, and to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have come to bring you a message of good cheer, and when you hear it your heart will be glad. The times are very hard and the people continue to suffer, and there is just one way of escape from even greater trouble. Jehovah God has provided that way, and it means safety and prosperity to those who learn about it and follow in it. This booklet [producing the booklet] gives a clear and plain statement of just what everyone now needs to know. You will want to be able to tell your friends and neighbors about it. Would you like to read the booklet and contribute five cents to help get it into the hands of others? If so you may be assured of the Lord’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the next step they were to hand to each person the following (published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font6">No. 371, page 138), asking them to read it carefully :</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Are You in Favor of Liberty?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Wish Intrenched, Selfish Interests to Deprive the People of the Right to Hear by Radio What Is Desirable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">U</span><span class="font5">NDER the pretext of “tolerance” that intrenched, selfish crowd is now engaged in a movement to force the radio stations to broadcast only what pleases them and to thus deprive the people of their just rights to hear the truth. They are trying to force off the air men who are faithfully telling the people God’s Word of truth concerning the cause of world distress and what is His remedy. Nothing could be of greater importance to you than to hear these truths now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True democracy is fast disappearing from the earth. In behalf of truth and righteousness you still have the opportunity to protest and petition. To enable you to exercise this right, a petition is now being circulated. It is of the greatest importance that you act quickly. Sign the petition calling upon the Congress to safeguard the rights of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The exact language in which these instructions were couched is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Hand to each person the leaflet, asking him to read it carefully, and say that you will call back later. Even though no one is home when calling, leave the leaflet under the door, because it may be they will be at home when you call for the signing of the petition. Do not waste any time explaining anything, because the leaflet will do that.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>The Petition Itself</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The petition itself was to be circulated after the witness work was done, and in many instances would be by the hand of others. The exact language of the instructions on this point is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ It is suggested that in the evenings, after you have witnessed with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font5"> booklet and left the leaflets, you call back for their signatures to the petition. If those witnessing during the day cannot do the back calling in the evening, other brethren who are not privileged to be in this work during week-days can, after their secular employment is finished, make the back calls in the evening with the petition. This will give all the brethren an opportunity to work at this during the week as well as at week-ends.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The form of the petition itself is set forth in our issue of December 6, 1933, page 138, which please see. No Roman Catholic is mentioned personally in any of this literature. References to the ‘pope’ cannot be considered personal, as he is the titular head of a system. The only way the Roman Catholic hierarchy is mentioned in the petition is in the following sentence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and others, have wrongfully by threats, coercion and other improper influence prevented many stations from broadcasting this message of truth, thus depriving stations of legitimate income and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear; and against this wrongful action we vigorously PROTEST.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would suit us better if the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its press would confine itself to the truth and to a manly and honorable course of conduct, but inasmuch as the whole system is (as the Bible shows) a system of lies from top to bottom, and given over to unmanliness and dishonorable methods, all we can do is to register our protest and let the matter drop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* In some instances permission was granted to obtain signatures to the petition at the first interview, which, however, always included first the presentation of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font4"> booklet and the mention of the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Obedience Brings Honor in the Temple</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">T IS the expressed will of God that those who serve Him faithfully will eventually come to honor, and it is in this sense only that the faithful “seek for glory and honour and immortality”. If one’s motive in worshiping or serving Jehovah God is because of any honor he gets out of it in this life, or because of any honor that he expects to get out of it in any life, then his worship and service count for nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The passage in the second chapter of Romans must be considered in connection with its context. The apostle, pointing out both the right and the wrong course, concludes with a reference to “the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life”.—Romans 2: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle (addressing himself to the church, the body of Christ) thus seems to say that the end of those who patiently continue in well doing and who are fully faithful to their covenant is that they should obtain the glory, honor and immortality that God has provided as the reward of such a course, but if, for any reason, that goal be not attained by others, there is good reason to hope that everlasting life on some plane at least will be their portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time element enters in. From the time of the first advent to the coming of the Lord to His temple for judgment, it was proper to hold out the reward of glory, honor and immortality as being the logical result of a life of obedient and jovful worship and service of the Most High’. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It does not seem that such reward can now be so freely mentioned. The way is opening for the Jonadabs, ami millions of them will come to everlasting life right here in this world, and there will be a measure of glory and honor connected with their experiences, but not immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jonadabs are not in the temple or of the temple, and are conscious of that fact, but it does not make them unhappy, nor should it. It is a great privilege to even be brought in contact with the temple work and with those who, because of their faithfulness in the doing of the temple work entrusted to them, will eventually be a part of the temple of the Lord in glory. That in itself is a signal favor and will be so esteemed by them and by all in the ages to come.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>See How John Puts It</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">See how John puts this matter of personal contact with Jesus, the Father’s first and bestloved Son. He writes most endearingly, most tenderly, of “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life”. —1 John 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sixty years after Jesus had gone to be forever with the Father, John wrote the vivid accounts of the gracious Guest at the wedding feast who turned the water into wine; of the burning zeal of Him who cleansed His Father’s house of those that were making it a house of merchandise; he heard the heart-searching interview with Nicodemus, and with the Samaritan woman at the well; he knew all the circumstances attendant upon the healing of the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda, and about the restoring of sight to the one blind from his birth. He knew the story of ‘the good shepherd who giveth His life for the sheep’, of the raising of Lazarus from the dead, and of Jesus’ washing His disciples’ feet. He was present and heard and remembered the Lord’s last comforting discourse to His disciples, and even remembered the concluding prayer. That he literally handled the Word of life, in obedience to Jesus’ own invitation, we may judge from Luke 24:39, 40:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John is the only one of the apostles who mentions the foregoing incidents in the Lord’s life. In some of these instances he was probably the only one who saw sufficient of the incident to be able to make a clear record of it, but, in any event, we know that John was deeply impressed with them all, and has left their impress indelibly upon all Christians from then to now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Looking now again at the “Jonadabs”: Can we suppose that Jonadab ever forgot his ride with Jehu? (2 Kings 10:15-23) Or, for that matter, can we suppose that he ever will forget it? How could he? It meant more to him than all the other experiences of his life put together. Just now the antitypical Jehu is taking the antitypical Jonadab for a ride, and before he gets through with that ride he will have stored</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">up observations, instructions and experiences that he will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Typical Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We return to the typical temple at Jerusalem, as it stood in the days of the Lord, and consider some of the rules and regulations then in force. None might enter the temple with a staff in his hands, or with a purse; money, if carried, must be in his hand. He might not wear shoes, nor might he have dust upon his feet. If necessary for him to spit, it must be in some corner of his own garment. He might not use any irreverent gesture in front of the temple. He might not pass through the temple grounds on any errand. He must demean himself as if in the presence of Jehovah God. He must worship standing, with his eyes on the ground and his hands clenched upon his bosom. Having worshiped, he must not turn his back upon the altar, but must back away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These restrictions, with others that were in force, help us to see how the temple appeared to the fleshly Israelite. To him it represented the presence of God in the midst of His people. And that was really true. God had really promised the Jews that when they came to Jerusalem, as required, He would meet with them at the temple, and He so did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony.—Exodus 25: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing, which applied to the tabernacle, was confirmed by the Lord as respects the temple. After the temple was built, the Lord said to Solomon: “I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.”— 1 Kings 9: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pretense of the Roman Catholic church that God is present in every one of their churches is only a pitiful counterfeit or swindle based upon the reality of the literal temple as it existed in the days of our Lord. The only god that is present in every Roman Catholic church building, and in every other creedal church building, is the god of this world.—2 Corinthians </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Simeon’s Blessing in the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is hard for us to get any adequate measure of the great blessing that was poured out on Simeon at the first advent of the Lord. Simeon was not a priest; he was not anything special; he was just a plain man; but he loved God. The account says of him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the holy [spirit] was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the holy [spirit], that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.—Luke 2:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Picture the scene! Here is a man who has lived all his life in the shadow of the temple of God and in reverence of the word of God. He knows why sin is in the world; he knows that he is living in the times of the Gentiles; he knows that a savior is promised, and has been promised for more than four thousand years, a savior who not only will break the shackles of the Roman yoke fastened upon him and upon his people, but will break the bands of death that tie man to the tomb from the moment of his birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverently he goes over the Scriptures, seeking to understand them. He knows if help is to come it must come from on high, because the psalmist so intimates. Who is this mighty one ? Whence can he come? How will he make his appearance? How can the people be sure of his identity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No doubt he had heard of the birth of the babe at Bethlehem. The shepherds, only forty days previously, had heard the song of the angels, declaring, ‘Unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord,” and, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men,” and then they had gone and found the babe in the manger and had declared the good news far and wide.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>No Doubt Simeon Had Prayed for Help</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Though the fact is not mentioned, there is not the least doubt that Simeon had heard these stories and had prayed for help. He believed that if ever there could be a time when there was need of a savior, and a great one, it was then, and without a doubt he had gone upon his knees and asked the great Jehovah God, if the good news was really true, then to make it clear to him, so clear that he could not doubt the divine leading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How his prayer was answered we do not know, for God could answer a prayer in any of a million ways and still make His purposes as clear as crystal. He may have sent an angel to tell Simeon by word of mouth, or He may have pointed him to one of the scriptures respecting our Lord’s virgin birth, or the place of His birth, or the attendant circumstances, as recorded by various of the prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In any event Simeon was fully convinced, fully satisfied, and so we read that at just the right moment “he came by the Spirit into the temple”. The heavenly Father timed it all, or the angels did it for Him, for they are all as interested as He.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Simeon came in one way Joseph and Mary came in the other, “to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.” The size of this offering is taken as evidence that Joseph and Mary were among the very poor. They gladly gave what they could, but their means were limited and they could do little more than make an acknowledgment of the love and gratitude that welled up in their hearts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>Simeon Needed No Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Simeon needed no introduction to the young couple who had in their keeping the greatest treasure that had ever been presented in the temple. All the golden furnishings and golden vessels of the house of the Lord were as nothing compared with that little mite of humanity, barely forty days old, that they brought in with them. Quite likely there were other parents there that morning on the same errand, but Simeon instinctively was made to know which one was of special interest to him and to all mankind, and so we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite reasonably and naturally Joseph and Mary were moved by these things, and it says that they marveled at the things spoken. The account proceeds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>Simeon Was a Prophet</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">We thus see that Simeon was a prophet, for all that he has spoken of the little babe has come to pass. He has been indeed a light to lighten the Gentiles, He has been indeed the glory of His people, He was indeed set for the fall of fleshly Israel and for the rising again of spiritual Israel. A sword indeed did pierce Mary’s heart when she saw her innocent son, holy, harmless and undefiled, separate from sinners, die upon the tree between two thieves, and this Judge of all the earth does indeed now lay bare the thoughts of many hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But Simeon was more than a prophet. He was a much-loved servant of Jehovah God. He cannot have been of the body of Christ, because he was at the time of Christ’s birth an aged man and expected shortly to pass away, and no doubt did pass away soon thereafter. To have been begotten of the spirit he would have had to live on many years; it was 33y<sub>2</sub> years from then to Pentecost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so we can see Simeon occupied a peculiar place, in many respects like that of the Jonadabs now living, and yet very different. Simeon was brought in touch with the babe Jesus, at the first advent, before the advent of the spirit dispensation. The Jonadabs are brought in touch with the Man Christ Jesus when that company, the body of Christ, as we understand, is complete, in glory, and a remnant thereof still on this side the vail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Simeon’s inheritance is an earthly inheritance; so is Jonadab’s. Simeon’s greatest blessing was in the temple, or connected with it. The Jonadabs are getting their greatest blessing, their greatest experience of life, through being brought in contact with the temple work, the Jehu work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Simeon had to die and wait for his inheritance, wait for the Kingdom promised, but the Jonadabs are already under the Kingdom, and have only to be true and faithful and they shall pass through the fires of Armageddon unscathed and go over into the age of peace and joy everlasting where Simeon and all the other faithful ones from Abel to John the Baptist will bless them with their friendship and participate with them in spreading the praises of Jehovah’s great name to earth’s remotest bounds.</span></p>

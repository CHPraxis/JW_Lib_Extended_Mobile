<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH permitted Daniel and other faithful men to be carried away captive to Babylon for the purpose of there giving a testimony to the name of the Most High and looking forward to the vindication of his name. The terms of the controversy raised by Satan’s challenge would necessarily require such faithful witnesses to be subjected to very severe trials and that while passing through such trials those witnesses must have and exhibit full faith and confidence in God. Knowing that whatsoever things were written in the divine record aforetime were, there recorded and preserved for the comfort and assurance of the remnant now on earth, with confidence we examine the divine record made concerning the three Hebrew children in the crucible, and we may expect to find therein comfort and assurance, that those who in this day are wholly devoted to God may have hope.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Daniel, by the grace of Jehovah, had interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s forgotten dream, and which interpretation now made known to the remnant discloses to them what constitutes Satan’s invisible organization, as well as his visible, and by what means Jehovah will destroy that wicked organization. (Dan. 2:19-45; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1930, pages 227-233, 243-248) Nebuchadnezzar, after receiving the interpretation of his dream, fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel, thus foreshadowing the Greater Daniel, Christ Jesus, interpreting the purpose of Jehovah, and the worship of him by those who are devoted to God and to Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Time and again in the Scriptures it is written, “And they shall know that I am Jehovah.” The Devil had defamed Jehovah’s name, but now God had made the Devil’s representative see some light: “The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.” (Dan. 2:47) That caused Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge that Jehovah is God. It was the beginning of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which Babylon had defamed by destroying Jerusalem. At this point Daniel is used to picture Jesus Christ at the time he is sent forth to “judge and make war”. The name “Daniel” means “God’s judge”; which high position is filled by Christ Jesus. (John 5:22) This record, together with what follows in Daniel the third chapter, shows that Ibis prophecy applies to the “day of Jehovah”, in which daj’ his holy name must be vindicated. The World War and attending conditions marked the beginning of the fulfilment of the great prophecy uttered by Jesus in Matthew twenty-four. The fulfilment of that prophecy shows that the time had arrived for the ‘Stone cut out of the mountain without hands’, described in Daniel’s prophecy, to move into action against Satan’s organization, which in Daniel’s prophecy was pictured by the dreadful image. What King Nebuchadnezzar said to Daniel in acknowledgment of tnc supremacy of Jehovah was thus proved true by what came to pass in 1914 and thereafter. During the time from 1914 to 1918 there was a measure of admission by the Devil’s organization that the same is true. Nebuchadnezzar ‘made Daniel a great man and ruler in Babylon and placed him over the wise men of Babylon’. (Dan. 2:48) Such in a measure foreshadowed the coming exaltation of Christ Jesus at the time God enthrones him and when Jesus takes Satan and casts him out of heaven.—Ps. 2: 6-9; Kev. 12:1-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">‘Daniel was mindful of his brethren who had been carried away captive with him, and he then and there, made request in their behalf: “Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.” (Dan. 2:49) This finds a parallel in the present time when Jesus Christ at the. temple gathers to himself his faithful ones and shares the honor and privilege of the kingdom with them. In harmony with the will of God Christ Jesus gathers these faithful ones into the temple, clothes them with the garments of salvation and covers them with the robe of righteousness, and invites them into his joy, which is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. To them is then committed the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">m</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> It appears that Daniel’s three friends, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego represented the remnant who are Jehovah’s witnesses, for the reasons following: Their Hebrew names were Ilananiah, Mishaei, and Azariah. (Dan. 1:6) “The prince of the eunuchs gave [them] names” according to the Babylonian tongue. To Ilananiah he gave the name Shadrach; to Mishaei, the name of Meshach ; and to Azariah, the name of Abed-nego. (Dan. 1:7) The Babylonian name “Shadrach” means “decree of the moon god”. The Hebrew name “Ilananiah” means “whom Jehovah has graciously given” or “Jehovah hath been gracious” or “Jehovah has favored”. “Meshach” means “guest of the king”, or “ram”, the name of the sun god. Uis Hebrew name “Mishaei” means “who is like God”, The Babylonian name “Abed-nego” means “servant of Nogo” (that is, of Nebo, the god Mercury). His Hebrew name “Azariah” means “helped by Jehovah”, The Babylonian names given to these three faithful Hebrew persons evidently were names of some of the nephilim who had for a long while operated with Satan in ruling the world. It would be like Satan to want to perpetuate the names of these under-ofiicers in bis organization amongst men on the earth. These three faithful Hebrew men were “children of Judah”, or Judeans. (Dan. 1:6) They had connection with the royal family of David, since it is recorded they were “of the king's seed, and of the [other] princes”. (Dan. 1:3) This strongly supports the conclusion that those three faithful men represented God's remnant now on earth who as the sons of God have been invited into and taken into the covenant for the kingdom and are companions of Jesus Christ, the Greater Daniel, and whom the Devil seeks to entrap and destroy.— Dan. 2:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“Doubtless these three faithful Hebrews had rendered assistance to Daniel in connection with the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and for that reason Daniel made request of Nebuchadnezzar to grant to these three brethren of his some place in his kingdom. They were in the class of the “wise men”, and therefore had been in danger of losing their lives, together with Daniel, and their prayers had been to Jehovah that he would manifest his favor in giving wisdom and power to Daniel to the vindication of His name. This furnished the occasion for Daniel to be a witness for Jehovah before the king of Babylon and therefore to tell the day of the vengeance of our God. and also the good news of the setting up of Jehovah’s kingdom through The Stone, Christ Jesus. (Dan. 2:27-30) The three Hebrews above mentioned, at the request of Daniel, were given certain duties to perform in the government of Babylon. They were in Satan’s world but were no part of it. God permitted them to be there that they might serve as witnesses for him; thus they pictured the company of God’s remnant today on earth who are in the world but are no part of it and who are given certain duties to perform as Jehovah’s witnesses and to proclaim the message of the vengeance of our God, calling attention of the people to the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through Christ Jesus. Daniel sat at the court of the king. (A’.D., margin) He pictured Christ Jesus, who, as the Greater Daniel, sits in Jehovah’s palace, temple or court and thus fills the position that brings him in close communion with the great Emperor of the universe, Jehovah God. (Hah. 2:20; Mal. 3:1) As Daniel and his three Hebrew brethren were in the world of Babylon bearing testimony to the name and power of Jehovah, even so now Christ Jesus and the remnant are ‘in the midst of the enemy’, bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah.—Rev. 12:17; Ps. 110:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Nebuchadnezzar pictured regal power which sometimes is used for good, when diligently engaged in doing the will of God, and at other times is used to represent the Devil hypocritically using liis power in a wicked manner. The third chapter of Daniel as compared with the last two verses in the second chapter of Daniel's prophecy notes such a change. “Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Duia, in the province of Babylon.” (Dan. 3:1) This opining of the third chapter shows Nebuchadnezzar acting particularly as the representative of the Devil, because he now violates God’s law, to wit: ‘Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I am the Lord [Jehovah] thy God. I am a jealous God.’—Ex. 20:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ The image of gold made b.v Nebuchadnezzar, and described in the. foregoing, pictures the entire organization of Satan, both visible and invisible. Being of gold would indicate that this organization under Sa-Ian included the spirit creatures that formed Ihe original invisible organization of Lucifer, which spirit creatures joined Satan in his rebellion, and are otherwise mentioned in the Scriptures, when they material-iz&lt;d as i cphilim, and as angels which “bear rule over all the earth”. (Gen. 6:4, zl.A’.V.; Dan. 2:39) The image here described compares with the terrible image seen in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, as recorded in the second chapter of Daniel’s prophecy, and may have been suggested to Nebuchadnezzar’s mind by that dream. The Babylonian cubit was twenty-one inches; hence that image was 105 feet tall and 10! feet broad. Being ten times as high as it was broad would well picture the loftiness of Satan’s organization in its invisible parts, and compares with Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the big tree in the midst of the rarth, “the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.”—Dan. 4:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The image was set up in the plain of Dura, which was the central or key part of all the empire of Babylon. “Dura” means_ “circle” or “enclosed place”. Doubtless this plain was a part of the plain of Siiinar where Nimrod, under the direction of the Devil, built Babylon. (Gen. 11:2) The colossal image above described could be seen from ail parts of the plain. It therefore pictured the manner in which Satan sets up his organization over the earth and man. .Evidently the golden statue was so located in the king's land for his pleasure and convenience, it being near’ the capital city and the palace. It was the place for mass worship by the officials of the Babylonian government, and hence pictured Satan’s official organization both invisible and visible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Keeping always in mind the issue raised by Satan’s defiance we may be fully assured that everything Satan does is fox’ the purpose of supporting his side of the controversy and to bring reproach upon God and to turn men away from the .Most High. Keeping this great issue in mind enables us to locate the time of the fulfilment of Daniel’s prophecy relative to the great image of gold erected in the plain of Dura. “Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the, counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.’’ (Dan. 3:2) This verse of the prophecy describes a gathering together or assembly of the officials of the nation, to wit, the political, religious, commercial, judicial, and the law-enforcement element, or strong-arm squad. It was a matter of world importance, because Babylon was then </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font3">world power. The “image” was set up on the “plain of Dura” in 606 B.C., and Satan’s world has continued since; but from ami after 1918 Satan lays special stress on his organization because he knows that bis time is short before the great battle of Armageddon is fought. It was about 1918 that he began to assemble or “gather together” the official element of the whole earth to use them in due time in the battle, and in doing this he uses the three “frogs”, as described in Revelation 16:13,14. Satan’s purpose is to turn all mankind, including the true worshipers of Jehovah, away from the true God and to the worship of creatures or the work of creatures’ hands, or else to destroy them. The League of Nations is therefore brought into existence by Satan, and was set up in the year 19.19, and his religious ‘nobles’ on the earth then with uplifted “holy hands” hailed it as the expression of God’s kingdom on earth, and now say of it: ‘The League of Nations is the oidj<sup>r</sup> light there is.’ Thus the Federation of Churches declare that Satan's organization produces the only light that there is, and thereby deny Jehovah God and his kingdom and the great King, who is the light of the world. The great golden image erected in the plain of Dura therefore pictured the entire organization of Satan; and tne League of Nations is Satan’s dummy son, which causes to shine the only light that Satan's agents now have on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The king Nebuchadnezzar set a day for the dedication of the golden image which he had caused to be set up. &quot;Whatever local or tribal gods were worshiped in the various sections of the Babylonian empire, these for the time must be set aside and, according to the command of the king, there must be one common deity, higher power or authority which all must worship, and the king Nebuchadnezzar must be the dictator of that authority. The golden image was dedicated to the Devil, being produced by his authority. It certainly was not dedicated to Jehovah God, the God of Daniel and his three Hebrew companions. It was a creature-made thing and was the greatest religious effort that Babylon or Satan’s organization had ever put forth to control the peoples of earth up to that time. The miniature dedication took place at the assembly of the officials of Babylon, but the real and greater dedication takes place after the ‘birth of the man child', that is, the beginning of the kingdom of God, in 1914, when Christ Jesus was placed upon his throne and sent forth to rule. The beginning of the kingdom was a challenge to Satan’s organization. The greater dedication to the image of gold; that is to say, Satan’s organization, is approximately at the time the two great signs or wonders appear in the heavens, as mentioned in Revelation the twelfth chapter. The two ‘signs’, or ‘wonders’, symbolically represented God’s organization and Satan’s organization in opposition; hence, all the official element of Satan’s organization on earth must take their stand for one or the other of these organizations, and thus clearly identify themselves. Jehu, as the servant of God, had forced the identification one way, and now Nebuchadnezzar, as the servant and representative of the. Devil, forces the identi-fieation in the very opposite way. In both instances those who stood faithful to God took their stand on God’s side and the enemies of God took their stand on the side of the Devil and his organization. The purpose of the Devil in forcing the identification after the ‘birth of the man child’ is that he might “get” or destroy Jehovah’s witnesses; and this is shown by his act of setting up the golden image that he might “get” or destroy Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. Since 191S Jehovah’s witnesses have been bearing testimony to the kingdom, and Satan’s determination is to destroy them; and he organizes a conspiracy into which he draws his officers, the purpose, of which is to cut off Jehovah’s witnesses from being a nation. (Ps. S3:1-5) Both in setting up the golden image in Babylon, and in the greater dedication since 1914, Satan is endeavoring to show that he is ihe ‘god of the world’ and his right to rule must continue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Not even the faithful followers of Christ Jesus saw this “image of gold”, that is, Satan’s organization, until alter 1921. It was at the Cedar Point assembly of the followers of Christ Jesus in the year 1922 that the Resolution or “Challenge” there sent forth by Jehovah’s witnesses definitely mentioned Satan's organization. It must have been about that time that the “golden image” ox’ Satan’s organization antitypieally was forced to be dedicated to the modem world and its rulers. Even today there are not many in the world aside from the anointed who sec or discern Satan’s organization. The three principal elements constituting the ruling power in earth are what today are called &quot;yes men&quot; and assemble and bow before the Devil’s organization, as described as follows: &quot;Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs; and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.”—Dan. 3:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” The Devil had tried to hide from &quot;Christendom” knowledge even of the existence of himself, and also the fact of the existence of his organization. By this means ho expected to entrap them all. Now Jehovah causes Satan’s organization to be brought to light, and causes his own witnesses to give testimony concerning the same, particularly as a warning to all people of good will, and as a notice and warning to the nations of the earth in general. To offset Jehovah’s purpose Satan brings forth his organization, pictured by the golden image, as a thing to be worshiped, adored and served. Satan is thereby thrust into the open and becomes bold through his earthly agents in declaring his production, the League of Nations, as representing his earthly organization as a thing to which all people should give allegiance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Even though Jehovah by his strong &quot;right am”, Christ Jesus, did cast Satan and his organization out of heaven about 1914, yet he did not destroy that organization at that time, but has suffered or permitted it to remain to serve his own purpose, including just such a fiery test as that which now comes upon his people, as pictured by the fiery test that came upon the three faithful Hebrews. That test here and now involves the faithful remnant on the earth. After 1918 all the leaders and prominent ones of the earth were forced to stand before Satan’s organization. All who were in the world must stand before this image of Satan’s organization regardless of whether they are &quot;not of the world” even though in the world. All arc in the world, and the attempt is to force everybody to stand before the Devil’s organization. In 1922, when the attention of God’s faithful witnesses on earth began to be called to the fact of the existence of Satan’s powerful organization, the faithful then began to take their &quot;stand” before Satan’s organization, but against it and definitely on the side of Jehovah, which is pictured by the three Hebrews in Babylon who took their stand definitely on Jehovah’s side. At the same time those of Satan’s official organization on earth, and all whom they influenced and controlled, began to take their stand before the &quot;image” and on the side of Satan, and have continued thus to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Now the three &quot;frogs” of Revelation sixteen, and particularly the &quot;false prophet” frog, as the herald of Satan, begin to bellow forth the message of Satan, just as the herald cried out in Babylon: &quot;To you it is commanded, 0 people, nations, and languages.” (Dan. 3:4) The &quot;herald” there would well picture the &quot;loud-speakers” or earthly mouthpieces of Satan’s organization w<sup>r</sup>ho say just what Satan directs them to say. The message delivered by the “herald” was directed, as the scripture says, to &quot;people, nations and languages”, which means specifically to the rulers of the people, nations and languages. Such rulers were at that very time present, standing in front of the golden image, because they had been assembled by the king for that purpose. Their people whom they represented, and for whom they stood, were back home and out of sight of the image and out of reach of the sound of the music. The king knew that his faithful rulers were submissive and obedient to his commandment, and as rulers of his organization he would expect them to keep the people in subjection. Now the command of Satan’s &quot;herald” is, since J 938, to the visible rulers of the world, and they are expected to obey and keep the people in subjection to their commands; and the rulers put forth their strongest endeavors to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> A kind of hypnotic mass was performed on the plain of Dura before that image; and so now likewise the &quot;hypnotic mass” is performed by Satan and his representatives on the earth before his organization. The Devil’s organization is threatened with complete downfall, and, sensing this danger, he assembles his representatives, and his herald cries out to the peoples of the world, even as Nebuchadnezzar’s herald cried out, to wit: &quot;That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, Hute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.” (Dan, 3: 5) A pleasant, outwardly agreeable and soothing tone is given on this occasion of mass worship, pictured by the use of the concert orchestra, which would have a tendency to awe and soothe the worshiper's. Even so after Satan was east out of heaven he attempted to soothe, awe and muse a worshipful feeling amongst his earthly representatives that they might reverentially bow before him and his organized power. The dedication of Satan’s organization after it was cast out of heaven would give rebirth or recovery and reconstruction of that organization which had received such a dreadful jolt when Christ threw it out of heaven and down to the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Following the ‘birth of the man child’, that is to say, the birth or beginning of the kingdom, Christ Jesus the King did cast Satan out of heaven, and there was great rejoicing in heaven, doubtless accompanied by exquisite and incomparable music, because it is written concerning the same: &quot;Rejoice, yc heavens, and yc that dwell in them.” The &quot;last trump” of God was then sounding and ‘there were heard the voices of harpers harping with their harps, and they sung as it were a new song’. (Rev, 14:2,3) Satan always tries to imitate God, because Satan is a mimic god; hence he tries to have the dedication of his organization accompanied by music.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Knowing that he must keep all honest ones in the dark, and being the archdeceiver, the Devil would try to have the manifestation and dedication of his organization and his worship carried on as joyfully amongst the people as possible. Even though it is a time of great “woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea” which the Devil himself has brought upon the people, yet he would have his religious representatives, the clergy, explain to the people that sueh woe is punishment sent upon them by Jehovah God, and hence if they wanted to have joy and pleasure they must look to Satan and his organization for the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> As Nebuchadnezzar the representative of Satan had a great band of music to perform on the plain of Dura at the dedication of the golden image, so now the Devil would have a manifestation of his organization attended by that which would soothe the people into silence mid hypnotize them and cause them to strike an attitude of formal worship. So the Devil produced a great band composed of many musical instruments. Of those instruments that are employed by Satan in his optimism-spreading, nationalisminspiring, dream-producing music-makers to produce cheer and enforced worship, arc these: The League of Nations multitoned horn, the Disarmament cornet, the Economic Monetary Conference Hute, the “New Deal” harp, the technocracy saekbut, the National Economy League psaltery, the “back-to-the-chureh” musical saw, the “holy year” saxophone, the peace pact dulcimer, the big navy bass horn, and a multitude of other wind-jamming instruments, bones, sticks, and drums of up-to-date, ami all jazz instruments, operated to the dedication of the Devil’s organization; and the whole thing makes a terrible noise. Every tune played by this orchestra is out of harmony with the music of God’s kingdom, but in modern times the people, as a general rule, willingly take to jazz. For fear the song of the kingdom might be heard Satan commands that his agents, and particular!}&quot; the clergy of the religious part of his organization, shall have the exclusive use of the radio by which to instruct the people in matters of religious worship. Then he puts the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and their so-called “priests”, and the misnamed “Protestant” preachers and the Jewish rabbis in the lead and causes them to shout to the people: ‘Follow the light back to our god [meaning, of course, Satan, the god of this world] ; this is the only light there is.’ The preachers now openly deny God's Word, substitute “science so called” for the same, and expect to control the people by their jazz. The deluded ones fall down and worship before the Devil’s organization. But not so with those who serve God. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego refused to fall down before the image of gold; and the remnant of God on earth now refuse to fall down before any part of Satan's organization and worship it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> Who caused the image to be set up? The scripture reads: “Ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.” So it is the king that erected the image, and it is the king that commands the worship; and the king represents the Devil. Therefore the question is: Shall we be submissive to the higher powers, meaning, of course, the king and his official family? To refuse to obey the king's command would be a challenge to the king’s supremacy and to the legitimacy of the image erected by him. That would mean, then, that the king is the one who determines what and when the people shall worship, and that his power is supreme, and that the people must hear, obey and worship whatsoever the king commands them to obey and worship. Applying the picture, then, to the present time, it means that the Devil would compel all the people of earth to worship him and his organization either directly or indirectly, and to thus reproach the name of Jehovah, the great Being, who is supreme above all. Tl:e question of supremacy is brought to the fore, and Satan boldly claims that he is supreme; therefore everyone is forced to take his stand either on the side of the. Devil or on the side of Jehovah ami his kingdom. The visible part of Satan’s organization today insist that the power of the state is supreme and that everyone must be submissive thereto regardless of whether the rule promulgated is contrary to God's law or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> There was no effort on the part of King Nebuchadnezzar to render good and blessings to the people. The primary thing was to cause the people to obey him in matters of worship; and in doing this he was fully supported by all the officials of his realm. It is even so today with the Devil and his representatives. As it was declared by the king’s messenger on the plain of Dura, so now the visible messengers of the Devil declare: “And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall the same hour be east into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.” (Dan. 3: fi) Anyone refusing to fall down and worship would thereby declare that some other ruler is supreme and henee worthy to be worshiped in spirit and in truth, and that the king’s image is fraudulent and a counterfeit. So it was in Nebuchadnezzar's time, and even so it is today. Those who refuse to join with the religious combine and worship in the place and in the manner the Devil’s organization has arranged are considered to be enemies of the nation and worthy to be destroyed, which was symbolized by the easting of the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace. Those who now stand firm for God and his kingdom and worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth and refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization thereby declare that this worldly organization ruled by Satan and his agents is a fraudulent, counterfeit thing operating to the reproach of Jehovah's name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup>Why should the decree of Nebuchadnezzar consign to the crucible or fiery furnace all who refused to bow down to the image’’ Not for the purpose of purifying or refining them or making them better, but for the sole purpose of destroying them. Such is the policy also pursued by Satan and his representatives today. The king of Babylon did roast Ahab in the fire, and now the Devil’s crowd would roast anyone in the fire who does not obey them. (Jer. 29: 21, 22) The furnace employed by Nebuchadnezzar was made to destroy the creature; so now the purpose of Satan is to destroy. But Satan and his agents can only “kill the body’’. God’s faithful witnesses know this, and they know that the furnace or fiery crucible is employed for the purpose of breaking down their integrity toward God and thus to lead them to complete destruction. By the grace of the Lord God they remain true and faithful to Jehovah, and he saves them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The furnace of Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, foreshadowed the hot and crucial tests or conditions of natural discomfort, such as threats upon the lives of the Lord’s faithful ones, bodily assaults upon them by the strong-arm squad, incarceration of the faithful in prisons, newspaper “roasts”, abuse by the clergy, decrees unjustly entered and enforced by the law department of Satan’s organization, and the public branding of all of Jehovah's witnesses as enemies and as the offseouring of the earth. All such crucial or fiery treatment Jehovah permits to come upon his people now to te st their integrity. The enemy attempts to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, and may succeed in killing the organism of some, but God’s promised protection is to those who remain faithful to him. The Word of God makes it sure that he will have some of the remnant on earth at the final show-down and, even though some of them may be killed by the Devil’s crowd, the remnant as a class will survive and persist. It must be expected that the hottest part of this fire, or crucible experience, will be just prior to the battle of Armageddon. It may even appear that the case of Jehovah’s witnesses is all cooked up when Gog and his hordes will have invaded the land of Jehovah’s people to spoil them, but God will furnish the protection. The act of Gog will cause the Lord’s fury to come up into his face, and then shall follow the destruction of the enemy, to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.—Ezek. 38: 8-18; 39:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The Devil with his visible officers on the plain of Dura swept everyone into line and caused them to bow down, the only exception being the faithful Judeans. “Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbnt, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.” (Dan. 3:7) Every man then holding a job owed his position and salary to the king; hence selfishness of such men and the fear of a creature induced all of them to worship in the Devil’s appointed manner. The Devil gave the king Nebuchadnezzar his power; hence the king represented the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> In like conditions now existing the official element of the world, religious, political and commercial, do the king’s bidding, for they owe everything they have or expect to have to the visible organized power; and hence they bow down to the Devil’s organization, who has given his beastly power to his representatives that rule on the earth, and all of these continue now to shout out: 'Who is like unto the beast [these great rulers] ? and who is able to make war with them?’ (Rev. 13:2-4) And the rulers and their immediate supporters continue to chant: ‘The earth is ours, and we will rule it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2,:</sup> The tin•ee faithful Judeans, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, refused to fall down and worship the image; hence they were accused of breaking the law; and it was the priestly or religious class that did the accusing of these faithful men: “Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.” (Dan. 3:8) Having in mind that Daniel wrote this record at a time when the term “Chaldean” had come to have a restricted meaning throws light upon this prophecy as to the accusers. The term “Chaldean”, instead of applying to the people of a certain province, was made to identify a certain class of men serving the king. Daniel, though a Jew, was made master of the “astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers” by the king. (Dan. 5:11) It was necessary for those composing that class to learn the language of the Chaldeans. (Dan. 1:4) The Chaldeans were the learned class, and doubtless all of the priests were required to be of that class, just as the priests of the. Roman Catholic,, hierarchy today are required to he of the learned class. Those learned men were priests, magicians, astrologers, scientists, and soothsayers, and they were the ones that accused the three faithful Hebrews. Those accusers correspond to the moderntime clergy ch.ss, the learned Chaldeans, priests and soothsayers, so-called “scientists”, who hate the faithful witnesses of Jehovah because these wifnesas tell the truth and sing Jehovah’s praise. It is this priestly or clergy' class that today, operating behind the screens, cause the arrest, persecution and imprisonment of Jehovah’s witnesses. The word “accused” used in the foregoing text also translates two Hebrew words, to wit: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">akal,</span><span class="font3"> meaning to “eat up ” or “devour”, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kerats,</span><span class="font3"> meaning a “bit”; hence literally meaning “to chew up” (figuratively) by slandering or false accusations. According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font3"> marginal reading the text says: “Did eat their pieces of.”—Dan. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> The action of the wicked accusers against the three Hebrew men finds a parallel in the present time. Today it is the clergy that bring accusations against Jehovah’s witnesses and that incite the political officials to take action against them. In Canada it w.ts the clergy that filed accusations with the Canadian radio commission demanding that the message of the truth be excluded from the air. In the United States it is the clergy that bring all manner of false accusation against Jehovah’s witnesses and use every known wrongful means to induce the Federal radio commission to prevent the message of truth from being broadcast by radio. It is the clergy, beaded by the pope, of every nation of “Christendom” that today make false accusation against Jehovah’s witnesses and that thereby cause Jehovah’s witnesses to be hated of all nations for the reason they are witnesses to the name of Jehovah and his King. (Matt. 24:9) With words of flattery these clergymen appear before the political ruling element and say to them: ‘0 rulers, live for ever.’ (Dan. 3:9) Thus they appear to be loyal and looking for the best interests of the country, when they are doing the very worst thing for the peoples’ interests.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> These modern “Chaldeans”, or learned clergymen, arc sticklers for law enforcement whenever that serves their purpose. It was so in Nebuchadnezzar’s day, and it is so now; hence this prophecy: “Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, saekbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.”—Dan. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> These accusers invoke laws made by creatures which are both selfish.and God-defying and ignore and spurn the law made by the Creator, whose name alone is Jehovah. With fraudulent and pious faces they strike an attitude of great disgust concerning Jehovah's witnesses and insist on their punishment because such witnesses arc calling attention to Jehovah and his kingdom and because these faithful ones refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The Chaldeans who brought accusation were coerced by fear of men to do so, also by a selfish desire to make themselves appear as exceedingly good; hence they sought the punishment of all those who did not then bow down; and likewise now they seek the punishment of those who do not bow down to Satan’s organization. The clergy claim to want what is “within the law”, that is to say, the law of men, but they disregard the law of God. The Chaldeans repeated before the king the substance of his decree and then pointed out the faithful Judeans who refused to obey his decree: “And whoso falleth not down and worshipped, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. There arc certain Jews, whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, 0 king, have not regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.”—Dan. 3:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The Chaldeans wanted to “get” those Jews, because they hated them and they hated the favors which the Jews had enjoyed up to that time. They made it appear that such Judeans were ungrateful to the king. Even so today the clergy bring to the attention of the law-enforcement bodies that Jehovah's witnesses are ungrateful and are violators of the law of the land, even by faithfully performing the law of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Nebuchadnezzar himself had found these Hebrews, including Daniel, to be “ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all,his realm” in matters of learning and wisdom. (Dan. 1: 20) Likewise today the political rulers well know that Jehovah’s witnesses are ten times better informed and wiser concerning the Word of God than all the clergy in the land, but, notwithstanding this, they all conclude that they must hang together, fearing that otherwise they might hang separately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> As the clergy accused the three Hebrews in Daniel’s time, even so now that same class accuse Jehovah's witnesses, saying: “These men, 0 king, have not regarded thee [nor the law of the land) ; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” Jehovah’s witnesses do not serve the Devil, nor regard the things demanded by ■Satan’s organization which contravene God’s law. They will have Jehovah first, last, and all the time. Since the time of the Detroit convention, in 1928, when the Declaration was issued against Satan and in favor of Jehovah, these faithful witnesses laid the responsibility for the present world distress at Satan’s door, where it properly belongs. They refuse to have any part in the devilish formalism of worldly worship. They serve and worship Jehovah God. They know that the religious elements sacrifice hypocritically and when they do sacrifice they do it to devils, and hence Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to have anything in common with them. The remnant know that they cannot receive the Lord’s protection unless the}' are faithful to him. They cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table and of the Devil’s table at the same time.—1 Cor. 10:20,21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> It is true that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to have any part in the so-called “holy year” fiasco, because they know that God has not authorized the Homan Catholic organization, or any other organization, to proclaim a holy year. They refuse to conform to the political religions promulgated and practiced by trie earthly, worldly leaders, and hence they do not bow down to the image of gold. Unwilling to compromise with the Devil, and to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name, the faithful remnant hate the Devil’s gilded organization, represented by the golden image, because God hates it. (Prov. 6:16) Jehovah’s witnesses are for God and his kingdom, and gladly say: “Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. I hate and abhor lying; but thy law do I love.” (Ps. 119:128,163) Satan’s powers, including his visible agents, reproach Jehovah’s name. Jehovah hates them, and those who are on Jehovah’s side likewise hate them. “Do not 1 hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.” —Ps. 139:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>83</sup> In 1929 the Lord made clearly to appear to his people who constitute “the higher powers”, and since then they have been enabled to see clearly that the faithful ones must obey Jehovah and Christ Jesus, who are “the higher powers”, and make no compromise with the wicked organization that rules the world, and which powers are not ordained of God. Jehovah’s witnesses have no inclination to violate any law of the land, and will not do so when that law is in harmony with God’s law; but they will be guided by God’s law and obey his law and trust wholly in him, regardless of results. For this reason the clergy continuously and persistently accuse Jehovah’s witnesses before the political ruling power of the world; and this they do because they are in a conspiracy, led by Satan’s agent Gog, to bring about the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses.—I’s. 83:2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What took place before Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura foreshadowed the wrath of the Devil in this day against Jehovah’s witnesses, (Bev. 12:17) The king then was angry, and so now the Devil is<sup>1</sup> exceedingly angry. ’“Then Nebuchadnezzar, in his rage and fury, commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.” (Dan. 3; 13) Evidently Nebuchadnezzar used bis strong-arm squad to bring in the three faithful Hebrews before him. So likewise today, wherever Jehovah's witness's are brought before the courts it is Satan who is behind the move, and his purpose is to break the courage of Jehovah’s witnesses and to cause them to fail to maintain their integrity toward God. It is the strong-arm squad that hales these faithful ones into court. The great issue raised by Satan's challenge to Jehovah is the question that is now being fought out. The Devil expects now to use pressure on Jehovah’s witnesses to cause them to forsake the path of integrity and thus to make it appear that any creature that serves Jehovah God is prompted by selfishness or what the creature may get out of it from God. Jehovah now shows these truths to his remnant that they may receive comfort and know that they are pursuing the right course, and, continuing therein, they may have strong hope that they wdl win. What, then, does the Word of God foretell will be the final outcome to those who are and who will be in the crucible or fiery test?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PURPOSE OF GATHERING THE SAINTS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font3">N HIS book, the Bible, is presented the purpose of the Almighty Creator in gathering out from among the peoples of earth, during a long period of time, a company of individuals who now stand forth and move in united action as Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The period of time occupied for the selection of the members of the body of Christ, called “saints”, embraces the time from Pentecost, A.D. 33, to the setting up of God's kingdom. That period of time is properly called the Christian era or period of sacrifice, because it is the time of the selection and development of the true Christians who werg taken into the covenant with God by sacrifice. Nearing the end of that period the time comes for bringing these faithful ones out from, and separating them from, the denominational church systems and gathering them unto God. When that time arrives Jehovah commands: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”—Ps. 50:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who are the saints within the meaning of this text? Manifestly those who are wholly devoted to God and are therefore godly creatures. It is that class spoken of by<sup>r</sup> the prophet when he said: &quot;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.&quot; (Ps. 116:15) Not everyone who makes a covenant by sacrifice proves faithful, and hence not everyone making a covenant by sacrifice is embraced within the class that is ‘the people taken out for Ills name’. Only the faithful ones are the saints of God, and it is of such that Jehovah speaks in Psalm 50: 5. &quot;Saints&quot; does not mean those whom the clergy have canonized, and to whom many ignorantly pray; nor does the term apply to those ordinarily called holy, but to those only who are in Christ Jesus by begetting, adoption and anointing. It could not embrace those such as Jews according to the flesh who were, brought into the covenant with God by the sacrifice of animals and fowls, but means those who are in the covenant by sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the Scriptures it appears that the gathering is done at Jehovah’s command and by the Lord Jesus together with his holy angels. &quot;The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. . . . He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.&quot; (Ps. 50:1-4) Clearly the gathering of the saints unto Jehovah takes place when the Lord Jesus comes to the temple and puts his professed people to the test. The approved ones are gathered unto the Lord by being brought into the temple condition and builded up as a part of God’s organization, Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet indicates the time when the gathering of the saints would begin. In the above text it is stated: “Themighty God . . . hath spoken . . . from the rising of the sun.” The Lord Jesus spoke of the manner of his return and likened it unto the sun rising in the east. Jesus spoke a parable to the effect that the true saints and the false representatives of the Lord would grow' together in the same field (the world) until the time of the harvest, which time would mark his second presence (Matt. 13: 39) Many consecrated ones were in denominational church systems called “Babylon&quot; until that time. They were looking for the second coming of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet foretold the sentiments of their hearts when he wrote: &quot;When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.&quot;— Ps. 126:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet of God says: &quot;He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth.” Jehovah is spoken of as &quot;him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice&quot;. (Ps. GS: 33) His great executive officer in the heavens is Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah calls upon him to begin the work of gathering his saints together. This harmonizes with the beginning of the Lord’s presence at the temple, from 1918 onward. He calls to earth; that is to say, he turns his attention to things on the earth and issues his command for the gathering. In gathering unto himself the remnant and those with whom he had been angry and turning his anger away from them in 1919, as foretold in Isaiah 12:1, Jehovah there began the fulfilment of the prophecy of Psalm 50:5. Thereafter the Lord began gathering God’s faithful remnant by sending forth his angels to gather the elect from the four winds and from one end of heaven to the other. (Matt. 24:31) The &quot;four winds” and &quot;heaven&quot; seem to be used symbolically to testify to the fact that the gathering is a universal one from all parts of the land where there arc those who arc devoted to God. He has called the true Christians out from all church denominations and all connection with Satan’s organization and gathered them together in the bonds of truth, in the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of the gathering is stated to be &quot;that he may judge his people&quot;. (Ps. 50:4) &quot;Judgment must begin at the house of God.&quot; (1 Pet. 4:17) Jesus spoke a parable concerning his return and the taking of account with those to whom he had committed the kingdom interests. (Matt. 25:14-30) Manifestly then the purpose is to bring his people together and give them such knowledge of God’s purpose that they might be judged and tested. Mark how the physical facts fit the prophetic words. During the period of time from about 1875 to 1918 Christ, the great Messenger of heaven, he who is Priest of the Most High God, was preparing the way before Jehovah; and then, the preparation thereof being accomplished, he suddenly or promptly comes to his temple. (Mal. 3:1) The temple is made up of the anointed ones of God. (2 Cor. 6:16) He comes for the purpose of judgment, that the approved ones may offer unto the Lord an offering (service of praise) in righteousness. He makes clear the truth to those gathered ones that they may continue to offer sacrifices of praise unto the Lord and to do this in harmony with his will. The Lord sits as a refiner to try, test and refine those whom the sons of Levi foreshadowed.—Mal. 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the period of time elapsing from Pentecost until the second-coming of the Lord many persons have heard the gospel of truth and believed and made a consecration to do the will of God. These have been reconciled and fully justified and taken into the covenant by sacrifice. Not all of such have remained faithful unto the Lord, however. In fact, the greater number have been unfaithful to God. The chief responsibility’ for such unfaithfulness lies at the door of the clergy. The people have looked to the clergy as their spiritual advisers. These men claiming to represent God and to speak with authority, the people for a long while received their statements as true. The clergy’ have led the people in the wrong way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only have the clergy participated in the politics of this evil world, but they have resorted to all the wicked tricks of politics. They have schemed for position and advantage and have used their high and influential office as clergymen to accomplish their selfish purposes. The politics of this world are under the supervision and control of Satan, its god. (2 Cor. 4: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4)</span><span class="font3"> The clergy have allied themselves with the god of this world and have induced great numbers of Christians to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus in plain phrase stated that his kingdom is not of this world, but that his kingdom was future from the time he was on earth and that it would bo set up only at his second coming and the taking of his power. (John 18: 36) The clergy were not content to be the followers of Jesus, but have run ahead of the Lord and claimed it to be their commission and duty to set up the Lord’s kingdom on earth in advance of God’s time. To this end they have opened their doors and their arms and welcomed to their fold the profiteers, the politicians and the oppressors of the people. They have brought in these powerful men to the end that their church systems might be more powerful and more influential. These profiteers and oppressors have become the principal ones in their flocks, wielding the power and influence of the organization. One error of Ihe clergy led to another until, fearing to oppose the powerful and influential ones of their congregations, they have repudiated the Bible and have told the people to bcl'eve anything that they wanted to believe, just so they remained in the chureh organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy have advocated war and urged the people to engage in the wholesale murder of their fellow creatures. They have used their church edifices as recruiting stations. They have gone so far in their blasphemous course that they have told the young men to enlist in the war and that if they should die upon the battlefield their death there would be a guarantee that they would be taken immediately to heaven and counted in as a part of the great sacrifice of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The influence of the clergy has led the great mass of professing Christians away from full devotion to the Lord and has caused them to mix with the world. To the people they have misrepresented the truth and have opposed God’s witnesses in an effort to give the people the truth. By threats and coercion the clergy have held back a great many timid chureh people from hearing the truth. So desperate have they been that they have willfully misrepresented God’s purpose and have influenced their parishioners to close their eyes and ears to the hearing of the message of truth. When God’s command came to gather together his saints who had made a covenant with him by sacrifice the clergy used all their power and influence to prevent such gathering. They have succeeded in turning millions away from the Lord and his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be sure, the clergy are not of those who are gathered unto the Lord. Nor are those consecrated ones who have permitted themselves to be held back from God and his truth by the influence of the clergy, of the class that is gathered unto the Lord. Those so-called Christians who love God and have been held back by reason of the influence of the clergy or held as &quot;prisoners”, within the meaning of the Scriptures (1’ss. 79:11; 102:20), have cried unto the Lord. Under their covenant by sacrifice they are appointed to a sacrificial death; but, having been held back from faithfulness by the influence of their prison-keepers, the clergy, the time comes when they cry unto the Lord. Concerning this the prophet says: &quot;Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die.” (I’s. 79:11) God hears their cries and the time comes for him to release them.— I’s. 102: 19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All wIio have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice have been offered the great privilege of being witnesses to the majesty and loving-kindness of God and to the outworking of liis great purpose for the reconciliation of man. Of and concerning himself, the chief One, Jesus said: &quot;To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth, livery one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) What is true of Jesus applies to all those who are taken into the covenant by sacrifice. Each one of such not only is granted the privilege of hearing the truth, but is offered the opportunity to be a witness to the truth. The only' way whereby such can be true, loyal and faithful unto God is to be witnesses to the truth as opporlunily affords. The Lord sees to it that such have opportunities. A witness is one who gives testimony'. The testimony concerning God and his purpose for the vindication of his holy name and for the reconciliation of man must be given, and it is his will to have it given by his anointed when they are gathered together to the temple during the second presence of the Lord.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ECCLESIASTICISM INDICTED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">O</span><span class="font3">N JULY 26, in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-four, a multitude of Christian people, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, who had separated themselves from all the religions denominations and taken their stand firmly for the Lord Jehovah, passed a resolution in the form of an indictment against the ecclesiastical element as constituting a part of the Devil’s organization. This indictment so clearly sets forth the truth of the situation before the minds of the people that it is here quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We, . . . in convention assembled, declare our unqualified allegiance to Christ, who is now present and setting up his kingdom, and to that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We believe that every anointed child of God is an ambassador for Christ and is duty-bound to give a faithful and true witness on behalf of his kingdom. As ambassadors for Christ, and without assuming any self-righteousness, we believe and hold that God has commissioned us to ‘proclaim the day of vengeance of our God and to comfort all that mourn’.—Isa. 61: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We believe and hold that it is God’s due time for his displeasure to be expressed against wicked systems that have blinded the people to the truth and have thereby deprived them of peace and hope; ami to the end that the people might know the truth and receive some comfort and hope for future blessings wc present this indictment, based upon the Word of God, and point to the divine provision as the remedy for man's complete relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We present and charge that Satan formed a conspiracy for the purpose of keeping the people in ignorance of God’s provision for blessing them with life, liberty and happiness; and that others, to wit, unfaithful preachers, conscienceless profiteers, and unscrupulous politicians, have entered into said conspiracy, either willingly or unwillingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“That unfaithful preachers have formed themselves into ecclesiastical systems, consisting of councils, synods, presbyteries, associations, and so forth, and have designated themselves therein as popes, cardinals, bishops, doctors of divinity, pastors, shepherds, reverends, and so on, and elected themselves to such offices, which aggregation is herein designated as ‘the clergy’; and that these have willingly made commercial giants and professional politicians the principal ones of their flocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We present and charge that the clergy have yielded to the temptations presented to them by Satan and, contrary to God’s Word, have joined in said conspiracy, and in furtherance thereof have committed the overt acts as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(1) That they have used their spiritual powers, enjoyed by reason of their position, to gratify their own selfish desires by feeding and exalting themselves and failing and refusing to feed or teach the people God’s Word of Truth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(2) That, loving the glory of this world, and desiring to shine before men and have the approve<sup>1</sup> of men (Luke 4:8; Jas. 4:4; 1 John 2:15), they have clothed themselves in gaudy apparel, decked themselves with jewels, and have assumed a form of godliness while denying God’s Word and the pov'er thereof ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(3) That they have failed and refused to preach to the people the message of Messiah’s kingdom and to point them to the evidences relating to his second coming; and being unwilling to await the Lord’s due time to set up his kingdom, and being ambitious to appear wise and great, they have, together with their coconspirators, claimed the ability to set up God’s kingdom on earth without God, and have endorsed the League of Nations and declared it to be ‘the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’, thereby breaking their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and declaring their allegiance to the Devil, the god of evil; and to ‘his end they have advocated ami sanctified war, turned their church edifices into recruiting stations, acted as recruiting officers for pay, and preached men into the trenches, there to suffer and die; and when the Lord presentee] to them the clear and indisputable proof that the old world has ended and that his kingdom is at hand, they have scoffed at and rejected the testimony, and have persecuted, arrested and caused the imprisonment of witnesses of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DOCTRINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We further present and charge that the clergy as a class have constituted themselves the fountain of doctrines which, in the furtherance of said conspiracy, they have sent forth to the people, claiming such doctrines to be the teachings of God's Word, well knowing the same to be untrue, in this, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(1) That they falsely claim to be the divinely appointed successors to the inspired apostles of Jesus Christ; whereas the Scriptures clearly show that there are no successors to the Lord’s apostles;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(2) That they claim the sole right to interpret the Scriptures, and that therefore they alone know what the people should believe, and bj- this means they have kept the people in ignorance of the Bible; and now in the time of increased knowledge and much reading, when the people might read and understand, these self-constituted ‘successors to the apostles’ discourage the people from reading the Bible and Bible literature, deny the inspiration of the Scriptures, teach evolution, and by these means turn the minds of the people away from God and his Word of truth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(3) That they have taught and teach the divine right of kings to rule the peoples, claiming such rule to be the kingdom of God on earth; they hold that they and the principal of their flocks are commissioned of God to direct the policy and course of the nations, and that if the people do not submissively concur in such policies then the people are unpatriotic or disloyal;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ (4) That they are the authors of the unreasonable</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and false doctrine of the trinity, by which they claim and teach that Jehovah, Jesus and the holy spirit are three persons in one, which fallacy they admit cannot be understood or explained; that this false doctrine has blinded the people to the true meaning of the great ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, through which men can be saved;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ (5) That they teach and have taught the false doctrine of human immortality; that is to say, that all men are created immortal souls, which cannot die; which doctrine they well know to be false, for it is based exclusively upon the statement of Satan, which statement Jesus declares to be a great lie (John 8:44) ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(G) That they preach and teach the doctrine of eternal torment; that is to say, that the penalty for sin is conscious torment in hell, eternal in duration; whereas they know that the Bible teaches that the wages of sin is death; that hell is the state of death or the tomb; that the dead arc unconscious until the resurrection, and that the ransom sacrifice is provided that all in due time may have an opportunity to believe and obey the Lord and live, while the willfully wicked arc to be punished with an everlasting destruction;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(7) That they deny the right of the Lord to establish his kingdom on earth, well knowing that Jesus taught that he would come again at the end of the world, and that the fact of that time would be made known by the nations of ‘Christendom’ engaging in a world war, quickly followed by famine, pestilence, revolutions, the return of God’s favor to the Jews [inwardly such], distress and perplexity of the nations; and that during such time the God of heaven would set up his kingdom, which will stand for ever (Dan. 2:44); that ignoring and refusing to consider these plain truths and evidences, they have willingly gone on in darkness, together with their allies, profiteers and politicians, in an attempt to set up a world power for the purpose of ruling and keeping the people in subjection, all of which is contrary to the Word of God and against his dignity and good name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The doctrines taught by the clergy and their course of action herein stated are admitted; and upon the undisputed facts and upon the law of God’s Word they stand confessedly guilty before God and in the eyes of the world upon every charge in this indictment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Upon the authority of the prophecy of God’s Word now being fulfilled, we declare that this is the day of God’s wrath upon ‘Christendom’; and that he stands in the midst of the mighty and controlling factors of the world, to wit, the clergy and the principal of their flocks, to judge and to express his righteous indignation against them and their unrighteous systems and doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We further declare that the only hope for the peace and happiness of the peoples of earth is Messiah’s kingdom, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Therefore we call upon the peoples and nations of earth to witness that the statements here made arc true; and in order that the people might, in this time of perplexity and distress, have hope and comfort, wc urge upon them prayerful and diligent study’ of the Bible, that they might learn therefrom that God through Christ and his kingdom has a complete and adequate provision for the blessing of mankind upon earth with peace and prosperity, liberty, happiness and eternal life, and that his kingdom is at hand.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These facts are set forth here, not for the purpose of holding men up to ridicule, but for the purpose of informing the people that the ecclesiastical systems, Catholic and Protestant, are under the supervision and control of the Devil and form a part of his visible organization, and therefore constitute an antichrist. This is true for the reason that they parade under the name and title of Christian, while such claim, in the light of the foregoing facts, is absolutely false. They call themselves by the name of the Lord, but in truth and in fact they represent the Devil. 'Pho hypocrisy that began away back in the days of Adam’s grandson Enos has become so flagrant in this present day that all who have an open mind can see it.—Gen. 4:26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has pleased the Lord God to prepare the members of his empire or kingdom, now at hand, under adverse conditions on earth.' Kcal Christians have never been popular with the world. During ihe entire period of the Christian era they have suffered much persecution. They have been counted as the offscour-ing amongst men. From what source could we reasonably expect persecution and adversity upon the Christians? From the Devil and his organization, of course; because God declared in Eden that there would be enmity between the seed of the woman, which seed is the empire class, and the seed of the serpent, which is the Devil’s organization. We arc not left in doubt as to who constitutes the seed or children of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was on earth those who persecuted him were the scribes, Pharisees and priests, together composing the clergy of that day and claiming to be representatives of God. They were hypocrites. Jesus said they were. That class exalted themselves, even as the clergy do today. They posed as men of great righteousness. To them Jesus said: “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrifis! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater [condemnation].’’ (Matt. 23:13,14) These same hypocrites claimed to be the sons of God; but Je.sus plainly said to them: “Ye arc of your father the devil. ’ ’—John 8:42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a period in the history of the world known as ‘the time of the Inquisition’. It was in that period of time that the ecclesiastical courts were organized in certain countries, and men were haled before these tribunals and charged with the crime of heresy. They were put through a mock trial and subjected to all manner of wicked torture to compel them to confess a senseless creed. Who was responsible for this cruel treatment of Christians? The clergy, who claimed to be the representatives of God and of Christ, but who in truth and in fact represented the Devil. They were hypocrites. Such persecution was not confined to the Papal system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In due course the Protestants resorted to like persecution. Call to mind the reformation leader John Calvin, the father of the Presbyterians, who signed the death warrant of Servetus and had him slowly burned to death at the stake because he did not agree with the so-called “orthodox” doctrines of that ecclesiastical system. All the wicked persecution that has been inflicted upon Christ Jesus and his followers has been done by the clergy or at the instigation of the clergy, who hypocritically claim to represent the God of love and his beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Dragon, the Devil, the father of these ecclesiastical systems, was the real inducing cause for such persecution. These ecclesiastical systems, particularly the clergy and the principal of their flocks, arc and ever have been a part of the world which is under the control of Satan the enemy. These have taught conflicting doctrines and have fought amongst themselves, until someone would come forward with the truth of God's Word; then they combine under the direction of their father the Devil to fight against the representative of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very fittingly and justly, therefore, the prophetic Word of God solemnly declares that ecclesiasticism is doomed shortly to go into utter destruction in disgrace.</span></p>

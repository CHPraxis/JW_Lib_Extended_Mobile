<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS COVENANTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.”—Ps. 50: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH GOD is the Giver of life, and his provisions for men to obtain life are by and through the merit of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice. “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) No one gets life by reason of being in a covenant. A man must first be justified and counted righteous before he could be brought into the new covenant. He is by reason of faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus counted thereafter as having the right to life. But once being taken into the new covenant means that he must keep the terms of that covenant in order to live and escape eternal death. The Israelites were under the law covenant when Jehovah said to them: “Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.” (Lev. 18:5) That scripture does not saj’ and docs not mean that the Jews would obtain life by reason of being in the covenant, but it means that the breaking of the law covenant meant a cessation of the life they had at that time. They must live in the covenant. Relative to the same matter it is written: “For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that con-tinueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font4"> them.” (Gal. 3:10-12) During the thousand-year reign of Christ he will regenerate the obedient ones of mankind, not by or according to the terms of the new covenant, but by reason of their obedience to the laws of his kingdom. Those who have been produced by the new covenant as a people for Jehovah’s name, and who continue faithful unto death, will then sit with Christ Jesus in that work of regeneration. (Rev. 2:10; Matt. 19:28) The new covenant is specifically for the purpose of dealing with the justified and spirit-begotten ones that those who continue faithful to the terms of the covenant may be produced and prepared as witnesses to the name of Jehovah and bear testimony to his name. When those in the covenant have been brought to the unity of the faith in Christ Jesus, “unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,” it is then that the new covenant is inaugurated toward them and they are made official witnesses of Jehovah; and their work as such witnesses must be done before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UNTO ZION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul was addressing those in Christ Jesus in the new covenant when he wrote: “But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels. ” (Heb. 12:22) He did not say, Ye are come to Egypt, or to any part of Satan’s organization, but, “Ye arc come unto mount Sion,” which is God’s organization, and means the establishment of the kingdom of God. The building up of Zion, the capital organization of Jehovah, began when the words of Jehovah were fulfilled, to wit, “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) The Lord Jesus Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, then straightway came to the temple; and this ‘coming unto Zion’ is completed with the bringing of the remnant into the opened temple of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The “city of the living God” is the heavenly Jerusalem, which has now ‘descended out of heaven’ (Rev. 21:1,2) to take charge of the world by its rightful ruler Christ Jesus and to vindicate the name of Jehovah. A company of angels attended upon the occasion of this ‘coming’ and participated in the inauguration ceremonies. According to other renderings of the text these are “myriads of angels, a full assembly” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Ding.);</span><span class="font4"> “myriads of messengers in high festival.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Hath.)</span><span class="font4"> It is at the coming of the Lord to the temple for judgment that his angels accompany him and when he gathers unto himself those who are in the covenant, and who up to that time had demonstrated their faithfulness. (Matt. 25:31) “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming [to the temple] of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.” There were angels participating in the inauguration of the old law covenant; as it is written: “It was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator [Moses].” (Gal. 3:19) The angels delivered God’s message with authority from him, and God did not permit any disobedience to the message which he caused these angels to transmit. (Heb. 2:2) The words spoken by the angels were spoken to the Israelites assembled before Mount Sinai at the inauguration of the law eovenant and who wore already in the covenant which had been made with them in Egypt, and which people were designated by the Scriptures as “the church” (that is, a selected or gathered-ont people), because they were a people gathered out for .Jehovah’s name. “This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">yu</span><span class="font4"> hear. This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers; who received the lively oracles to give unto us.”—Acts 7: 37, 38.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">147</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* At the inauguration of the new covenant, says the scripture, “ye arc come unto . . . [the; church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven.” (lie!). 12:22,23) Truly the names of these are enrolled in heaven since Zion L-.s brought forth her children, and their citizenship is in heaven. The faithful saints who long ego died in faith have first been resurrected and gathered to Zion, and those remaining on earth are now ‘caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air’. (1 Tiiess. 4:17) (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtoiccr,</span><span class="font4"> January 15, 1934.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Further the scripture identifies the time of the inauguration of the new covenant, when he says: “And to God [Jehovah] the Judge of all.” (Heb. 12:23) Jehovah is the Judge over all, and his judgment first begins at the house of God when Christ Jesus, the duly appointed Judge, there appears and begins judgment for the purpose of purifying the sons of Levi. (Mal. 3:3; 1 Pct. 4:17; Jas. 4:12) That judgment determines who shall be approved and anointed to offer unto God an offering in righteousness. (Heb. 13:15) The church of the firstborn in this text, which are gathered unto God, does not include the ‘great company’ class, but the limitation is to those only who form the royal house of Jehovah and toward whom the covenant is inaugurated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Then says the scripture: ‘ ‘ And to the spirits of just men made perfect.” Who are “the spirits of just men made perfect”? In the Greek word-for-word rendering of this text the word “men” does not appear, but it reads: “And to spirits of the righteous made perfect.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diag.)</span><span class="font4"> “And unto the spirits of righteous ones made perfect”; in the margin, “perfected righteous ones.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> The word “perfected” modifies “righteous ones”, and not “spirits”. The ones to whom this part of the text applies are not creatures with a spirit organism, but it applies to the faithful men on earth. In this same chapter Jehovah, “The Judge,” is mentioned as the “Father of spirits”. (Heb. 12: 9) “For they [fathers of our flesh] verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he [Jehovah, the Father of spirits] for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.” (Heb. 12:10) Thus the apostle shows to whom the words “spirits of just men” refer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’Concerning the rebellion of Korah it is written: “And they [Moses and Aaron] fell upon their facts, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the cone-rogation?” (Num. 16: 22) Those who have been begotten of the spirit have Jehovah for their spiritual Father, and this is true even while those creatures have an organism of flesh. The expression in the text “spirits of the righteous made perfect” therefore properly applies to the present-day remnant of spiritual Israel who now arc “spiritually minded”. (Rom. 8:G) Many who are begotten of the spirit do not prove faithful and are therefore not ‘perfected in the spirit’, whereas the remnant found faithful at the temple judgment and made members of the ‘elect servant’ class arc perfected. They were, righteous at the time, begotten of the holy spirit, and counted as God’s sons, and now as such righteous ones they are perfected. They have eomc faithfully through a discipline administered by their “Father of spirits”, Jehovah, that they might be made partakers of his holiness.—Heb. 12:6-10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The spirit-begotten ones arc the ones justified by the blood of Christ Jesus, and in addition thereto the, remnant are brought under the robe of righteousness. (Isa. 61:10) They are ‘arrayed in fine linen, which is the righteousness [righteous acts] of the saints’. (Rev. 19:8) The ones here described, therefore, are the ‘saints gathered unto the Lord’ and who have come to unity of the faith and knowledge, “unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” (Eph. 4:13,14; Ps. 50:5) It is therefore seen that the words of description appearing in this text, to wit, ‘the spirits of the righteous ones made perfect, or perfected,’ identify the remnant gathered to the temple unto the Lord. These are the ones toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated or dedicated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> This scripture having identified the remnant as the ones toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated, the very next words of the text mention the mediator, to wit: “And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.” (Heb. 12: 24) Jesus was made the mediator while on earth ISOO years previous to the inauguration of the covenant ; but now having come to the temple, and gathered unto himself the faithful, he inaugurates the covenant in heaven toward those who have been found faithful up to this point and who have been made to “sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus” with him. Because of his faithfulness in maintaining his integrity toward Jehovah Abel was murdered. Though entirely innocent when killed at the instance of Satan, the blood of Abel was merely the blood of an imperfect man. The blood of Jesus, the mediator of the covenant, as stated in the foregoing text, “speak-eth better things than that of Abel.” This blood of sprinkling, or the blood of the new covenant, is the blood of the Perfect One, the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah, and hence has redemptive value ami validates the covenant, giving security of its benefits </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> those who have been brought into the covenant. These are the things which the blood of Jesus “speak-clh”, imports or signifies, and which, to be sure, arc ‘‘better things than that of Abel”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> At the inauguration of the law covenant at Sinai there was a great convulsion and shaking of the earth. Later Jehovah said through his prophet: ‘‘For thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the brawns, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.” (Hag. 2: (&gt;) The apostle refers to this latter prophecy of Jlmigai and to the prophecy recorded by Moses, the shaking of Mount Sinai, when he wrote: ‘‘For ye are not come unto the mount Liat might be tombed, and that burmd with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkne-&gt;s, and tempest, and Lie sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard, entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: . . . See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refii'-ed him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake- not the earth only, but also heaven.” —Heb. 12:18,19,23,2b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> While other Scriptural texts show that at Armageddon there will be great physical disturbances, these words of the apostle Paul recorded in Hebrews concerning the inauguration of the new covenant do not appear to apply at all to literal shaking or violent movements to and fro of natural objects. What came to pass at Mount Sinai was typical, and foreshadowed-a shaking which is a searching judgment, process upon those who have covenanted to do God's will and which takes place at the time Christ Jesus sits in judgment as a refiner, and at which time there is a great shakeup amongst the creatures who have made a consecration to do God’s will. In this shaking some are cast away, while others are retained. Just such a shaking process began about 1918 and has progressed from and after that date, which marks the coming of the Lord to the temple and the beginning of judgment and the progress of his judgment. At the time of this shaking the lawless ones are gathered out and east away, which casting-away work is done, by- the Lord acting by and through his angels. “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shrill gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace df fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 13:41,42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The shaking that took place at Mount Sinai at the inauguration of the law covenant foreshadowed the shaking, the sifting and refining that take place at the time the new covenant is inaugurated by the Greater Moses. The apostle then continues to compare the responsibility of those in the new covenant with those in the law covenant. The Jews refused to hear and obey the words spoken by Moses, ami tiny did not escape thereafter, says the apostle: “Much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.” Now Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, speaks from heaven from the temple, and those in the covenant who do not obey him shall certainly not escape punishment.—Acts 3:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>,J</sup> The apostle in this connection quotes the prophecy of JIaggai (2:fi,7) and thereby definitely fixes the lime of the inauguration of the new covenant, to v.it, when the ‘Desired One’ comes to the temple for judgment. Then follows the shaking amongst tho-e who v.ere once in line for the kingdom. This latter shaking is for the express purpose of removing e\&lt;-ry one in line for the kingdom who is not proved faithful. Concerning this the apostle says: “And this woid, Yet once mote, signiiieth the removing of tho.e things that are shaken, us of things that are made, that thorn things which cannot be shaken may remain.” (Heb. 12:27) Thus he declares that ‘those which cannot be shaken’ are the faithful ones whom God has perfected and whom he has taken out ami placed in i-mmni-dntl, and who continue as his witnesses, and who participate in the vindication of his name. Such are the om-s in line lor the kingdom, and it is to these that the kingdom interests are committed by the Lord.—Malt. 21:47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The kingdom cannot be shaken or moved, and those who ultimately inherit with Christ Jesus the kingdom cannot be shaken out. It is the kingdom that will vindicate Jehovah’s name; hence all who are of the kingdom must stand firm and steadfast, and concerning this the apostle says: “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved |a kingdom not to be shaken, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Huth.],</span><span class="font4"> let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” (Heb. 12:28) That kingdom lias now-come and the interests on earth thereof have beta committed to the ‘wise and faithful servant’ class. Hence the apostle, addressing those toward whom the new- covenant is now inaugurated, and to whom thoe kingdom interests are committed, says: “Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” Those who do thus have the King for their friend, and, having the King for their friend, they must have grace and gracious voids upon their lips, serving God with pureness of heart. “He that loveth with a pure heart, and hath grace on his lips, will have the king as his friend.” (1’iov. 22:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lccser)</span><span class="font4"> Such faithful ones serve God “with reverence and godly fear” for the reason that “our</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God is a consuming fire” (Ileb. 12:29) ; and it appears from other scriptures that at the time there are those in line for the kingdom but who refuse to hear and obey the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Priest, Prophet, and Mediator of the new covenant, and toward these God is a consuming fire. Jehovah, having separated his own and selected them as a people for his name, will sustain those who continue to faithfully maintain their integrity toward him; and hence they have occasion to fear God, but they have no occasion to fear what man or the Devil and his angels may do to them. They know that they have not the strength or sufficiency of themselves, but that their strength and protection come from the Lord. “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.” (2 Cor. 3:5) By Jehovah’s grace, as his witnesses they can do all things for which they are anointed and commissioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO ARE MINISTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Not every one who is begotten of the holy spirit is a minister of the new covenant, but only those who are brought to the point of maturity in Christ, which constitutes them elders in fact, not by the election of men, but by the spirit of the Lord, Telling the Corinthians that only by the grace of God could ho (Paul) do the things which had been committed to him, the apostle says: “God who also hath made us able ministers [servants, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.]</span><span class="font4"> of the new [covenant] ; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killcth, but the spirit giveth life.” (2 Cor. 3: G) In the first verse of that epistle to the Corinthians Paul seems to limit the word “us”, as used therein and in this text, to himself and Timothy, who were then doing a ministering work unto their Corinthian brethren. There were difficulties amongst the company of the Corinthians because some had been followinghumanleaders, and hence disturbance followed. Not until these brethren in the church who sought to lead should become elders in fact, that is, come to unity in the spirit, could they become the able ministers of the new covenant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Such has ever been the condition in the church. Wherever those in the church follow human leaders and ignore the Word of the Lord trouble is certain to result. The time is now come when the sanctuary of the Lord has been cleansed, and those who are in fact in the sanctuary are at unity and hence are able ministers of the new covenant. Why, then, do disturbances continue to arise among the members who associate themselves together in these companies? Manifestly because in such companies there are those meeting together who are not in the temple and have not come unto the unity of the faith and knowledge in Christ Jesus and who therefore are not anointed to do the work of the Lord. Such continue to manifest the spirit of selfishness and lawlessness, insisting on doing things their own way and ignoring organization directions; and hence disturbances follow. Thojc who are in the temple and appreciating their great favor from the Lord see that the enemy is fighting desperately against the remnant and that all in the temple must stand shoulder to shoulder for the kingdom message and novel’ be terrified by opposition that arises and that is brought against them by the enemy. “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the [gospel] of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the [gospel]. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation, a token coming from God.”—Phil. 1: 27, 28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> At this stage of the church anyone meeting with a company of the Lord’s people who refuses to abide by organization instructions, and who insists on being lawless and following his own selfish way, furnishes the proof that he is not in the temple and therefore not an able minister of the new covenant. The proper course for the remnant under such circumstances is to avoid all controversies and continue to do faithfully what they are commissioned to do. It is better to suffer wrong in silence and to go straight forward in the work which the faithful arc commissioned to do than to try to justify oneself or to defend oneself. (1 Cor. 6:7) Every one in the temple will have confidence in every other member of the temple companj' and will be diligent to put aside all selfishness and do the work committed to them with gladness of heart. At the same time they will avoid those who attempt to cause divisions.—Horn. 1G: 17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> As it is written by the apostle: ‘We are made able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit, which quickencth.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font4"> Merely written letters on books or laws or rules written down cannot of themselves move one to a course resulting in the approval of God, which quickencth to life. It is the power of the holy spirit of God within one that can and does carry one along the way toward life. Let those of the temple now fully realize and appreciate the fact that they have been brought into the temple, anointed and instructed there, in order that they might serve as Jehovah’s witnesses and thus minister unto the things for which they have been chosen and anointed. Individuals are clear out of sight so far as the temple company is concerned. All there are one body, instructed by the great Teachers lor one and the same purpose and sent forth to participate in the work of the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REFLECTING HIS GLORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, having received the law and commandments from God, “the skin of his face shone.” To avoid the Jews’ seeing his shining countenance Moses pvt a veil on his face, and when Moses went before the Lord to speak with him he took the veil off. (Ex. 34:27-35) The outcome of the law covenant with its statutes resulted in condemning the nation of Israel because of their rebelliousness, hence ministered unto them death. With this in mind the apostle Paul wrote: ‘’But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ! For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the dory that exccliclh. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.”—2 Cur. 3:7-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The shining of Closes’ face was a reflection of the glory of Jehovah, and Closes served as a mirror to reflect that glory. The administration of the new covenant by Christ Jesus the Mediator, who is the Greater Moses, is far more glorious than that which was manifested at the inauguration of the law covenant. The glory of the Eord Jehovah shines into the face of Christ Jesus, his great High Priest and Mediator, and is mirrored there to those in the covenant and in the temple. (2 Cor. 4:4-6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ll'dh.)</span><span class="font4"> At the inauguration of the law covenant the glory of God shone upon the face of Moses; hence the glory was not that of the Israelites, but .Moses was rejecting the glory of God. At the inauguration of the new covenant at .Mount Zion Jehovah there appears in his glory. Christ </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jcsib </span><span class="font4">mirrors the glory of Jehovah to those of Zion. (Ps. 102: 16) Had the law covenant produced ‘the people for Jehovah’s name’, such a people would have continued to be used to reilect the glory of Jehovah which shone in the face of the mediator, Moses. That covenant, having failed, was cast away, and now the new covenant does produce the “people for his name”, “a holy nation,” which people are used to reflect the glory of the Lord ; and that glory which shines in the face of the Lord Jesus is greater than that which was made to shine in the face of Moses. “For if that which passeth away [the law covenant| was with glory, much more th.it which remaineth is in glory.”— 2 Cor. 3:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ll.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> At the time Paul wrote the epistle to the Corinthians the glory there mentioned was still in the future, and this is shown by the words of the apostle, when he says: “Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech.” (2 Cor. 3:12) That glory was not seen in Paul’s day, but is seen at the inauguration of the new covenant. Had lie seen it he would not have talked about hoping for it. “Fer what a man secth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patiencewait for it.” (Pom. .8:24,25) During the period of waiting for the appearing of such glory the holy spirit was the advocate, comforter and helper' of the consecrated, which Paul knew. Having such hope, the apostle says, “we use great boldness of speech.” (R.F.) Having hope, he was not ashamed, because “hope maketh not ashamed”. (Rom. 5:5) If Paul used plainness or boldness of speech then, how much more now should the anointed of the Lord speak with boldness in this day of judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The apostle did not speak in veiled language; hence he employed this illustration, to wit: “And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.” (2 Cor. 3:13) The awestriking glory which Jehovah caused to appear upon the face of Moses frightened the Jews, because they win- looking at Mow's and not by faith at the Lmd God. To obscure the shining in the face of Moses input on a veil. The Jews gloried in a man, one of their own blood relation; hence they did not see that the glory of Moses as a mediator and inauguralor of the law covenant was temporary, which ‘ lory ended when the covenant ended. The purpose of the gloiy upon the face of Moses was to foretell in a miniature way the coming glory of the greater mediator, Christ Jesus, and the inaugiirator of the better covenant: but the Jews did not look in that direction, or to that “end”, and hence they rejected Christ Jesus wh&lt;n he came, and do still reject him. Therefore says the apostle concerning the Jews: “But their minds weie blinded [hardened, /».!'.] ; for until this day remaimth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. ” (2 Cor. 3:14) That blindness was upon the greater part of natural Israel and rendered it impossible for the Israelites to discern the meaning of the testimony of Moses and of the prophecies which follow.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“ The veil over the shining face of Moses corre-spondinglv shows that Christ Jesus, Jehovah's great Priest, veils the truth from the eyes of those that oppose God's Wind at the present time. When Isaiah had a vision of the temple the Lord said to him: “Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eves; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.” (Isa. 6:!), 1(1) This scripture shows a blindness of those who hear with their natural ears and see with their natural eyes-but do not perceive or understand. With the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple the significance of the typical picture was unveiled by the power of the holy spirit to those in Christ, and who are faithfully serving Jehovah, but the holy spirit does not reveal the meaning thereof to those who are unfaithful. Therefore says the apostle: “But even unto this d-y, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.” (2 Cor. 3: 15) This is actually true today with -in-Iudiag the “man of sin” company, who are not tn the secret place of the Most High, and to such the Greater Moses docs not reveal the secret things of God’s Word. The trouble with such opposers is that, even though they once had the truth, they have not the love of the truth, but, being selfish, they are blinded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> When Moses went before the Lord to speak to him “he took the vail off”. (Ex. 34:34,35) The apostle Paul, quoting from the above prophecy, says: “Nevertheless, when it [lie, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kolh.]</span><span class="font4"> shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.” (2 Cor. 3</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">: 16</span><span class="font4">) The apostle’s statement here proves that when there is a turning away from a man and a turning to Jehovah God, and fully trusting him and the Lord Jesus, the “vail” is taken away from the eyes of such as have the spirit of the Lord, and these have an understanding. The one turning to the Lord, therefore, is given a vision of his reflected glory, which glory is reflected in the face of Christ Jesus and shines into the heart and mind of those fully devoted to the Lord. Christ Jesus is “the brightness of his glory”. But where those who have covenanted to do the will of God continue to look to a man and his supposed glorious attainments and dote upon his teachings, they are blind to the truth; and this is clearly shown by the foregoing statement of the apostle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Today those who continue to insist that Pastor Russell taught all the truth that is to be learned by the saints on earth are in the dark, and they will continue in the dark. They fail to discern the Lord at his temple, and scoff at the statement that he is at the temple. Their continued blindness to the understanding of the prophecies of the Bible is proof thereof. When the natural Jews today read that which was written by Moses, the matter is entirely dark to them. Likewise with those who are once spiritual Israelites, and who have continued to look at a man and not to the Lord, the understanding of the Scriptures is impossible to them. Those who turn to the Lord and trust in him, for them the veil is removed and they see what the Lord reveals to those in the temple.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBERTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Jehovah is the supreme power, that is, the Most High. The Lord Jesus Christ is the higher power next to Jehovah and is the “quickening spirit”. (1 Cor. 15:45) Moses was a type of Christ Jesus and was flesh, or human, foreshadowing the spirit creature, Christ Jesus. Continuing his argument the apostle says: “Now the Lord [Jehovah] is that spirit [The Spirit, Zf.l'.]: and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” (2 Cor. 3:17) Some spirit-begotten ones have foolishly seized upon this scripture text and hold to it as an authority or excuse for their lawlessness in God’s organization, contending that where the spirit of the Lord is each one is at liberty to do as he may please and is under no obligation to follow the rules of God’s organization, and hence they do not follow the direction in God’s organization. Such application of the text is wholly wrong. One in Christ Jesus is not licensed to do anything he wants to, but must be obedient to the Lord and his organization. Liberty does not mean license. Where there is truly the spiritually minded condition existing among those who are begotten of the spirit these are free from the bondage such as the Jews were in. The spirit of the Lord is upon and among his anointed ones, who are in the temple or seciet place of the Most High, but that is not the condition of the “great multitude”, who are prisoners to Satan’s organization. It could not be said that they are free. Such condition of bondage refers to those in the ranks of the nominal church systems and outside of it who are spirit-begotten but who are held in bondage by the fear of man. There are many who claim to be in present truth who are in fact under bondage to fear of Satan’s organization. That condition does not, however, apply’ to those who are in the temple; says the apostle, “But Jerusalem [God’s organization] which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” (Gal. 4:26) Therefore those in the secret place of the Most High, anointed and in the temple, are not in bondage to any worldly power as though such worldly powers were the “higher powers”. But those who are looking upon the rulers of this world as the “higher powers” are certainly in bondage. The faithful, however, being Jehovah’s witnesses and appreciating the truth and that this is the. day of judgment, these have boldness in declaring the truth, and this is proof of their love for Jehovah and of their freedom or liberty in Christ. —1 John 4: 17, IS.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Such faithful ones refuse to recognize the rulers of this world as the “higher powers”. They refuse to compromise with the powers of Satan’s organization, and refuse to ask them for or to accept permits from Satan's organization to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom. They obey God, and not man, because they are free from bondage of man and man-made organizations ruled by Satan. It is therefore only where the spirit of the Lord is that there is such liberty; and such is the meaning of the apostle’s words in the foregoing text. All those in Christ and in the covenant, taken out as a people for the name of Jehovah, are, however, bound to be fully and wholly obedient to the great Prophet, Christ Jesus; and since the instruction to the remnant proceeds from the Lord at the temple, all of the temple company must be wholly obedient to the organization instructions proceeding from the Lord.—Acts 3: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Christ Jesus is the head of the house of sons, and those who are in his house, that is to say, in the royal house of God in the timple, are wholly free from Satan’s organization. The words of Jesus addressed to those who thought they were God’s servants are: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the-truth shall make you free. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (John S: 31, 32, 36) The same rule applies at the present time. One mint know the truth and must be in Christ Jesus and faithfully obey the Lord in'-order to be entirely free from Satan’s organization. But that has no reference whatsoever to liberty to exercise one’s own selfish desires or will and go contrary to God’s organization instructions. Those who insist on following their own selfish desires and ways and on ignoring the instructions that proceed from the temple put themselves outside of the pale of God’s favor. Let no one think, because he is in the truth, he is at liberty to do as he pleases. lie must do as it pleases the Lord, and the will of the Lord is expressed in his Word; and the Lord is dealing through his organization, and has one way of doing his work, and not many.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VISION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The apostle, then addressing his words specifically to those who have the spirit of the Lord, such as himself and such as are today in the temple and faithfully serving Jehovah, says: “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.” (2 Cor. 3:18) In the typical picture it was Moses’ face that was veiled, and not the face of the Israelites. In the antitype it is the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, whose face shines, and that shining is the reflecting of Jehovah’s glory. Therefore when the face of the spiritual Israelite is turned to the Lord, and hence away from man, the veil is taken away and the vision of the unveiled face is had by those who are with Christ in full unity. This explains why those at the temple have a clear vision of the Lord’s purpose and his glory at this time and others who think they are in Christ have no vision at all. Another rendering of this text is: “But we all beholding the glory of the Lord in a face unveiled, are transformed into the same likeness, from glory to glory, as from the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Cor. 3:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font4"> The Lord Jesus does not veil his glory from us (with all who are in the temple), because we have faith and have the spirit of the Lord. All such are spiritually minded and have a vision, while others arc blinded. The faithful in the temple look into the unveiled face of the Lord Jesus Christ as though looking into a mirror, and they see there the glory of Jehovah upon Christ Jesus, and such glory is caught up by those in the temple and reflected. The glory here mentioned is not any part of us, nor is that glory of us. The greater mediator and inaugurator of the new covenant is the one that is reflecting the glory of Jehovah, because he is now at the temple, ‘in his glory, and all his holy angels with him.’ (Matt. 25: 31) Jehovah gives his glory to Christ Jesus, and to his temple company, and to none other. (Isa. 42:8) Christ Jesus reflects the glory of Jehovah, and those in the temple, beholding this glory, reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus to others, that they may see who are the true witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Such faithful ones “are changed into the same image ”, ‘ ‘transformed into the same likeness. ’ ’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diag.) </span><span class="font4">The remnant brought into the temple at the inauguration of the new covenant arc ‘ ‘ caught up . . . in the elouds, to meet the Lord in the air”. (1 Thess. 4:17; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver,</span><span class="font4"> January 15, 1934) From out of the temple they discern the Lord’s glory and receive instruction from him, which they receive in the secret place and which instruction changes their entire course of deportment and action. They are cleansed of things which are not of the Lord, such as the fear of man, the worship of man, the submission to worldly powers contrary to God’s will, the conforming of themselves to man’s teachings, and the following after man, and from anything else or all things else that mark one as conforming to the formalism of Babylon. The temple company must be conformed or transformed to the image of Christ Jesus. “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called : and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.”—Hom. 8: 29, 30.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Those who are brought into the temple and toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated see and appreciate the truth that Christ Jesus is “the faithful and true witness” of Jehovah God, full of integrity toward God, and wholly devoted to the vindication of his name; and they appreciate now that they must be like the Lord in this respect. Therefore they must be faithful witnesses of Jehovah, because they have been with Jesus and learned of him and must do as he does, and they must be bold in bearing the testimony to the name, of Jehovah. Concerning this same matter it is written: “Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John . . . they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus,” and hence were bold and fearless witnesses to the name of Jehovah. (Acts 4:13) Thus their course of action is changed from what it was during the Elijah period of the church and they become like the Lord, as bold and fearless witnesses. This does not mean to be rude witnesses, but to calmly and fearlessly tell the trulli.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The foregoing scripture, which says, “from glory to glory,” does not mean that those of the remnant or temple company are changed from the glory of the law covenant to the glory of the new covenant, but that they are changed into the likeness of Christ Jesus as faithful witnesses to the name of Jehovah. During the Elijah period of the church the faithful ones in a measure reflected the glory of the Lord, but, being transferred from the Elijah to the Elisha period of the Lord’s work, they have greater honor and glory of service, because the Elisha work is an unselfish devotion to the honor of Jehovah’s name. It is in this day that it becomes more apparent to the Jonadab class as to who are the true witnesses of Jehovah giving honor to his name even as Jesus did when he was on earth. Concerning his faithful followers Jesus said: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have t’ivcn them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” (John 17:22) The faithful ones reflect the glory of the Lord that even those outside may determine who are really unselfishly devoted to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup>' Such transformation conforms one to the likeness of Christ Jesus, &quot;even as of the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Cor. 3:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inaryin)</span><span class="font4"> Christ Jesus has appeared at the temple and gathered Jehovah’s saints unto himself, and now apply the words of the apostle: ‘‘When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.” (Col. 3:4) Here Christ Jesus instructs the temple company, and sends them forth to ri-iieet his glory. (Matt. 10:27) The angels of the Lord have gathered out the lawless ones, and the Lord has clothed the faithful ones with the robe of rightoou«m-&gt;s, and sends them forth as his witnesses to shine by rctleeling his -.dory; and now arc fulfilled his words: ‘‘Then rhull the righteous : hine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Fath' r. Who hath errs to hear, let him hear.” (Matt. 13:43) Only Jehovah's witnesses, made part of the elect servant da.is, are given sueh glory. (Isa. 42: 8; 43:7) As the faithful witne“:es of Jehovah them maintain their integrity toward him, and because they do so the reproaches which fell upon Christ Jesus fall upon them and they are opposed and persecuted. (P.om. 15:3) The facts show that such are exactly the present-day conditions and experiences of Jehovah's witness's who are boldly declaring the name of Jehovah. ‘‘If ye be repronehul for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.”—1 1’et. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> It is now the glorious privilege of the faithful to be witnesses to the n;ii:ic of .Jehovah, when his great Judge is at the temple judging the house of God and separating the people as sheep and goats are separated. The true followers of Christ Jesus are &quot;not ashamed to be Jehovah’s witnesses, but .rejoice that they may have a part in delivering the testimony to the vindication of his name. (1 Pet. 4:16) They declare the righteousness of God.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SATAN AND EGYPT AND ASSYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">C n 1I1E ruling factors of ancient Egvpt comprised g the king and princes, the religious professors, the militarists and the building' engineers. Of the long ago it is written, in the sacred Scriptuns: ‘‘The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">princes</span><span class="font4"> also of Pharaoh [the king] saw [Abit.-ham’s wife Sarah], and commended her belote Ph--rtioh.” (Gen. 12:15) This statement shows that the king had his politicians looking alter his personal interests. Concerning Abraham’s great-m'-iiidson Jn-vph, who was in Egypt later on and was held in prison, it is v.iitten: “The Icing sent and loosed him: even the rid'r of the people [of Egypt!, and let him co free. He mmle him lord of hi.; house, and ruler ci all his substance; to bind his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">princes</span><span class="font4"> at his pleasure, and teach his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">senators</span><span class="font4"> wisdom.”—Ps. 105: 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special provision was made in Egypt ter th&quot; nwn-g<sup>f</sup>rs of religion. Tina historic record gif .-s an in-tanci* ot this, saying: &quot;Only the land of the priests bomdit he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them oi Pharaoh, and did eat their portion vnirh PhaiaMi gave them; v.lmiei’ore they „old not their land-.’’ (Gen. 47: 22) In the Devil’s organization lie bad si-i n to it that the religionists were particularly taken enio of and provided for. The Devil has always kept religion prominent, end to the fore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the military forces it is written ti.-.t Pharaoh had a great host of chariots, and horses to draw those chariots, and horsemen. (Ex. 15:4; 14: 7,9) The Lord’s prophet (Jer. 46:4,8,9) says: “Harness the horses; and get up, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font4"> horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandi.nes. Egypt riseth up like a flood [of the Nile river], . . . Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.” The Ethiopians and Libyans and Lydians were the allies of Egypt, and their place of residence was on the border of Egypt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As proof that the Egyptians were great builders and engineers, it is written: “Therefore they did set over them taskmasters, to afilict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, I’ithom and Raamscs.” (Ex. 1:11) It is in the land of Egypt that great pyramids and temples have been builded, and without a doubt they were built at the instance of Satan. These combined ruling factors of Egypt were haughty, domineering, blood-guilty, oppressive, presumptuous and blasphemous.—Job 21:14,15; Isa. 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proof is conclusive that Egypt was Satan’s organization and that the dominating clement in the visible part of that organization was the commercial power, which created and operated the military for its selfish purposes and caused the politicians to do the bidding of that element. The religious element of the nation was that of the Devil, and wielded an uncanny influence over the other ruling factors. Here again the manifest purpose was to turn the people away from God and to corrupt them and keep them in subjection to the Devil, who was particularly represented in Egypt by Pharaoh the king. To further strengthen the proof, God in his Word definitely says that Egypt is the Dragon or Devil organization, created and organized by Satan, who claims the earth and everything therein for his own selfish purposes: “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh [the Devil] king of Egypt, the great </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dragon </span><span class="font4">that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, Sly river is mine own, and I have made it for myself’’ [let Jehovah keep his hands off].—Ezek. 29: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The common people of Egypt were kept in subjection to the rulers, even as Satan keeps the peoples of earth in subjection to himself by and through the rulers. The common people were not so harsh to the Israelites in bondage as were the rulers. It is even so today; the common people are not harsh against God’s people, as are the ruling factors. The financial lords today claim the natural resources of the earth which God meant for the people. They also advance the opinion that they properly rule and control the people, and that by divine right. Egypt was a house of bondage to God’s people, Israel; and so the Devil’s ganization is holding the peoples of earth in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assyria, the next ancient world power, was also an organization of the Devil. Three elements or governing factors, to wit, religious, commercial and political, appeared therein, but that which is made the foremost is a political religion, or a political rule, or a form of religion that is used by the politicians. By that is meant that the politicians who controlled the people accepted the religion as a matter of expediency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophetic books of Jonah and Nahum are devoted exclusively to Assyria and Nineveh, its capital city, and strikingly foretell a state of the Devil’s organization in which a political class will be in the saddle and adopt and follow a false religion because it is thought expedient in carrying out the political purposes. In this the political factor is strongly and consistently supported by the commercial power, the “giants’’, which together with the politicians are made the principal ones of the tlock of the religious system. The prophetic record concerning the Assyrian world power seems to clearly foretell a condition of the Devil’s organization existing during the period of preparation for and immediately before the great conflict between Satan’s organization and God’s organization. Otherwise stated, it foretold a condition existing on earth when approaching the lime of the establishment of God’s kingdom, which time is the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nimrod, the notorious “mighty hunter’’ of old, was Satan’s chief man on earth, lie had built Babylon and three other cities in the land of Shi mar, and became a great campaigner against the peacefully-disposed Shemites who lived in Mesopotamia. Asshur was one of the sons of Shem, and evidently he and his offspring settled that part of the valley of Mesopotamia that lies north of Babylon. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria and, according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Common</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> of the Bible, it was built by Asshur. (See Genesis 10:11.) The accuracy of that translation is disputed by many who claim that it was Nimrod who built Nineveh, the capital city. There is much force to their contention. Genesis, chapter ten, verse ten, tells of the beginning of Nimrod’s exploits. Fiom verses six to twenty the record pertains to the sons of Ham, of which Nimrod was the most prominent. It docs not seem reasonable that in the very midst of the description of that family it would break off the continuity of the description by interjecting the statement concerning the sons of Shem, who are mentioned in the same chapter, beginning with the twenty-second verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One well-recognized authority on translation (Hislop) contends with much force that the proper translation should read thus: “And he [Nimrod], being strengthened [after be had built Babylon, and Ereeh, and Aecad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar; and had become a ‘mighty’ man in the earth] went forth out of that land [Shinar], and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah.” The marginal rendering of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Common</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> supports that conclusion, and it reads: “And he [Nimrod] went cut, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">into</span><span class="font4"> Assyria.” The weight of authority, therefore, is that Nimrod extended his domain and increased his might in the earth by invading Assyria and bringing Assyria into subjection to him, and that he built Nineveh as its capital city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the prophets of the Lord calls the land of Assyria the land of Nimrod. (Mie. 5:6) Being the capital city, Nineveh was the official residence of the ruler who is called ‘‘the king of Nineveh”. (Jonah 3:6) It was the royal city of the second world power, and Babylon became the capital city of the third world power. Thee diets show that Assyria, and its chief city, Nineveh, was an organization of Satan 1 he Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nineveh was a city or organization of great importance, and is called ‘‘Nineveh, that great city”; and, again, the prophet says, “Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.” (Jonah 1:2; 3:3) The Hebrew day’s journey being approximately twenty miles would therefore malic the city approximat“ly sixty miles in circumference. The prophet says that there were more than sixscore thousand persons (120,(,'00) that could not di.vern between the rigiit hand and the left hand. This manifestly refers to infants, and would warrant the conclusion that the total population of the city was between six hundred thousand and a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lion is u.-&gt;ed in the Script ores to symbolize a ruler. (Gen. -'.9:9,10) Fierce lions would therefore symbolize harsh, cruel, and oppressive rulers. Such rulers or political instruments operate selfishly at the behest of the mighty commercial power, and their evil deeds arc screened by the hypocritical religionists. Describing the capital city of Nineveh and its rulers, the prophet says: ‘‘Where is the den of the lions, and the fecding-plaeo, of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caws with prey, and his dens with ravin.” —Nah. 2:11,12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lt.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In prophetic phrase is lu re described a company of cruel political rulers, who exploited the people to feed themselves and their allies in the Devil’s organization. Manifestly this record of the prophet is made that the predominating element of that part of Satan’s organization could be disposed. God then expressly declared that he is against that organization. This is the best proof that the organization mentioned there is that of Satan the Devil.—Nah. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The king boasted of his political power and that he had a tremendous political organization: ‘‘For he saith, Are not my princes altogether [all of them] kings [politicians]'?” (Isa. 10:8) Nineveh was permeated with and debauched by the Devil religion. Here is proof that the symbolic “whore” mentioned in the Scriptures is the Devil’s organization, and particularly the religious part thereof, which the Devil uses to seduce and turn the people away from Jehovah and to cause both rulers and people to walk on in darkness and evil: “Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavourcd harlot [Nineveh], the mistress of witchcrafts, that sellcth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.”—Nah. 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Devil, by appealing to the superstitions of the political and commercial giants and rulers of the land, seduces them and causes the nation to be under his (Satan’s) control. At the present day there is much evidence showing that both politicians and big financiers consult spirit mediums and thus receive information from the Devil. While the politicians in Nineveh were in the van of (lie organization, the commercial factor was exercising its part. The organization of Assyria, and particularly the capital city, Nineveh, was noted for its commercial wealth; as the prophet says: “Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.” (Nah. 2: 9) “Thou [Nineveh] hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars ot heaven: the cankerworm spoiieih, and ilu’h away.” (?&lt;ah. 3:16) As an example, consider Ike present commercial-military powers of the world and see how well the prophet long' ago described them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assyria, and its capital city, was a great military power and was strongly fortified. Says the prophet, (Nah. 3:17;: “Thy crowmd [rulers or officers of authority] are as the locusts and thy captains [field marshals or military commanders] as the great gras-hoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day [the latter sitting around ready to act at the bidding of their owners].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Assyrian army which encamped before Jerusalem approximated two hundred thousand warriors. There were probably many more than that, but the record is that one hundred and eighty-five thousand of them were killed by the Lord Jehovah God in one night. The king of Assyria defied Jehovah God, and endeavored to turn even God’s consecrated people away from him anil cause them to give allegiance to the Devil. (Isa. 36:13-20) And thus is proved Assyria’s military strength and her being used by the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assyria, and particularly Nineveh, her capital city, Satan's organization, and which was ruled by the politicians, profiteers, militarists and religionists, was a bloody organization proving upon others, lying to deceive, exploiting and robbing the people. “Woe to the bloody city!” cries out the prophet (Nah. 3:1, 2 '•, “it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departmh not; the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattle g of tire wheels, and of the prancing hor-es, and &lt;&nbsp;f the jumping chariots.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the rulers of Nineveh who brought about the Samr.rikins, that company of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">rfliijioj.s</span><span class="font4"> hybrids who were colonized in Palestine, and who mingled their paganism, the Devil religion, with a pretended an I superstitious worship of Jehovah. The Lord pmud.v names the Samaritans as “adversaries'’ of hn people, who wanted to join with those who were God’s people and to call themselves by the name of the Lord and at the same time practiced the Devil’s religion in the name of Jehovah. As it is written (Ezra 4:1-3): “Then [the Samaritans] came to Zernbbabcl [the Jewish governor], and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build [the temple to Jehovah God] with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him, since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur [Assyria], which brought us up hither.” “When God’s chosen people refused to join with them, these same hypocritical religionists became the avowed enemies of the Israelites and persecuted them. (Ezra 4:4-7) The Assyrian rulers had carried these aliens into Samaria to repoptilate that land, and 1o establish there the Devil religion in order to corrupt their neighbors the Jews.—2 Ki. 17: 21-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three great earthly organizations, namely, Babylon, Egypt, and Assyria, were all Satan’s organizations which show his wicked organization from different viewpoints. Babylon is the mother, and Jehovah God in his Word represents her as “the great whore” and “the mother of harlots”. (Rev. 17:1-5) The Devil’s organization is that which gives birth to all the other organizations that have opposed and still oppose Jehovah God and bring reproach upon his name and persecute his anointed ones. It is the Devil religion that has corrupted the political rulers and the commercial giants of the world and turned them against Jehovah. God’s Word indicates that when the time comes the political and financial powers will awake and, learning a measure of the truth, will hate the old “whore” and make her and everything that is visible of that wicked organization desolate.—Rev. 17:1-17; Isa. 10:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assyria therefore more particularly represents the Devil’s organization at a time when political rulers dominate the nations and work together with and under the direction of their commercial allies and &gt;&nbsp;up-port and uphold a fal-&gt;e religion, and shows that they will so continue until the crash comes. Egypt, being the Devil’s organization, particularly magnifle-, the commercial part, which produces and maintains the military power, as predominating, while at 1 he same time the politicians and the religionists work together to carry out its policies. Babylon stands as the “mother” of the whole wicked system, and specifically and primarily represents the Devil’s organization; and all who become a part of her pioperly take her name and arc designated as Babylon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE REAL SACRIFICIAL LAMB</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font4">T THE time that the Jews or nation of Israel were brought forth out of the house of their bondage in the land of Egypt, a male lamb and its shed blood featured in the proceedings. All that was a prophetic picture, indicative of good things to come.—Ileb. 10:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God’s beloved Son Jesus was the reality foreshadowed by the passover lamb of Israel. In the picture the blood of the lamb was important because of what it represented. The blood of the beloved Son of Go'l, sacrificially poured out, is of very great importance to all men. Clergymen who ignore or minimize the importance of the blood of Jesus as the great ransom price for man do violence to the Word of God and aid Satan tc turn the people from the only name and way that lead to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s law required the Israelites to make preparation for the passover. (Ex. 12:1-28) The head of each household pictured Jehovah himself. Four days before the sacrificing took place the land) must be selected. Four literal days before the death of Jesus he offered himself to the nation of Israel. Jesus died about 4,IGO years after the sin and fall of Adam, lienee four days of one thousand years each prior to Jesus’ death Jehovah selected Jesus to be the Redeemer of man. Therefore the four days in the picture were both literally and symbolically fulfilled in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The passover lamb must be a male and without blemish. The One whom the lamb foreshadowed must be a male without blemish. Why must this victim for sacrifice be a perfect man'/ Because the perfect man, Adam, had violated God’s law in the garden of Eden, and for that reason his life was taken away. The law of God required a life for a life; therefore the One who must be substituted in death for Adam must be a perfect man. This is the reason why the animal used to represent the Redeemer must he without blemish. The redeemer of Adam and his offspring, therefore, must be a perfect man, nothing more and nothing less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all the earth there was no perfect man. All were condemned because of the imperfection resulting from the sin of Adam. Thore was none good. (Ps. 14:3) No man was qualified to ransom his ft 1-low man. (Ps. 49:7) These scriptures show man’s extremity. God had made the eaith for man to live upon. (Isa. 45:12,18) Dian’s desire was and ever has been to have life everlasting. God had promised to bless all the families of the earth, which blessing means an opportunity for life. God had promised to redeim man from death. What, then, could be done ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah sent his beloved Son, the Logos, to earth. Was it necessary for the Logos to die in order to become a man? No. If is right to life and his existence were transferred from the spirit plane to the human nature. Jesus was begotten as a babe in the womb of Diary, and this was accomplished by God’s exercising his holy spirit or invisible power; and in due time Jesus was born. Jehovah by direct operation of his power gave the babe Jesus life and the right to life, and for that reason he was born a perfect babe. The fact that Jesus was born of an imperfect woman docs not mean that he was in the slightest imperfect. The right to existence and existence being given to him by Jehovah directly, and Jehovah being the only One from whom life emanates directly, it follows that this babe Jesus must be perfect in every respect. Jehovah could not make an imperfect thing, because “his work is perfect’’.—Dent. 32: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures identify the Logos and the beloved only-begotten Son of God as the beginning of creation; and then it is written: “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us [men],” and he was “full of grace and truth”. (John 1:14) “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.” (Gal. 4:4) The fact that ho was born of an imperfect woman did not mean that he was imperfect, because his life proceeded from Jehovah, lie was born a human creature, that he might be the Savior of mankind. (Luke 2:11) Thus did Jehovah prepare Ono who possessed all the qualifications to fulfil that which the passover picture foreshadowed; to wit, One qualified to provide the price to redeem the human race.—Heb. 10: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subsequent authoritative testimony recorded in the Bible proves beyond a doubt that the passover lamb pictured the Son of God; and that Jesus, the beloved Son of God, was the reality. John the Baptist, as the forerunner of Jesus, announced his coming to those who would hear; as the Scriptures state: “The next day John secth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. Again the next daj- after John stood, and two of his disciples ; and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saitii, Behold the Lamb of God!”— John 1: 29, 30, 34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures further identify Jesus as one without blemish, foreordained by Jehovah to be the Redeemer of mankind, and therefore foreshadowed by the passover lamb. The apostle Peter (1:1:18-20) writes: “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The animal in the picture was harmless and without blemish. The reality was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”. (Heb. 7:26) Thus the testimony conclusively shows that the lamb foreshadowed Christ Jesus the Son of God. Jesus began his ministry when he was thirty years of age. He being perfect, because his life was received from Jehovah direct, and therefore being qualified to redeem man, his testimony is that he came for that purpose. “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”—Hiatt. 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the law of God required the Jews to observe the passover by killing the lamb on the fourteenth day of Nisan, and since Jesus was born under the law and is the real Lamb foreshadowed, it therefore was necessary for Jesus to be slain on the fourteenth day of Nisan. The beginning of the Jewish day is at six p.m. At the proper and appointed time Jesus with his disciples sat down to cat the passover lamb, as the law required. On that occasion Jesus said to his disciples: “With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.” (Luke 22:15) That was the last time the picture was ever properly repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later, and on the same day, Jesus' was killed. lie completely fulfilled the picture of the passover lamb at that time. That which the passover lamb foreshadowed now' became a reality in the death of the beloved Son of God. Jehovah does everything exactly on time. Jehovah did not take away the life of his beloved Son, but he permitted others to do it, and he saw’ to it that it took place exactly at the time to fulfil that which was foreshadowed by the passover lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the passover lamb used in the picture w<sup>r</sup>as slaughtered it could not and did not utter a protest. Through his holy prophet (Isa. 53:7) God had described his beloved Son as a lamb, who without protest went to his death. “He was oppressed, and ho was afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the titles given to the beloved Son of God is “The Lamb”. By this he is further identified as the One foreshadowed by the passover lamb. Of him it is written: “The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Rev. 13: 8) He is also in the same connection identified as the Mighty One of the tribe of Judah, about whom God caused Jacob to prophesy. (Gen. 49:10) He is showm to be the One foreshadowed by David, and the mighty Executive Officer of Jehovah who received honor as the “Faithful” One of his Father’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is written: “Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I [John] beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain. . . . Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.” (Rev. 5:5,6,12) The apostle Paul, as the inspired witness of Jehovah, writing concerning Christ Jesus and bis sacrifice, identifies him as the One foreshadowed by the passover lamb, saying: “For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”—1 Cor. 5: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keep always in mind that life is what Adam lost and life is what man desires, and that the only way to life God has foreshadowed in the sacrifice of the passover lamb, which lamb represented his beloved Son. This explains why the Logos was made a man and called Jesus, lie “was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross’’. (Phil. 2:7,8) The disability of the human race could be taken away only by the value of a perfect human life sacrificed. The human family is likened unto sheep that have gone astray, because born in sin and shapen in iniquity. (1’s. 51:5) God provided his beloved Son, foreshadowed by the lamb, to take awry the gn at disability upon the human race by reason of sin.—Isa. 53:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When he was &lt;m earth Jesus spoke of the human race as she and himself ns the Shepherd, and plainly pointed out that through his sacrifice is God's way that leads to life. “Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, 1 am the door of the sheep. 1 am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall he saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The Ihief comelh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: f am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the shetp.’’—Jolin 10:7,9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Son of God was sent to earth to provide the redemptive price for mankind. lie was not compelled to come to earth and die, but he came to do his Father’s will; and for this reason his Father loved him. Jesus said: “As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and 1 lay down my life for the sheep. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from mo, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and 1 have power to take it again. This commandment have 1 received of my Father.’’—John 10:15,17, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were required to roast the lamb whole, without breaking a bone, and then to eat the flesh, together with unleavened bread. What was thus shown and foreshadowed in the picture, God, through his prophet (Ps. 34:20), also foretold. When Jesus was slain as the reality foreshadowed by the lamb, not a bone of his body was broken. “But when they eame to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.”—John 19:33,36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bread which the Jews were required to eat with the roast lamb must be without leaven. Leaven is impure and therefore a symbol of sin. The unleavened bread foreshadowed the purity of Jesus. The Imad also was a picture representing the humanity of Jesus, given for the life of the world. Giving testimony concerning himself Jesus said: “Your fathers did cat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which eame down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give fur the life of the world. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drink-eth my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.”—John 6:49-51, 54, 55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The life is in the blood. The blood of the iamb poured out showed its death. The blood of J&lt;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">mis </span><span class="font4">poured out showed the pouring out of his life as a man. Prophetically it was written of him: “He hi’h poured out his soul unto death.” (Isa. 53:12) This testimony shows that aside from Jesus’ work as vindicator of Jehovah’s name a very neces.ary point of the divine provision for the blessing of mankind was and is the sacrifice of God’s beloved Son; that he made a picture of this in advance by the sacrifice of the passover lamb, which, under the* law, must be repeated each year until the coming of Jesus; that he sent his beloved Son into the world to die and pio-vide the ransom price for mankind ; that the* shedding of the lamb’s blood foreshadowed the shedding of the blood of Christ Jesus, which was shed for us; and that God made this provision for the human race because of his love for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore it is written: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever belicveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” (John 3:16,17) In the face of this overwhelming Scriptural testimony, how can any sane man say that the blood of Jesus is of no value in providing the way to life for humanity Can anyone who honestly thinks lip is a preacher, and who pretends to preach the Bible, claim that the blood of Jesus was not essential to give life to the peoples of the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The term “redeem” literally means to loose with something; it means a purchase price provided which is of suflicient value to purchase the thing desired to be purchased. The precious lifeblood of Jesus poured out in death on the tree on Calvary provided the prir-e for the redemption of the human race. 11 is perfect life exactly corresponded with the perfect life that Adam.enjoyed when in Eden, and therefore sati-lied the requirements of the divine law. It provided the price for the buying of life for the human race. “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. ” (1 Cor. 6:20) This corresponds with the further testimony, which reads: “Ye were . . . redeennd . . . with the precivus blood of Christ.”—1 INt. 1:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Asain, it is written of Jesus: “For thou wast slain, and hast n d&gt;'&lt;:ined us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.” (Rev. 5: 9) By the grace of God he tasted death for every man. (lleb. 2:9) It was the perfect man Jesus’ pouring out his lifeblood that provided the price for the redemption of mankind, which, after all, mankind must in God’s due time have an opportunity to know. “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?” (Rom. 10:14) So writes the apostle Paul.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Beverages—Potations — Drinkables</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE original food provided for man, and perhaps all he needed to drink, was in the fruit, which is still his best food. At any rate, nothing was said about drink; and there are some who claim that if one eats plenty of fruit he will not need to drink at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, one drink at a bubbling spring was probably enough to convince Adam that water is a good drink; in nature the lower animals drink nothing else, except milk. God provided Hagar with water to drink, and miraculously sustained 2,000,000 people in a rainless land for forty years, causing streams of life-giving waters to break out wherever they were needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures fail to record that any “health authorities” chlorinated the waters as they issued from the rocks at Sinai. That, at least, permits us to inquire if these people who insist on putting so many carloads of hydrochloric acid and other chemicals into public drinking water are absolutely sure that they are doing the wise and necessary thing. Chlorine causes fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chlorination of water is a great industry. It is now done automatically. A clever device automatically increases or reduces the chlorine according to the amount of pollution in the stream. There is no contention that the surface waters which drain barnyards and swamps are drinkable; but it is oxygen that such waters need, not chlorine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first chlorination of a public water supply was at Lincoln, England. It is claimed that in this instance a typhoid death rate of 17 per 100,000 was reduced to 1 per 100,000 by this means, and that chlorination of water “keeps it sweet and pleasant to taste and smell”. Maybe so, but—?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York city has an unusually good water supply; one of the best anywhere, we think. The water comes from the Catskill mountains, more than 100 miles away, and is brought under the Hudson river and down along the eastern hills in one of the finest aqueducts ever constructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New Hampshire is one of the most beautiful and healthful sections of the United States. The city of Dover, in that state, has an excellent water supply, yet a young woman secured a verdict giving her damages because, after she was made ill from drinking from a certain faucet, a worm was ejected from the pipe. And somehow we all feel as if she was entitled to something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Billions of Little “Critters”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Magnifying a drop of water a million times is said to show that every bit of water we drink is inhabited by cannibal microbes that make war upon one another constantly. At the New York Museum of Natural History is a glass device, which took four years to make, which shows, on a tremendously enlarged scale, what some of these little sinners look like. Some are minute plants which, nevertheless, are meat-eaters and set net-like traps for wandering microbes that are so small they cannot be seen by us when we pour them by the billions down our necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While those who ought to know tell us that many of these little savages are good for us, yet somehow we would just as soon take ours clear, more especially as we are also told that, when treated with ozone, water can be delivered crystal clear free from bacteria and with a very low organic content. Electricity converts oxygen into ozone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The method by which drinking water is electrically purified is well understood, and quite widely used. Sometime, when the bankers are all through with piling up service charges for the electric companies to load over on the rest of mankind, and their honest successors are interested in seeing what they can do to make the world a better place in which to live, all public drinking water will be ozonized, and safe for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oddly enough, one of the safest drinking waters is that supplied on shipboard. It comes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">from the briny deep. It is boiled; the steam rises through pipes to the distiller, which consists of coils with cold water running over them. This condenses the steam; result, fresh pure water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first public filter was constructed for the Chelsea Water Company, London, in 1829. This filter is still in use; no doubt it is so constructed that it can be frequently cleaned. A dirty filter is worse than no protection. Humans owe it to the lower animals to see that they have good, pure water to drink. The old oaken bucket was better before it became moss-covered. Too much water (most people do not drink enough) is supposed to carry off too many of the salts of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Early Drinks of Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cain and Abel drank milk to their mother’s delight, and most little folks from that time to this have followed their example. Somebody made the discovery that cows’ milk, goats’ milk, ewes’ milk, asses’ milk and mares’ milk are good to drink. Abraham served milk, probably cows’ milk, to his guests at the plains of Mamre. His descendants were promised that they should come into a land “flowing with milk”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The statement is made that for families spending as much as 20 cents per person per day for food, milk at 10 cents a quart is considered a good investment. Some dietitians preach and practice the milk diet most enthusiastically, while others claim that milk should not be much used by adults. Jesus did not mention it; Paul says it is food for babes, later put away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buttermilk is, by some, considered an excellent summer drink, but is detested by others. A gentleman who could never bear it had a daughter that sipped it from a spoon with keenest relish when she was but a few days old. Some children that sicken on sweet milk thrive on buttermilk. It is supposed to act as a cleansing agent, for those who can drink it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wine from the Days of Noah</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wine has been with us from the days of Noah (and quite probably from the days of Adam), and will be with us forever, and it was not and is not unfermented grape juice that is referred to. The Scriptures grant its reasonable use, but decry its abuse. The perfect man will have perfect judgment in this and in every other respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jacob, blessing Judah, foretold “Darker—his eyes than wine” (Genesis 49:12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham); </span><span class="font8">God himself prophesied, “I will bring again the captivity of my people . . . and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof.” (Amos 9:14) Wine was poured out as a drink offering to Jehovah God. (Exodus 29:40) It “maketh glad the heart of man” (Psalm 104:15); and it is even said that it “cheereth [both] God and man”. (Judges 9:13) In each of these instances it is fermented grape juice that is referred to; in most instances, it was but slightly alcoholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the New Testament we have the well known facts that Jesus’ first miracle was the turning of water into wine, that He was called a winebibber, that He used wine at His last meal on earth and asked to be remembered with wine; we have Paul’s advice to Timothy to use wine instead of water with his meals, and his advice to the aged women not to be given to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">much</span><span class="font8"> wine, showing that it was all right for the old ladies to take a little nip now and then, if they did not overdo it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are numerous cautions in the Scriptures respecting its use. The high priest might not drink it when he went into the presence of the Lord. Jehovah God mentions that in the wilderness He gave His people neither -wine nor strong drink. There is the statement that “wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; and whosoever reeleth thereby is not wise”. (Proverbs 20:1, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> Nazarites w’ere not to drink grape juice, fermented or unfermented, nor to eat fresh grapes or dried. (Numbers 6: 3,4, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) It</span><span class="font8"> is said of John the Baptist that he drank no wine nor strong drink. However, he admitted that he was unworthy to unloose Jesus’ shoe-latchet, and Jesus did drink, moderately. Of that there is not the least question.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Detached Viewpoint</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The detached viewpoint of those that are not interested in this subject one way or the other must be ours, and we are glad that it is so. It is like the profession of the winetaster. This man, so it is said, uses no stimulants of any kind, no matter how mild, uses no tobacco, and does not drink any of the vines that he tastes. He takes a little wine in his mouth, decides what it is, and then spits it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Formerly, wine was generally made by dancing barefoot on the grapes. It is the skins that give the color to the wine. Even to this day in France, the principal wine country of the world, the skins are not allowed to come to the top of the vat. Whenever they give signs of so settling, a man completely naked is let down into the vat to force them under again. Before the man can be let down in, the carbon dioxide and other gases have to be fanned away until the air is pure enough for the man to descend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hotter and drier the summer, the better the wine produced, because the natural sugar content is greater. That is why certain districts produce certain kinds of wines which cannot be produced as well in any other climate. If the weather in a certain season does not suit the wine growers of Burgundy, then no wine that is produced that year is sold as Burgundy wine. The various wines of which one hears, Champagne, Bordeaux, etc., come from certain carefully delimited districts bearing those names.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The French Take It Seriously</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The French take the wine business seriously, as the Germans do beer, and as the Scotch and Irish do whisky. There is the French Academy of Wine; its business is to popularize wine, and especially French wine, and to make it for other people what it is to Frenchmen, their “second blood”, so called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One job of the French Academy is to try to persuade the people of more northern climes to give up their hard drinks and come over to milder ones. French children are given wine with their meals from infancy, and are taught of it in school days. The workman will often drink a quart at a meal. France produces almost as much wine as the rest of the world put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wine consumption in France is tending to decrease, in spite of the efforts of the Academy to have it used instead of tea and coffee and the other alcoholic drinks. In Paris the number of arrests for drunkenness is more than double that of New York city, in proportion to population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Corks were first used in champagne bottles in 1682. Previous stoppers were made of hemp soaked in oil. Some wine was recently discovered sealed with a double seal, and known to be 800 years old; it had disintegrated and was unfit to drink. By the use of high voltage electric current wine is now ripened in one day, giving it the aroma of a product twenty years old. “Century-old” sherry can be produced in a few hours’ time. It is claimed that some wines, notably delicate sherries and port, are affected by ocean voyages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wine is the greatest Italian industry. In Italy wine has been sold for five cents a quart and fed to horses, mixed with their oats; mixed with water it is the family drink. Once a year, in the town of Marino, free wine is served for an hour in the vintage season. Great crowds gather for the celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most famous of wines is Tokay, 200 years old, priced at $15 to $100 or more a bottle. A man must reverently worship his stomach who can afford to buy it. At one feast, in the Middle Ages, in the home of Archbishop Neville, it is recorded, there were consumed 13,000 dozen bottles of wine and 75,000 gallons of ale; some must have loved their bellies then too, and had big ones at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the eyes of the law cider is wine, and Americans in recent years have been jailed and fined heavily for making and selling cider. Loganberry wine is made on a considerable scale in British Columbia. Rice wine has been made in Japan for 2,000 years. The American statesman Thomas Jefferson held that the widespread and general use of wine and beer was the only alternative of the whisky-drinking so general in his day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The recipe for unfermented grape juice is as follows: 10 pounds of ripe Concord grapes, 1 cup water, 2 pounds sugar. Add the water to the grapes and heat until stones and pulp separate. Strain. Then add sugar and heat to boiling point. Be sure sugar is well dissolved. Seal while hot. This recipe makes one gallon.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Beer Is Another Old Drink</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Beer is another old drink; it was made of barley in Egypt in the time of Moses. It was also made in Babylon. In the reign of Barneses HI of Egypt 466,303 jugs of beer were used for sacrificial purposes, libations to heathen deities. The brewers then (as they have been many times since) were priests. “Yuletide” originally meant “Aletide”, so it is claimed. At that time presents of malt were made to the priests with which to brew the beer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the days of Tacitus, writing in the first century of the Christian era, beer was a common drink in Germany, and it still is. It is defined as a liquor that has not undergone distillation. In 1914, it is claimed, enough beer was drunk in the United States to fill a ditch three feet wide and six feet deep running from New York to Seattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beer trucks have reappeared upon the streets, and booze joints formerly operated secretly now have open doors and signs to attract visitors. New York state is to have 7,000 drink emporiums, and was treated to the spectacle of three state senators demanding of the liquor board ten licenses each as their share of the graft. The pretzel business is booming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The effort of some to work up an appetite for the product of the brewer’s art was retarded slightly by the published discovery of 59 dead rats in one vat of a bootleg brewery, and the information coupled with it that the fishing of dead rats out of the vats is a part of brewery routine. The rats go wild over the smell of the malt, they fall into the vat, and sink to the bottom. After three days they swell and rise to the top, when they are skimmed out. The bitter, piquant taste enjoyed by some is traced to the vats that have not been skimmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beer racketeers are said to be still dumping their beer at $36 a barrel and telling proprietors who could buy better at less than half the price that they must take it and like it. Hesitancy or opposition means crepe and flowers, candles and holy water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Britain is now drinking more milk than beer. There is a wide demand there for a certain compound of malt and hops, which is sold with dried yeast in a separate container. Following instructions, the purchaser produces a nonalcoholic beer; but, if allowed to stand for a time, it gets as authoritative as may be desired, and produces correspondingly devastating results.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Brandy—Whisky—Gin—Rum</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Brandy, whisky, gin and rum are all practically one and the same thing. They are all distillates of spirituous liquors: brandy, of wine; whisky and gin, of grain; rum, of molasses. The percentage of alcohol by weight runs from around 40 percent to 55 percent. Nobody has ever claimed that it does anyone any good to drink any of this stuff; it is drunk for the effect it creates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are all kinds of combinations and modifications of the foregoing, and under a great variety of names. Grog is rum and water; toddy is rum, hot water and sugar; switchel is rum, water, molasses and vinegar; applejack is a name for apple brandy. The general effect of a small quantity of alcohol is to dull the finer faculties of the mind, while a large amount puts it out of commission altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cocktails are combinations of some or all of the spirits named in this subhead, along with lemon, orange, cherry, sardine, olive, sugar, and such other things as the bartender can guess at to make it interesting. Some or all of these are mixed with ice, and swallowed. It is an American habit and is filling Europe with dismay, where it is accused of being the direct cause of many motor accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prohibition caused the drinking in America of much denatured alcohol, anti-freeze liquids, Jamaica ginger, patent medicine, and anything else that had alcohol in it. In the state of Kentucky twelve deaths occurred, and in three states more than 5,000 persons were made desperately ill by Jamaica ginger drinks containing creosote and carbolic acid; the government got the guilty parties. Many were blinded by drinking wood alcohol abominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chile and Peru have a national beverage called chicha. Old women sit around a tub; they rapidly chew mouthfuls of maize and spit it into the tub. At length the tub is filled; water is added, and the mixture is left to ferment in the sun. Sounds as if it might be good—for those who like it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reaction time of a normal-individual automobile driver is one-fifth of a second. In that time he sees an emergency, weighs the possibilities, decides what to do, and applies the decision through his muscles to the brake, clutch, steering wheel or other mechanism. Reaction time is doubled by two ounces of whisky, which is considered an average drink. In other words, a drinker of hard liquor is handicapped by 14 feet 8 inches if he is going 50 miles an hour. This may cause his death, and has often caused the death of many others besides.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Caffeine Drinks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">How can a man whose nerves will not permit him to drink the mildest stimulant of any sort have a kind word to say for even the caffeine drinks, coffee, coca cola, tea ? And yet, without a doubt, almost every subscriber of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> drinks one or more of these delectable but nerve-wrecking beverages. We don’t like to offend anybody; but you may as well know the truth, and so we start you off with a quotation from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If coffee is mixed with milk or cream, it gives a certain amount of nutritive matter: but its action is usually due to the volatile oils, and to the caffeine contained. The volatile oil, like others in this class, stimulates peristalsis; but taken too often and in too large quantities the oil contributes to the causation of a certain amount of gastric indigestion. The more delicate the aroma of the coffee the less the oil, and the better from this standpoint. The action of caffeine is more complex. So far as coffee drinking is concerned, the action of caffeine is that of a cardiac stimulant, a nerve-muscle excitant, a diuretic and a cerebral excitant. Thus it may cause a sense of undue fullness in the blood vessels. It almost invariably causes a slight muscular tremor, which is noted in those who use their hands for fine work, as artists, for example. It causes an increased flow of urine, and tends to prevent sleep. Time, custom, usage, dose and the individual’s reaction all modify these general laws; but these reactions occur, although none of them may be of sufficient grade to make the observer cognizant of the action. Thus many people are not kept awake by coffee. They have probably habituated themselves and require larger doses. Hot coffee is one of the best heart tonics known, and it is sometimes administered in large quantities in cases of shock, opium poisoning, pneumonia, etc. Coffee is also valuable in many types of headache and in many cases of nausea. Its excessive use leads to great muscular irritability, gastritis, restlessness and sleeplessness. It is held by many medical men that the effects of coffee as a beverage are wholly bad. They say that the caffeine in the coffee, or in other vegetable substances—tea, coffee, kola, guarana and mate, or Paraguay tea—is a stimulant to the brain, nerves, heart and kidneys. In small doses it helps to resist fatigue, increases mental power and promotes excretion of urine. Large doses or continued use, however, tend to make a person nervous, to induce irritability of the heart, with considerable depression, and to upset the stomach. The mildest results of an overdose are a tendency to wakefulness, but there are recorded a number of deaths from heart failure due to its employment in large doses.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Gemaledie and the Whirling Dervishes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The use of coffee as a beverage had its origin with Gemaledie, the mufti of Aden, Arabia. He had learned of the drug in Abyssinia, across the strait from Aden, and asked the whirling dervishes to use it so that they might keep awake longer in their whirling in honor of the Devil and in dishonor of God. They took to it like a duck to water. This was about A.D. 1500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In A.D. 1511, having already discovered that coffee drinking is a mild form of intoxication, the Mohammedan General Conference at Cairo ordered its use discontinued, but they struck a snag. The sultan of Egypt in the meantime had become a coffee fiend; so they had to back up and reverse themselves and recommend coffee as a gift from Allah. Theologians are like that. Coffee is from the original Arabic name for it, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gahwah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world’s first coffeehouse was opened in Constantinople, in 1554; it had become popular in Venice by 1616; it is heard of in France in 1640, and at Oxford University, England, in 1649. In a little while there were 3,000 coffeehouses in London; they became gambling centers, and in 1675 Charles II ordered every British coffeehouse closed and imprisoned several of the proprietors. The places were subsequently reopened as clubs, and thus originated the famous London clubs, the centers of wit and literature of the eighteenth century. At first the coffee was served in bowls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year before the World War Germany drank 412,000,000 pounds of coffee; France, 220,000,000 pounds; and the United States, 990,000,000 pounds. The French are responsible for introducing coffee into the Western world. They introduced the plant into French Guiana and from there it was carried to Brazil, which now produces more than half the world’s crop. The Arabs carried it into Java and the East Indies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Coffee Is Still a Drug</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Coffee has no food value; it is a drug. Originally used by the whirling dervishes to keep them awake, it still keeps people awake, if that is what they want. High blood pressure and coffee drinking go together. A cup of coffee contains twice as much uric acid as the same amount of urine. The 2.5 grains of caffeine in the usual cup of coffee produces hardening of the arteries, damages the liver, kidneys and digestion, and causes nervous headaches. But you just go right ahead and drink it if you want to; all we are doing is telling you about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Coffee relieves light headache on the same principle that opium relieves pain. Rest and sleep are the true restoratives of man, not stimulants. When sufficient rest and sleep are not secured to insure recuperation, drugs only delay the day of settlement. Proper food gives strength; stimulants produce only weakness. The sleep produced by fatigue is sweet and restful ; that produced by opiates is of little value. Tobacco does not cure nervousness; it causes it. Coffee weakens the heart muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two or three cups of coffee three times a day produce muscular tremors, nervousness, anxiety, apprehension, palpitation of the heart, vertigo, heartburn, dyspepsia, constipation, insomnia, and emaciation. Victims of the habit, if deprived of it, suffer from languor, prostration, restlessness and craving. Swear off completely for one week, to find out if you are a coffee drug addict. After that, if you still want to drink it, go right ahead. Drinking coffee, it is said, makes one a deep thinker; maybe you want to be a deep thinker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Vienna reports a case of a man who had become a coffee drunkard. The child of an alcoholic drunkard, he inherited an abnormal thirst, which he tried to assuage with coffee. At forty years of age he was drinking 25 pints of coffee a day, with milk, and consuming 90 pounds of coffee beans annually. He applied to a medical clinic for assistance in breaking his inconvenient and expensive habit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>More About Caffeine Effects</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Health Culture</span><span class="font8"> is a good little magazine devoted to telling the truth about how to take care of one’s body. In an article on “Coffee—A Drug” K. M. Sterrett, M.D., has this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The first hour after the habitual morning cup of coffee seems to be filled with an unusual sense of mental power and physical well-being. But when the reaction sets in, according to a careful observer, ‘that representation of artificially exalted vital energy is gone, then there gradually creeps on a yawning drowsiness and greater inactivity than in the ordinary state, the movements of the body become more difficult than formerly, all excessive gaiety of the previous hour changes to obtuseness of the senses. If, in the first hours, an agreeable warmth pervaded the frame, this fictitious vital spark now gradually becomes extinguished, a shivering sensation is felt, the hands and feet become cold.’ There is no doubt that the continued and excessive use of coffee, in many individuals, leads to inflammation of the kidneys, on account of caffeine. This overstimulation of the kidneys can result in but one thing, sooner or later, unless the individual happens to have unusual powers of resistance—i.e., in Bright’s disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same writer shows that not only does caffeine at first whip the heart and kidneys into increased activity, but there follows an increased exhaustion and weakness, nervous confusion and incoherence of thought. The excessive use of coffee in Oriental countries is believed to be responsible for many cases of blindness. It is known to cause tinnitus aurim (whistling sensations) and transient deafness; also throbbing of the temples. Children that are taught to drink coffee “fly to pieces” without provocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A person who is accustomed to use strong coffee is likely to suffer from headache if he takes for breakfast a cup of coffee which is weaker than usual. The coffee drinker must have his full dose every morning, or he suffers. A coffee headache is an exhaustion headache, similar to that suffered from being long without sleep. Coffee, like strychnine, abolishes fatigue.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Tired All the Time?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Are you tired all the time, except when under the influence of coffee or some other caffeinecontaining drug, and do you have a headache unless you have your caffeine the first thing in the morning? Well, you are a caffeine addict, and the best thing you can do is to take no stimulant of any kind for at least a week, so you can study yourself and see how you are. Don’t think we are trying to get you to stop drinking coffee. Not at all. You keep right on drinking it till they come with the long box and the camp chairs. All we want to do is to tell you about it; and, besides that, we are not prophesying how long it will be before they drive up with the box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There have been numerous experiments in colleges and prisons to find out what the effects of coffee are. The New Haven </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal-Courier </span><span class="font8">had an article intended to show that coffee does not promote sleeplessness. Believing their point established, they wound up with the following, which proves exactly the reverse:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Who has not enjoyed a great book after a refreshing cup of coffee? And who has not, far, far into the night rejoiced that the beverage has given a tired mind the stimulation it has needed for concentration? Let us sing, therefore, the praises of the amber cup when quaffed at night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people who think they are buying ground coffee are truly getting some of that, but may also be getting peas, beans, wheat, rye, chicory, brown bread, pilot bread, charcoal, dried pellets or date stones. The average New York restaurant uses a coffee that is 15 percent chicory, and it is said that the men like it better than the real coffee they get at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Swedes are the world’s champion coffee drinkers; they average 600 cups apiece per year; Americans next, with 500 cups. The British drink tea instead; evil-minded Americans abroad have said that the reason why the British do not drink more coffee is that they do not know how to make it. This doubtful compliment to the good sense of the British loses its value when we come to the subject of their particular caffeine-drink—tea. Coffee drinking in the United States is on the increase.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Brazil the Coffee Center</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The so-called “coffee berry” is really the seed of the coffee fruit; there are usually two seeds in each pod, but sometimes only one. The growing and harvesting of coffee costs about 7c per pound. The green coffee is put up for shipment in sacks of 132 pounds, so that the cost of a sack is roughly around $10. Brazilian coffee is strong, highly flavored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brazil produces 69 percent of the coffee of the world, the crop for 1930-1931 being estimated at 25,000,000 sacks. In that year, in order to stabilize the market, the Brazilian government destroyed by fire or dumped into the sea about 12,000,000 sacks. Efforts to make illuminating gas from the low-grade coffee destroyed were not altogether satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whisky is now made from fermented coffeefruit pulp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The milder coffees of Colombia and Central America are much in demand for blending with the Brazilian coffees. Nine-tenths of the Colombian product goes to the United States for that purpose. The odd statement is made that the finest Costa Rican coffee is in such demand in America that it cannot be had in Costa Rica itself but has to be reimported from the United States, to be had free from adulteration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kora coffee, grown on Kora, Hawaii, is renowned for its fine flavor, being mild and mellow, and is used also in the United States for blending purposes. Colombia, Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, all together, produce about 4,000,000 bags a year, of which one-half is Colombian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is said that there is a coffee grown on Grand Comoro Island, off South Africa, which contains no caffeine. It is also said that in interior Venezuela there is a bean called Amazona which is very similar to coffee and is likewise without caffeine. We hope to see these caffeineless coffees take the place of all others in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meantime, let coffee-lovers who must avoid caffeine take heart. Kaffee Hag, not so very palatable, has much of the caffeine removed, and Sanka, very palatable, very delicious, has almost all of it removed. It is made, so it is claimed, from the finest Mocha and Java coffee, and, while it costs more at first than ordinary coffee, it costs less in broken nerves in the end.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>How to Make Good Coffee</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology spent three years and $40,000 finding out how to make good coffee. Wisely they recommend a coffeepot of glazed earthenware, china, glass or agateware. They did not recommend aluminum coffeepots; neither do we; we are not in cahoots with undertakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A man in the coffee business all his life tells us that the only safe way to make it is to have it ground fresh each time; put the ground coffee in a bag of ordinary Nainsook cloth and pour boiling water through it; it must never be allowed to boil; it should not be steeped; it should be served and drunk at once. Stale coffee loses its flavor and is not good for use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cafe au Lait, a popular French beverage, is made by mixing an equal amount of boiling-hot coffee and boiling-hot milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Brazil the coffee is served, so it is claimed, “black as night, bitter as gall, and hot as hell.” Rudyard Kipling wrote back from Brazil to England that he had to go to Brazil to taste coffee for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Joint Coffee Trade Committee of the United States recommends that coffee be drunk w’ithout cream, milk or sugar. (And, to be honest, it tastes like nectar that way to a man who does not dare to drink it.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Caffeine in Coca Cola</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Coca Cola syrup contains more than a grain of caffeine to the ounce. Believing that the country would be better off without this caffeine drink, the United States government is said to have sued, attempting to have its manufacture and sale declared illegal, but the suit was lost on a technicality, and it is being marketed at the rate of $40,000,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is claimed that the Coca Cola habit fastens upon its victims like a dope, and that those ensnared by it lose their efficiency and endurance and become senile prematurely. Pennsylvania has a state beverage law which prohibits the sale of cereal beverages to which caffeine has been added. If properly worded, such a law would exclude the sale of Coca Cola in that state, if we understand the matter correctly.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>How to Make Caffeine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The encyclopedia tells how to make caffeine. It says: “For commercial purposes it is commonly prepared from tea dust. This is heated for an hour with four times its weight of boiling water, and then mixed with its weight in lime, and dried. The caffeine is dissolved out with boiling chloroform.” In other words, the little old teapot on the back of the stove is making caffeine right along; and so we come naturally to the subject of tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have to handle this subject carefully, as we have so many British subscribers, and so we start out with a quotation from a good Britisher, Dr. W. E. Dixon, editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New Zealand Health Journal.</span><span class="font8"> That ought to be good; surely he won’t say anything to offend the teadrinkers :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One cup of tea usually contains more than a grain of caffeine, so that the average tea-drinker consumes five to eight grains of caffeine daily. The continual use of caffeine produces mental irritability, digestive troubles and physical depression. These effects can be produced by six to seven grains of caffeine daily. . . . Such persons are possessed of quick perception and acute sensibility, but are so responsive to external impressions that the common affairs of life tend to become a burden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ahem! Doctor Dixon is a bit savage after all; so we come back home and take a quotation from the little </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Health Culture</span><span class="font8"> magazine. Perhaps our British cousins will like this one better:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If a person consumed an average number of cups of strong tea (with milk) daily, he would partake, in one month, of enough liquid leather to make a pair of shoes. The tannin in tea hardens the lining of the stomach and bowels, inducing serious disorders. Tea hardens the food eaten, delays and diminishes the digestion of gummy substances. Tea, meat and eggs, are disastrous food combinations. The harder it is to give up tea drinking, the more its influence of narcotic action, shown by headaches and other depressing symptoms for the first few days of effort to abandon the tea habit. If tea be consumed immoderately, it leads to nervous agitation, muscular tremors, a sense of prostration, and palpitation of the heart. Tea checks digestion; therefore the error of the usual tea, bread and butter, scones, and cakes. Tea and coffee poisons owe their influence to their narcotic properties. Tea tasters suffer from head troubles, tremors, eye disorders, heart weakness and dyspepsia. Tea, especially strong Indian tea, is a cause of constipation. One pound of tea contains about two ounces of tannin, a powerful astringent, the same as the oak bark used by tanners to harden the skins of animals, in the process of manufacturing leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No, that is worse than the other. Well, here is a nice friendly quotation from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Argus Supplement,</span><span class="font8"> an Australian publication. It is an article recommending the use of tea, but it contains this, and those who think something of the one and only gullet they have may well consider it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Good tea can do nothing but good, provided it is not allowed to stand sufficiently long to permit of the extraction from it of the harmful tannin. That tannin is most deleterious is shown by the prevalence of cancer of the gullet in Australia, where the habit was to stew tea in a “billy” or kettle for hours, and to drink it all day long. The result of this was the tanning of the lining membrane of the gullet, whose leathery consistence opposed the free passage of food, and the consequent chronic irritation resulted in the frequency of cancer in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chin Nung and the Teapot</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chin Nung, Chinese poet, who lived 2400 B.C. [ ?], is credited with having brewed the first tea. If the date is correct, he was contemporaneous with Noah, and it is held by some that Noah at one time lived in China. The different qualities and colors of tea all come from the same shrub; it all depends upon the fineness of the leaf, and what is done with it afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The shrubs are picked thirty times in a season, and last for thirty years, when they must be replaced by new. The bud produces the finest tea, and the farther the pickers go away from it, the poorer the grade. Leaves picked in the early morning have better flavor than if picked later in the day. Tea grown at 5,000 feet above sea level is superior to that grown on lower levels. The word “tea” is a Chinese word. The Chinese scent their most expensive teas by exposure to the jasmine, rose, gardenia or sweet-scented olive. An average yield of tea is 400 pounds per acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tea was used in Arabia in 850, in Venice in 1559, in Holland in 1610, in England in 1615, and in America in 1650. The first tea house was opened in England in 1657; the price of tea at that time was $30 to $50 a pound. The tea was infused in bulk and kept in barrels to be drawn like beer, when it was warmed for use. In 1664 Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II, received a gift of tea from the East India Company; she liked it, introduced it into society, and it has been the fashionable English drink from that time to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the manufacture of green tea the older leaves, deficient in color, are treated with Prussian blue, indigo or soapstone. Prussian blue, though very poisonous, is useful in paints and dyes, and if a person wishes to dye his insides it is good for that purpose. Indigo and soapstone are doubtless as good as Prussian blue; it all depends on what use one wishes to make of his insides. We are not knocking green tea; we are just telling about it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Tea-Tippling Tunisians</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Before the World War there was no tea drunk in Tunis, but, as the Tunisians pitched in and helped the French in that conflict, it was thought they were entitled to everything the ‘Christians’ have, and so tea was brought in. It does not seem to be an unmixed blessing. A report in the Paris </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Addiction to the beverage is now widespread among the people. It has led to the institution of ‘tea parties’, at which the whole night is spent. In studying the pathological effects of such excessive teadrinking, Dr. Dinguizli noted harm done to the nervous system and to the blood, a general enfeeblement, eye troubles, and even a diminution in the birth-rate. Many natives, he reports, reach a condition where their craving for tea is so imperative that they sell their belongings and their tools in order to procure it and, in many instances, take to thieving. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is claimed that half the people of the globe are now tea-drinkers, and the habit is growing. Twenty years ago Britain consumed annually pounds of tea per head of population; the annual consumption is now between nine and ten pounds. Britain is the premier tea-drinking nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States ranks fifth among the nations in the per capita consumption of tea. The United Kingdom drinks six times as much tea as it drinks coffee, while the United States drinks sixteen times as much coffee as it drinks tea. Australia shows a great preference for tea; Canada a slight preference. Tea imports into France have doubled in the last two years.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Hoiv to Make Good Tea</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">To have good tea, use fresh water and bring it quickly to a boil. Stale water is tasteless. Pour the boiling water over the dry tea leaves and let it stand not more than 1| minutes. This absorbs all the delicate oils that give the tea its flavor, dissolves out enough tannic acid to give it a little tang, and takes out about four-fifths of the caffeine contained. Longer infusion gives more tannic acid, at the expense of the volatile oils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In central Asia, in and around Bokhara, everybody carries his own brand of tea around with him, and, after drinking his tea, eats the tea leaves, which are considered a tempting and irresistible delicacy. Sikh soldiers boil tea leaves, sugar and milk and water together until of the consistency of soup. In Thibetan monasteries tea is highly regarded because it promotes wakefulness. Tea buttered and thickened with oatmeal or barley serves the Mongolian tribesman for both meat and drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tea tasting, like wine tasting, is a recognized profession. In the United States seven men gather about a revolving table laden with cups, long-handled spoons and samples of tea. They determine the exact standards for the seven grades of tea imported into the United States. Once a year also the tea buyers embark for China and Japan on their regular buying trip, to get the choice of the spring pickings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Britain has one tea taster, Miss Margaret Irving, who every day samples 300 different teas. It is said that she can appraise the value of them within a fraction of a cent a pound. Dried tea leaves have such great absorptive powers that they quickly take up flavors of other foods, no matter what they are, when exposed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Chinese are such lovers of ginseng tea that last year they imported from the United States more than 250,000 pounds, for which they paid $8 per pound. Only the roots of the plant are used for this tea, which, as a drink, is not highly regarded in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides sassafras tea, which is a half drink and half medicine, the United States has a local tea, Cassina, which is much relished in and around Charleston, S. C. South America has a tea called mate, or Paraguay tea, of which 5,000,000 pounds are exported from Paraguay to other countries of South America. There is no demand, however, for this drink elsewhere. All of these teas have caffeine content, except the sassafras. Alfalfa tea is an excellent drink to which no objection of any kind can be raised.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Sodas and Other Soft Drinks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Joseph Priestley invented artificial aeration of water, in 1772, and sodas were soon on sale in Geneva and London. In 1807 a Philadelphia man added fruit juice as a flavor, and that w<sup>r</sup>as the beginning of the great soft-drink industry in America that now disposes of 11,000,000,000 bottles annually. It is calculated that into these bottles go 5,000,000 pounds of fruit acid, 1,000,000 gallons of flavoring extract, 250,000 tons of sugar, and 50,000 pounds of artificial coloring matter. How can one get his intestines of the right color unless he does something about it? we ask you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soda w’ater gushes in an unending stream out of the bosom of Mount Shasta, California, and the train stops long enough that all the passengers can have a free swig. Maybe there is a “service charge” by now, but there used not to be. At Altheide, Germany, soda water is so abundant that it is used for street sprinkling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Carbonated water forms copper salts when it comes in contact with copper piping, and such salts are frequently found in connection with soda fountains; they are of benefit only to doctors and undertakers. Saponin, used to make foam on certain soft drinks, when introduced into the blood has the power to destroy the red blood corpuscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fruit and Vegetable Juices</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What the human family needs to have to keep well are fruit and vegetable juices. It is claimed that a child has never been known to have infantile paralysis if the nursing mother drank fruit juices in place of milk. Orange juice is captured sunlight; so is lemon juice; so is grapefruit juice; so is tomato juice. If you want to get well and stay well, these are the things to drink. They can be taken separately or together, in hot water or cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You don’t have to stop there, for the Lord has filled the world with fruit, and in season and out there are fruit juices that may be made, from grapes, currants, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, loganberries, pineapples, peaches, pears, apricots and bananas; and that is not the half of them. In some of these instances the juice is obtained by forcing the pulp through a potato ricer or coarse sieve. How about cider, in its season? Figco, a California drink made from figs, is a wonderful health drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fruit juices, like fruits, are rich in the salts of sodium and potassium and increase the alkalinity of the blood and tissue fluids. The amount of food material in these juices is very large; nearly all of them, bulk for bulk, are of a food value comparable to milk. Strained honey in hot water makes an excellent drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And then there are the vegetable juices, oatmeal water, sauerkraut juice, onion juice, or pot liquor of any kind. Beet juice, celery juice, spinach juice, parsley juice; these are the things to drink. Licorice water makes a nice drink; so does mint. How about chocolate or cocoa? Why kill yourself with alcoholic or caffeine drinks when you can have an almost limitless number of fruit and vegetable drinks, inexpensive and ready to your hand, which will keep you in excellent physical condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Despicable Fraud</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">S THE Devil’s kingdom gathers momentum for its final plunge into oblivion, those who have given themselves over to their evil master’s control do meaner and ever meaner things, being egged on thereto by Gog and his confederates. The latest and one of the most des-picaole forms of fraud to come to light is set out in the following letter from one of Jehovah’s witnesses at Beloit, Wisconsin, addressed to Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am writing to give information that I believe you would wish to know. There are impostors in our territory using your name and soliciting money. They say they represent Judge Rutherford and the radio station over which your lectures are given. They ask for a contribution of one dollar and give nothing in return. They do not carry books or any literature from the Bible House. I also understand that your books are sold at the doors for a price not in accordance with instructions from the Watch Tower headquarters. How will the people know we are the true representatives? Should we show our permit and authorization card? I am requesting our workers to carry this card with them whenever they are in the service. Would appreciate a reply. Under the sharpshooter arrangement we have a splendid class of young people who are waking up to the Kingdom privileges and take part in the witness work. The book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font7"> is wonderful, and in the first two days we disposed of nearly all the supply assigned to us. We assure you of our prayers and support in this thrilling work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We were not privileged to see the personal reply which Judge Rutherford made to the foregoing letter, but we do have from him his consent to publish the following official warning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ANYONE soliciting money in behalf of the Society, its president or anyone connected with the Society, is doing wrong, and let all persons take notice that such persons are wholly unauthorized by the Society. Those engaged in the work of witnessing to the truth by means of the publications are authorized to do that work, but no one is authorized to go about and solicit money upon the pretext that he represents the WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY or its president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Announcements by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH’S kingdom is the most important thing ever to come to this planet. That kingdom is now here and functioning, in the midst of its enemies, while the kingdom of Satan is falling in ruins before the eyes of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford stands out as a spokesman for the kingdom of God. Just at present he is engaged in a series of Kingdom announcements that are of greatest importance. More than 200 radio stations are cooperating in getting these before the American radio audience, by electrical transcription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first of these announcements, of which there are six, was given over more than 125 stations on December 31. (See the list published on back page of our last issue.*) Since then the interest in these has increased and more stations are coming in on the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These announcements are being made on Sundays, 28 at 10: 00 o’clock; 10 stations at 10: 30;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’Nearly every station in the United States was invited to broadcast this program, with pay. Many of tho leading stations responded that they would gladly broadcast it in the public interest but had to refuse because they feared the ‘ ‘ power ’ ’ which they were told would be used ‘ to utterly ruin ’ them. Much of this “power” comes from Vatican City, near Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 at 1: 00 and 4: 00; 7 at 12: 00 and 12: 30. Other popular hours are 9: 30, 11: 30, 6: 30 and 7 : 00. Call up your radio station and find at what time these addresses will be broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following are the Kingdom announcements yet to be given. These are of paramount importance. Gather in your friends and neighbors and let them hear what may mean for them all the difference between life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">January 7 The True God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">14 The Mimic God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">21 Why Serve Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">28 Value of Knowledge and U </span><span class="font6">NDERSTANDING</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">February 4 Can the World Be Recovered?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After you have listened to each of these addresses, if you have been blessed and comforted and helped by them, why not telephone or write the radio station that has been instrumental in bringing you this blessing and tell them in your own words how much you appreciated it? There are plenty of people always glad to knock Judge Rutherford with the radio people; why not be one of those who will do something to help them see the good they are really accomplishing by broadcasting these Kingdom announcements?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Priests Took Back the Money They Paid to Judas</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font8">OBODY should be surprised that the priests took back the money they paid to Judas for the betrayal of the Lord. Priests are like that. We have a good illustration of how much principle they have, in a deal that they gave the Portland </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> is a stickler for freedom of speech and of the press, so it says. In numerous cartoons it ridiculed the Protestant clergy for their prohibition activities; it was careful never to ridicule the Catholic clergy. It owns two radio stations, KGW and KEX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two stations, KGW and KEX, at one time broadcast Judge Rutherford’s lectures. Suddenly the ‘stickler for freedom of speech and of the press’ stopped the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s lectures from either of them. The reason advanced was that Judge Rutherford had criticized and ridiculed the clergy. It seems that it makes a great deal of difference to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> who it is that exercises his freedom of speech with regard to the clergy, and which kind of clergy is discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the broadcasting was discontinued, it was hinted to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> management that they were probably doing this at the instance of the clergy. With that fine “sense of honor” which all men have come to recognize as inherent in Big Business concerns, they protested that such is not at all the case. They were just doing this of their own accord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And then, when Judas tried to fix it up with his guilty conscience, and asked the priests to keep their mouths shut, and when, if they had even the remotest grain of decency in their make-up, they would not have exposed him to the world, see what they did, in the following dispatch published in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font8"> Cleveland, Ohio. See how they have shown the management of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> as parties to their infamy, and begging them to keep still about it, and yet they go ahead and publish it, so that all may know what really happened. All can now see that the management of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> betrayed their real friends, and the friends of the people, and sold out to a bunch of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">hypocritical priests; then they lied about it, and </span><span class="font7">tory that they could not keep this letter of Mr. Allen’s</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">•when, in shame, they begged the priests to keep their infamy silent, they had to witness the following dispatch openly published:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Portland, Ore., Nov. 11. — Following protests lodged by the Rose City Sodality Conference and the Catholic Young People’s Society, stations KGW and KEX have discontinued the Judge Rutherford broadcasts. Announcement of the decision to withdraw the program from the air was made to the Catholic groups in a letter signed by Larry Allen, assistant manager of the Oregonian Radio Service. The letter follows: ‘Undoubtedly you will be interested in knowing that the Judge Rutherford transcriptions have been discontinued over both KGW and KEX. The reasons for discontinuing these broadcasts shall be kept private. If our stations have created any ill-will, we are indeed very sorry. However, you must understand that the trial and error method is our best guide in finding out what the public likes and what it dislikes.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">K. P. Loop, of Oregon, writing to Paul R. Heitmeyer, manager of the Oregonian Radio Service, at Portland, said succinctly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Evidently the Catholics felt so good over this vic-‘private . However, they showed Mr. Allen some consideration in that they sent it a long way from home to give it publicity. Many are asking why Judge Rutherford is not being heard over KGW any more, and now we can give them the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font7"> reason. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Loop did not like to leave Mr. Allen feeling that he had been neglected in his ministrations, and so he said also to him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I really feel that down in the hearts of both you and Mr. Heitmeyer you feel ashamed of the actions you have had to take; but the pressure is too strong, and in order to hold your jobs you have had to give in, as good jobs like you have are not so easy to find these days. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian</span><span class="font8"> will now, no doubt, favor its readers with some thrilling demands for freedom of speech and of the press, backed up by powerful cartoons of Judas in the guise of a publisher, driving a bargain with a gent dressed in a black nightshirt, and decked out with a three-story crown, and giving Judas about as raw a deal as a more or less honest and more or less courageous and more or less truthful publisher ever got.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE ten Roman Catholic priests on the Pacific coast that have been made chaplains of the Citizens’ Conservation Corps forest camps in that region will not be overworked. In addition to drawing down pay from Uncle Sam for five years as first lieutenants in the regular army, all they will have to do is to say mass once a week, preach a general sermon which is supposed to be good for everything from an itching scalp to ingrowing toenails, and have charge of the leisure time of all the boys in the camp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">B</span><span class="font8">USINESS being dull, and the church being $2,621.22 in the red, the rector of the Church of the Holy Comforter at Kenilworth, Illinois, got fifty bricks and bricked up the front door, stating that parishioners must use the side door until they bought the bricks across the front door at $5 per brick. This helped business and in a short while the $250 was raised. The pastor was so tickled that he is alleged to have said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Bedfellows</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I have made it one of the finest churches in the country, and I won’t let it slip if I have to build ten brick walls.” What a wonderful training this man is getting for his future work! He will be disappointed, however, if and when he gets into the honest business of bricklaying, to find that bricklaying jobs are hard to get, and the work is hard and dirty and dangerous. And he won’t be paid $5 a brick then, either.</span></p>

Suppose, now, that we send in five names of our nonCatholic friends, why do we have to send $5 to the Little Flower? and what do they get for it? And we are disturbed because we cannot send this $5 direct to the Little Flower, but have to send it to Mr. Coughlin.

Probably the best way out of it would be to quit and go into some honest line of work, like digging ditch or working on a railroad section.</span></p>

By his ardent support of the wet cause, he was one of those who helped put these very trucks on the road. Then suddenly the court of divine justice inflicted its penalty.” It would be an interesting experience to hear a good lawyer question Mrs. Peabody as to just who she thought was driving the beer truck on the day of the accident.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">octor Baird, of Toronto, sent us a couple of items. The first was a note from F. M. Lys-ter, pioneer witness. It was written from the Sherbrooke jail. That all seems regular; he was following the example of the Lord and the apostles, preaching the gospel from door to door, and the priests and preachers had him locked up. They were afraid, if he kept on, someone might learn something and it would interfere with their business. The second item throws light on the first. It was a clipping from the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font8"> expressing some surprise that last year the ministers of Ontario secured 400 liquor permits while the physicians of the province secured only 241.

We don’t seem to find any passage like that in the Bible, but, be that as it may, when the police searched the body of the janitor they found his gun had not been fired, and the janitor, before he died, also claimed that he had not fired at all. The “reverend” must have been excited, for he shot the janitor three times and another man once. He said he did not know how many times he fired. “Reverends” who murder their fellow men should be very particular to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about such experiences.</span></p>

We feel quite certain it never went anywhere else. ‘Thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet and shut the door,’ still remains in force. Still, if in these times of unemployment a class of people who have no regular occupation can take over $3.00 in cash for two minutes of prayer addressed to the legislators, who are we that we should complain ?

She stayed for about two hours and, by Jehovah’s grace, I was permitted to tell her about the Kingdom blessings, and, of course, about the two great organizations. She left, assuring me that she would not take her life. On May 31 she called back just as happy as she could be, saying the adjustment and her talk with Jehovah’s witness saved the day for her. And she is to be released from the psychopathic hospital next week. No doubt she will ‘get into the chariot’.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE editor of the Lynchburg </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font8"> observes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The effort sometimes is frenzied to make it appear that Abraham Lincoln was an orthodox Christian, though sometimes when forced to the wall recourse is had to the dubious argument that he wasn’t an atheist. And now there are those seeking to minimize the expressions on religion of Thomas Edison, who has just died. Church conferences seek to claim him for their own by adopting resolution expressing a sense of loss at his death, when, though science and invention may have lost, it is clear that religion has lost nothing. Others do. as is done in the case of Lincoln, reach out to pluck at least one little brand from the burning and proclaim him not an atheisf but a deist—something of a believer anyway. All this suggests the presence of fear that if a great man does not believe in the Christian religion the Christian religion loses, that the influence of one man can in measure at least counteract that of Christ himself. It is not reassuring to the waverers, but just the reverse. A faith that has to be thus buttressed is not impressive.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“A dog has a kennel off by itself, a little parsonage of its own, provided by others. It is housed in that kennel, kept warm, fed and chained to a certain post, so it cannot get loose. It has certain bounds it can travel. It is greedy for food and barks for more. Each dog must bark to suit his owner or he will be disposed of. There are different kinds of dogs, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Lutheran, Catholic, too numerous to mention. Some bring high prices, running up into the thousands. There are poodle dogs, lapdogs and bulldogs. When a dog gets game up a tree, the elders come around with collection boxes, shake the tree, and get what may chance to fall. There are sheep-killing dogs. ‘Beware of wolves in sheep’s clothing.’ ‘Beware of dogs.’ A dog has an easy time of it, but he must wear a collar with D.D. on it or the dog-catcher will get him, and it is only a step from that to frankfurters.”</span></p>

The case went on appeal to Judge Thomas C. Jones, of Versailles. In the face of overwhelming evidence in favor of the accused one, Judge Jones sustained the verdict of the lower court. A few weeks later, while entertaining friends at dinner, he was found dead on the lawn of his home. The account says: “His death was unexpected.” In view of the fact that we are now living in the Judgment Day, we can but wonder at this, and the question naturally arises if he may not have died as a result of the adverse judgment of Jehovah God upon his judicial handling of this case.</span></p>

On the lower slope are the ruins of the village of Argu-ri, believed to be the oldest village in the world. It was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1840. Armenians declare that when Noah came down from the top of Ararat with his family he settled in Arguri, and there planted his first grape vine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">N ELECTRIC hotbed is built by removing the topsoil and laying a heating cable back and forth across the bed, with the strands six or seven inches apart.

About six inches of soil are placed over the cable and the hotbed is ready for use. In some instances a thermostat is installed at the edge of the bed and the temperature is thus automatically controlled. The heat of manure is constant and dissipates in six weeks. Electricity can be turned on and off, and the results are better. In a California nursery devoted to the growing of young palm trees the rooting time has been cut down from three months to two months, and the percentage of rooting plants has increased from 65 to better than 90 by using the electric hotbed.</span></p>

The farmer thought the New Deal would suddenly give him a rise of about 180 percent in the price of his wheat, but the price stubbornly refuses to rise, because of the unprecedentedly large surplus of 350,000,000 bushels carried over from last year. Looks as if the government would have to do the same thing with the wheat that it did with the pigs. The desperate desire of the wise ones to produce a scarcity of everything or even of something is appreciated, and may work some time, but it does not work yet.</span></p>

At least one business man stands in with an agent and for only a few dollars has his life insured in old line companies for a good many thousands. He changes to a different company every year and never pays any but the first premium—he doesn’t pay that, only the fractional sum the agent must pay in to the company. Just as the prohibition law is evaded, just as gasoline is bootlegged to evade heavy tax, so there are insurance bootleggers violating all kinds of laws and getting by.

<h3><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>Radio Commission Under Fire</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">VER since the Canadian Radio Commission, at the instigation of the clergy class, violated every rule of justice and banned Judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rutherford’s inspiring lectures from the air, it has been under continual adverse criticism from people of all walks of life throughout Canada. Under the caption “Radio Commission Under Fire”, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Owen Sounder</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a Derry Day celebration in Guelph, Monday— Derry Day, is one of the anniversaries sacred in the heart of every Orangeman—considerable attention was given to the Canadian Radio Commission. The Orangemen evidently do not like the Radio Commission—in which attitude they are not alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the speakers at Guelph is reported as saying that the Commission is a one-sided affair; that neither its personnel nor its policy is representative of the views of the citizens of Canada who pay the license fees and the salaries of the Commissioners. He criticized as “an unhappy choice” the appointment of the chairman, Mr. Heetor Charlesworth, who in a book he published a few years ago proved his prejudice against the ideals which Orangemen as Protestants believe in and cherish. ‘ ‘ The radio programmes, ’ ’ he said, “are apparently designed to promote the false claim that French is an official language in every department of life in this country. The Commission is evidently a subservient one, using the air and our money for the promotion of racial and sectarian propaganda which is disliked and resented by the vast majority of the people of Canada.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are not directly interested in the doings of the Radio Commission; but we remember what a scrap there was in the House of Commons over its formation and the appointment of its members, especially the chairman. The Opposition speakers objected to-the appointments as purely political and were not backward in voicing their fear that the Commission might be used, in time of need, as a wing of the government, to broadcast only one side of the questions before the electors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We remember, too, that the Commission came in for some severe criticism when it bluntly—even rudely —refused to allow lectures by representatives of the International Bible Students’ Association to go on the air from any Canadian station. The reason for the Commission’s stand in that case was not far to seek, as the chairman, while editor of Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night,</span><span class="font7"> had printed a vicious attack on the leader of the Association a few months before, when the latter was speaking in Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are not holding any brief for either the Bible Students’ Association or the Loyal Orange Association; but it certainly does look as if there is something not just as it should be about the Radio Commission. With complaints coming from two so different sources ■—the reason given for shutting the I.B.S.A. off Canadian air was that it was preaching sedition and attacking the clergy; the very name of the Loyal Orange Association sufficiently indicates its stand for loyalty and religion—it appears that there is something wrong. It may, of course, be just another example of the old saying that “when both sides are abusing the referee he’s doing about right”; but that is not going to satisfy those who are complaining—who represent quite a large body of citizens. (After all, when you come to boil them down, both sets of complaints amount to this—that the Radio Commission is a prejudiced body, not giving the people what they want, but only what it thinks they should want.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have never thought Canada needed a Radio Commission any more than a cat needs a spare tire; but since there is one, our conception of its functions would be the provision of programmes—always, of course, within the bounds of decency—to suit everyone, so far as possible. Needless to say it is impossible to please everybody; but that is the advantage of radio—you can turn it off if you do not like what is coming over, or switch to some other station. The Commissioners should remember that they are there to serve a large and widespread clientele, including all sects, creeds and political views. If they are not doing that—and apparently they are not—then it is time for a change in personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But—here is the sticker—who is going to make the change? It almost looks as if this is another case of having to await a change of government. And perhaps that might be another case of “out of the frying pan into the fire”. Maybe the Government will appoint a commission to investigate the Radio Commission— chance here to give someone a job and spend some more of the people’s money.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Analysis of Canadian Population</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> contains the following interesting comment from its Ottawa correspondent concerning the matter of Canadian population. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each decennial census serves as a reminder that the problem of population is of paramount interest to the Canadian people, who need such reinforcements as economic conditions permit, if they are to make profitable use of their unoccupied spaces and vast physical equipment. Almost equal interest is taken in the story which the census tells of changes in the ratio of the different racial stocks which have gone to form the nation. The French Canadians, for instance, with their keen particularism, are always anxious to learn whether they are holding their own; they were acutely disappointed by the results of the first two censuses taken in the present century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most recent census, taken in June, 1931, has been recorded in a Bulletin which shows that the Brit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ish elements in Canada now have cause for anxiety about their numerical position. Its tables disclose that Canadians of British race, with 5,381,071 out of the total population of 10,376,786, still retain a numerical superiority over the aggregate of other races. The French come next, with 2,927,990. There are 473,554 Germans, 225,113 Ukrainians, 156,726 Hebrews, 145,-503 Poles, 122,911 Indians, 98,173 Italians, 93,283 Norwegians, and 88,418 Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is an ominous fact, in which advocates of Imperial migration will find useful argument, that the numerical preponderance of the British stock is by this latest evidence steadily shrinking. In 1901 it was 57.3 percent of the total population; in 1911, 54.08 percent; and now, after rising to 55.40 percent in 1921, it has fallen to 51.86 percent, leaving a narrow margin of superiority, which is obviously doomed to disappear before the next census unless a substantial inflow of British immigrants is resumed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>From the BUingual Standpoint</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle-Telegraph</span><span class="font8"> of Quebec speaks also concerning the 1931 census of Canada, but from the standpoint of bilingualism. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In connection with the 1931 Census, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics has made an interesting study of bilingualism throughout the country. How far the figures given in a statement recently made public may be regarded as accurate, we do not know. To tell the truth, we are decidedly skeptical because we have reason to know from experience that bilingualism as a matter of opinion and bilingualism as a matter of fact are two altogether different things. There are many people who will claim to be bilingual, if challenged, but who could not substantiate their claim if put to any practical test. And we do not know that the Bureau has based its calculations upon the results of any kind of examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At all events, this much may be said, that the figures obtained probably do give a certain idea of the general situation; that they are better than nothing and that it was highly commendable of the Bureau to think of collecting them. For whatever they may be worth, here they are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the total Dominion population of 10,376,786, we are told that 6,999,913 are exclusively English-speaking and 1,779,338 French-speaking; while 1,322,370 speak both English and French, and 275,165 speak languages other than French or English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Quebec there are 1,615,155 French-speaking citizens; 395,995 English-speaking, and 842,369 who speak both French and English. Ontario has 64,534 French-speaking Canadians and 219,532 who are bilingual. In New Brunswick there is a bigger French-speaking population than in Ontario, the number being 66,255, while in that province there are 74,080 persons who are bilingual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nova Scotia has 9,516 French-speaking citizens; Manitoba, 9,280; Saskatchewan, 7,059, and Alberta, 5,747. In Manitoba, 43,379 persons speak both French and English; in Saskatchewan, 44,463, and in Alberta, 32,992. In British Columbia there are only 361 persons speaking French exclusively, but the bilingual population numbers 21,119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing figures is that the use of the French language is increasing in the West. This probably means that French-Canadians continue to migrate from Quebec, or else that the families who have migrated continue to grow just as they do in this province.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>The Kingston Torture Chamber</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The revelation concerning the conditions in the Canadian prisons is so appalling that the Press simply will not let the matter drop, much to the sorrow of certain politicians and others who are responsible for the conditions. The Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font8"> recently published the following editorial concerning the matter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “paddle” which is administered to inmates of Kingston penitentiary who incur the warden’s displeasure is a heavy strap with holes in it which not only bruises its victims, but oftentimes rips off pieces of their skin. It is ordered without a public trial of any kind, and in many cases without any medical examination or attendance. The man who is to receive it is blindfolded and stretched on a table—tied and pinioned there so that he cannot move. Sometimes he goes unconscious during the ordeal. A case in point is that of Ernest Snell, who received a paddling in June of 1932, and whose uncontradicted evidence was given in the trial of Murray Kirkland at Kingston in April of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Snell was in the penitentiary under a court sentence of eight years and twenty lashes. In 1931, however, he was examined by the doctor (as is the rule where lashes are to be given in pursuance of a court order) and the doctor found he was not fit to receive them. He has a bad heart. He was accordingly exempted from the lashes, but no such exemption was available when the warden sentenced him to the paddle, an equally severe punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The paddle sentence was imposed because Snell resisted a guard and used abusive language. He told the court that the guard had struck him first and provoked the assault. At any rate, the man whom a medical examiner had declared unfit to receive twenty lashes ordered by a court was sentenced to twenty paddles by the prison warden. Ten were to be deferred and were, as a fact, never imposed, because, presumably, of what happened when the first ten were administered. Examined by Mr. W. M. Nickle, K.C., in the Kirkland trial, Snell told of this experience—of receiving ten lashes but remembering only four:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—Did you faint? A.—Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Q.—And when you came to, what were they doing ? A.—They were taking the straps off my wrists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Q.—You were strapped to the machine ? A.—Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—What effect did that paddle have on your body? &nbsp;A.—I was blue from my knees to my hips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—For how long? &nbsp;A.—I have marks yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—Did it break the skin? &nbsp;A.—Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—When you were taken out of the paddling machine and taken out of your cell, in what condition were your clothes? A.—They were all blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Q.—From the tears in your flesh, I suppose ? A.— From the effects of the paddle. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same witness described being three days in the “hole”, where his meals consisted of three slices of bread and a cup of water, his bed a few boards lying on the floor with blankets on them (the hole is below ground level), and where, from eight to eleven in the mornings and from one to four in the afternoons, he was shackled to the bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—Your hands were put through the bars with a bar between and shackled like that? A.—Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—At about chin level? A.—Round about chin level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Q.—And there is a bar in front of you across the gate that keeps your hands in that position? A.— Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Q.—And so you have got to stand ? &nbsp;A.—Yes, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Q.—For how many days did you stand like that? A.—Three days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this was in a Canadian prison in the enlightened twentieth century, and is routine punishment. Nor is Snell’s ease an isolated one. It is just one of many that emphasize the need for a thorough housecleaning at Kingston and a reform in our prison methods which will bring them into line with a civilized conception of what is due to humankind.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Paddle Worse than, the Lash</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">In a further editorial the same paper, under the caption “The Paddle Worse than the Lash”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the penitentiary reminiscences which he is contributing to the Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font7"> Dr. 0. C. J. Withrow says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Though lashes ‘by order of the court’ require the approval of the prison doctor and his presence at the ceremony, similar punishment by order of the warden requires nothing of the kind. In a few minutes a guard or keeper may have a man paddled with no examination or certification by the physician and without the order of any court. Guards have told me that the lashings ‘by order of the court’ are never as severe as paddlings by order of the warden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a similar series of articles in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maclean’s Magazine, </span><span class="font7">Mr. Austin Campbell tells what this “paddling” really means. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The paddling table is, in fact, just a specially prepared heavy table. The victim is compelled to bend over this (his arms stretched above his head) and his wrists are fastened. His ankles are shackled to the lower framework of the table, and a belt is fixed firmly across his back. His trousers are pulled down and his eyes are blindfolded. The paddle is a strap about three feet long by two inches wide. It is attached to a wooden handle. A series of holes, roughly diamondshaped, have been cut in the material, and as the strap strikes the flesh these holes break the skin, and, after a few blows, pieces of skin are pulled off by the strap. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the ease which Mr. Campbell describes, a convict was being flogged for refusing to “tell” on a guard who had supplied him with cigarette papers. A doctor was present. After ten strokes the convict still refused to speak. He was given ten more. “This,” says the writer, “is the story as told to me by the victim. Other inmates added that after his whipping this man was again confined in the hole, and that night his friends heard him sobbing in pain.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Brogues Made from Twine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Bennett, the prime minister, when running for election, promised, among other things, to do away with unemployment and to bring prosperity to the country, but things have gone from bad to worse. Under the title “Bennett Brogues Made from Twine” the following article appears in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From “Bennett buggies” made out of the chassis of defunct cars, stricken Saskatchewan farmers have gone on to “Bennett brogues”. These are shoes made out of the binder-twine which is used in tying bundles of wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pair of these “Bennett brogues” was forwarded to Ottawa this week for inspection. One enterprising farmer from near Broadview, Sask., has applied to the patent office here to see if he cannot obtain an exclusive patent. The patent office has replied that if the farmer has a new and distinctive device for making these “Bennett bootees”, he can secure such a document, but that it will take considerable research of existing patents to find that out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being a drought-stricken wheat-grower, he explained in a letter to Ottawa that he could not afford to go to any considerable expense to secure a patent, but that in any event he plans to go ahead and make shoes of various sizes this winter for sale among his neighbors. The writer, who is a Dane, says he believes he can make them for sale at as little as 50 cents a pair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The binder-twine shoes are tightly woven into a sort of rough fabric, with a built-up heel and sole. The only material used is binder-twine.</span></p>

He is the great fountain of life that supplies waters for the health and eternal happiness of those who fear Him and keep His commandments. “The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.” (Proverbs 14:27) Those who come to Him He invites to drink freely of this great fountain of life, and to them the path of life is opened with unmistakable clearness. To have the assurance of the Lord’s direction and approval brings joy and great confidence; this also leads to everlasting pleasures. “Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore,” At this time, while the world is in great darkness, it is absolutely necessary for the life of the creature that he be guided by the light which comes from above. The Lord strengthens such creatures as search for this light; and those who love Him are fearless in the sight of all that the enemy can bring against them. Those who travel in a dangerous and dark place are careful to have the necessary light, and it is customary to have some means of protection. While these are the usual precautions taken by the ordinary man, the Lord has made provisions for the safety of His people in this precarious time. Those who do not walk in the light of the Lord’s truth as it is now being revealed are certain sooner or later to be lost in the woods. For the encouragement of His people at this time the Lord caused to be written, “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid ?”—Psalm 27:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to be pleasing to Jehovah, who is the great Life-giver, it is absolutely necessary that one believe on Him through His Word. This belief must be sincere and should be backed up with confidence and action in His service. Those who love God will diligently seek Him and have the assurance of reward, not for self-gratification, but for promotion of His service. “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” (Hebrews 11:6) Concerning Abraham it is written, “He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.” (Romans 4: 20) It is the most reasonable thing to expect, that the creature should have faith in his benefactor who commands all the power in the universe in the accomplishment of His purposes. Those who do have faith will manifest that faith by activity in doing Jehovah’s bidding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this consideration of the Life-giver it is well to examine some of the scriptures showing how Jehovah gave immortal life to His Son, Christ Jesus, and how by the resurrection of His faithful Son He assures life to all members of the human family who cooperate with God for the purpose of being an everlasting praise to the Creator. It is important at the very outset to recognize that Jehovah by His power raised Jesus from the dead. It was on the day of Pentecost that Peter stood up before the Jews and related how Jehovah God, whom the faithful prophets served, had raised up Jesus from the dead. While the Israelites had been the favored people of Jehovah and had the privilege of serving Him, yet through unbelief they had lost many opportunities to show their devotion to Him. He refers to Jesus “whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it”. (Acts 2: 24) It was on the day of Pentecost that, by the sending of the holy spirit, Jehovah gave an outward demonstration that Jesus had been raised. The listeners not only saw, but they heard also, for the spirit was manifested by cloven tongues as of fire and as a rushing of a mighty wind; the manner also in which Peter spoke bore evidence of God’s power. “This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the [holy spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.” (Acts 2:32,33) The point to be emphasized is that the resurrection and the assurance of life to those who believe were made possible only by Jehovah, the great Life-giver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus was put to death in the flesh and was resurrected a divine creature. (1 Peter 3:18) God had promised to grant unto Him the divine life, giving Him the power and authority to have </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">inherent</span><span class="font8"> life. Only divine persons have life within themselves and need nothing to sustain life. Jesus said: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:26) When on earth He was a man. When He was raised from the dead He was the express image of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God. “Who being the brightness of his [Jehovah’s] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” (Hebrews 1:3,4) He was begotten of God’s holy spirit at the time of His baptism in the Jordan. He was born as divine at His resurrection. When He was raised from the dead He was both Lord and Christ. (Acts 2:36) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lord</span><span class="font8"> means one who owns; one who has power and authority, and one whom His followers acknowledge as Master and Lord. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font8"> means the anointed one, the one appointed by Jehovah to carry out His great purpose. So now, being raised from the dead, He is both owner of all things and endowed with power and authority to carry out Jehovah’s purpose. The name </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font8"> means Savior of the people. That was His earthly name. It is more particularly associated with Him as the sin-bearer, or one who made his soul an offering for sin, who suffered for us and who bore our sins, the one whom the prophet describes as the “man of sorrows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When He was raised from the dead Jehovah highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above all other names. He was once a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Now, resurrected from the dead, He is the exalted One; hence the apostle declares: “Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the [tree]. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—Philippians 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God has decreed that since the earth was the scene of Jesus’ suffering it shall be the scene of His glory, and all creatures shall bow at the name of Jesus, and that every creature shall confess that Jesus is Christ and is Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the day Jesus was raised from the dead and on several occasions thereafter He appeared unto His disciples and others who specially loved Hun. He did not appear to them in the same body that was crucified; nor with the same clothing in which He was buried. The Scriptural account is that the clothing and a napkin were folded up and laid aside in the tomb. Had He appeared in the same body that was crucified, those who were with Him for three and a half years would have readily recognized Him. Surely Mary would have known Him. He appeared to her as a gardener on one occasion, and only when He spoke her name, in the tone so familiar to her, did she recognize Him. The Scriptural account of His appearing to the disciples and other witnesses is briefly noted as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He appeared on Sunday morning, early in the day of His resurrection, to Mary Magdalene near the sepulcher at Jerusalem.—John 20:1118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the same Sunday morning, to the women returning from the sepulcher.—Matthew 28:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the same Sunday morning, to Simon Peter alone near Jerusalem.—Luke 24:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the same day, to two disciples going to Emmaus, between Jerusalem and Emmaus. —Luke 24:13-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the same Sunday evening, to the apostles (except Thomas) at Jerusalem.—John 20:19-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thereafter He appeared again one week later (Sunday evening) to the apostles, Thomas this time being present, at Jerusalem.—John 20: 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some days thereafter He appeared on the shores of Galilee to seven of His disciples who had gone back to fishing.—John 21:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A little later He appeared to the eleven disciples on a mountain near Galilee.—Matthew 28: 16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A short time thereafter He again appeared to a company of more than five hundred of His followers, gathered by appointment, in Galilee. —1 Corinthians 15: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He again appeared to the apostle James only. —1 Corinthians 15:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then He appeared, for the last time, on the side of the Mount of Olives to His disciples at the time of His ascension.—Luke 24:50,51; Acts 1:6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The question will arise in the minds of many, Did He appear in a spirit body or a human body? and- how did He get the body if it was not the one in which He was crucified? We may be sure that He was not raised from the dead with a human body, because on one of these occasions He appeared to the disciples when they were in a room with the doors fastened. (John 20:19-26) The only answer is that now, divine, He had the power to create a body and clothing and appear at any time and upon any occasion that He desired. Mary supposed Him to be a gardener; two of the disciples who walked with Him thought He was a stranger in the community. Again, on the sea of Galilee, none of the disciples recognized Him by His body; likewise on other occasions when He appeared unto them. On all these occasions He was recognized by His actions, His words, and the familiar tone of His voice. It was hard to convince Thomas, who declared he must have some more proof; therefore the Lord created a body having in it the marks of the nails, in order that Thomas might be convinced. And when he was convinced, Jesus said to him: “Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”—John 20:27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The purpose of Jesus’ appearing to the disciples was that the fact might be fully established that He was resurrected and alive. He had the power to create a fleshly body and appear in it and dissolve it at any time; and without doubt when He appeared to His disciples behind locked doors He created the body immediately in their presence and dissolved it when He disappeared. To prove to them that He had a real body of flesh and bones He said to them: “Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” (Luke 24:39) That was not a spirit body, but a body of flesh. The body with which He ascended on high and which He has in heaven is a glorious body which no man can look upon and live except by the miraculous power of Jehovah. The apostle Paul states: “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Corinthians 15: 50, 51) In addition to this, John says: “It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”—1 John 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul was given a miraculous view of the Lord in glory. As he was journeying to Damascus suddenly there shone about him a light from heaven. He did not see the body of Jesus, but only the light from His glorious body. He heard a voice saying unto him: “I am Jesus.” So brilliant was this light that for three days he was blind; and the Lord performed a miracle by removing his blindness. “And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.” (Acts 9:1-19) The apostle Paul afterward relating this incident said: “And last of all he [Jesus] was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.” (1 Corinthians 15: 8) Here we have a glimpse of what the glorious body of the Lord is. These facts show that the bodies in which Jesus appeared after His resurrection were neither the body that was crucified nor His glorious spiritual body, but bodies created expressly for the purpose of appearing unto His disciples. Our Lord’s human body, the one crucified, was removed from the tomb by the power of God. The Scriptures do not reveal what became of that body, except that it did not decay or corrupt. (Acts 2:27,31) Had it remained in the tomb it would have been an obstacle in the way of the faith of Jesus’ disciples, who were not yet instructed in spiritual things. They were not thus instructed until the giving of the holy spirit at Pentecost. The Scriptures tell us that God miraculously hid the body of Moses (Deuteronomy 34:6; Jude 9); and Jehovah could just as easily have hidden away the body of Jesus. Jesus being resurrected divine, the express image of the Father, we are sure that no man could look upon Him and live. (Exodus 33: 20) Christ Jesus the Lord in heaven is a most glorious person, the fairest of ten thousand, altogether lovely, and no human eye has ever seen Him since glorified, except in the vision miraculously given to Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The purpose of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, when understood, is further proof that He was raised divine. As we have seen, the ransom must be provided by a perfect human creature going into death. This ransom price, namely, the value of a perfect human life, must be presented in heaven itself as a sin-offering on behalf of mankind. Unless this were done, the ransom would be of no avail and there would be no purchase of the human race from death and its results. The apostle Paul plainly states that Christ Jesus has entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. (Hebrews 9: 24) He is now a great high priest who passed into the heavens, becoming the high priest on behalf of those who come to God through Him. (Hebrews 4:14-16) On the typical atonement day, observedby the ancient Jews once each year, God caused Israel through the priesthood to make a picture of the sin-offering. The high priest appearing in the most holy of the tabernacle or temple and sprinkling the blood upon the mercy seat was a type of Jesus appearing in heaven itself, presenting the merit of His sacrifice as a great sin-offering. This would have been impossible had not Jesus been resurrected divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Afterward Jesus Christ gave unto John a revelation by His angel, which record exists today as the Bible book The Revelation. In that He said: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Revelation 1:18) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hell</span><span class="font8"> means the tomb, the grave, the condition of death into which the whole human race has been going for so many centuries. Death is the great enemy, and in due time the Lord will destroy both death and the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As each person comes to a knowledge of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and understands and appreciates its purpose his heart is made glad. Only those who are enlightened have yet appreciated the fact that the resurrection of Jesus is one of the strings (fundamental doctrines) on God’s wonderful harp. In due time these benefits will be made known to all, and all shall recognize this wonderful truth. After the Lord has finished the selection of the members of His body, which is called the church (Colossians 1:18), then His merit or ransom sacrifice will be presented on behalf of the world of mankind and all obedient ones will reap the benefits of His resurrection. The foregoing scriptures conclusively establish the resurrection of Christ Jesus from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Paul’s day there were some who denied the resurrection, even as it has been ever since. To meet their argument Paul wrote: “Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”—1 Corinthians 15: 12-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and His ascension on high, all men are guaranteed one full, fair opportunity to obtain everlasting life. God has made this provision and given this guarantee, as Paul states. “Because he [God] hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” (Acts 17:31) We are now just coming into that ‘appointed da/, in which the world is beginning to know and soon will know much more about the wonderful benefits resulting from the resurrection of our Lord. In this great day the Lord reigns in glory and soon shall be fulfilled His words: “Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.”—John 5:28,29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">We see,</span><span class="font8"> therefore, on examining the subject Jehovah the Great Life-giver, that the credit and praise for the abundant provision made for all His creatures must be given to the Creator, the great Fountain of Life. As freely as the flowing waters has He provided His Word of truth, which if a man drinks he has life. One appreciating the loving provisions of Jehovah cannot do anything else than serve Him throughout eternity. At the present time the message of life is being heralded as never before. Great are the privileges of even human creatures to share with Jehovah’s King and Vindicator in the work of honoring Jehovah and bringing the life-giving waters to the dying race of mankind. We have noted that Jehovah made provision for the salvation of the human family through the death and resurrection of His dear Son, who on account of His obedience was raised to the divine life and given the power to extend life and its blessings to creatures here on earth. Soon the peoples of earth, liberated from the bondage of the satanic reign, will sing for joy to the praise of the great Life-giver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">T A MEETING of the Detroit conference of the Methodist Episcopal church held at Ypsilanti, Prof. Harry F.

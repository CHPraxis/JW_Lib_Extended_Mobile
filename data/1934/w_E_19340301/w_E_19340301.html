<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS NAME</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Blessed be the name of Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.”—Ps. 113: 2, A.Tl.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S NAME was exalted by all intelligent creatures. All knew and delighted in his illustrious fame and honorable reputation. All knew that Jehovah was and is the source of life and that he is the unselfish Giver of every good and perfect gift. Such was the proper and happy state existing in the universe until lawlessness found a place in the heart of the creature whom Jehovah had made lord over a part of his organization. Coveting that which had not been given to him Lucifer exalted himself, defied the Most High, and received for himself the title of Satan, and God set a time limit for the continuation of Satan, at which time limit the wicked one must end. (Jer. 51:13) The name of Jehovah for centuries has been reproached, dishonored and made infamous by Satan and by his host of wicked angels and wicked men. The crisis has come, and from this time forth and for evermore the name of Jehovah shall be exalted. The wicked shall perish, and all who receive life everlasting must know and obey and honor and joyfully serve him whose name alone is Jehovah. His illustrious fame and honorable reputation must find a place in the mind of every creature that lives. He has taken out from amongst the nations of earth a people for his name, and to them is given the privilege of now proclaiming his great and honorable name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Centuries ago God began to bring his name before fallen men. He revealed to Moses his name Jehovah; then to Egypt Jehovah ‘went to redeem unto himself a people and to make him a name’. (2 Sam. 7:23) God did not bodily appear in Egypt, but he sent Moses as his servant, and thus Jehovah appeared there in a representative capacity. Egypt was a type of the world, and Pharaoh its ruler was a type of Satan, the god of this wicked world. Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and Servant by whom Jehovah redeems a people for himself and causes the name of the Most High to be put in the right place in the mind of all intelligent creatures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In his due time Jehovah will cause all of his creatures to know his name and its meaning and to have in memory the time when he first revealed his name to man as Jehovah; and that memorable time dates from the time of his going to Egypt. A memorial marks a day or time certain when some great thing is done and which is to be ever afterwards remembered. Among the great things performed by Jehovah by his servant Moses were these: The revelation of his name, the making of the law covenant, the destruction of Pharaoh’s organization, and the deliverance of the Israelites from that oppressive organization. The pivotal point of these great events was the slaying of the passover lamb, because it pointed to the One whom God had ordained should be the vindicator of his great and holy name. All the things performed in Egypt by man as God’s representative and servant were incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which is the all-important thing. For this reason Jehovah said to Moses: “This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” (Ex. 3:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Because the slaying and eating of the paschal lamb pointed to Jesus, the vindicator, Jehovah said to Moses: “And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.” (Ex. 12:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.</span><span class="font3">V.) Wh* n the time came for the fulfilment of the type by ti.;&gt; death of Jesus Christ he said to his disciples concerning the bread which he broke in their presence and asked them to eat: “This is [represents] my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) The time must come, as Jesus knew, when his true followers must and would understand that his faithfulness unto death, and his death in the place and stead of the sinner, were not merely to furnish the redemptive price for man, but also to prove his own qualifications to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name. Being thus perfected, Christ Jesus became Jehovah’s “high priest for ever”, the executioner of Satan and his organization, and the vindicator of Jehovah’s name and the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. (Ileb. 2:14; 5:6-10) Thc_greatest thing to be kept in memory is the name of Jehovah, and Paul intimated that at the coming of Jesus to the temple this important truth would clearly be understood. (1 Cor. 11:26) By partaking of the “Lord’s supper” until the coining of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah his faithful dis-ciplcs have shown forth the Lord’s death; but now those faithful ones gathered by the Lord Jesus unto himself are ‘drinking the fruit of the vine with him new’, and all are rejoicing and praising the name of Jehovah and must do so for ever. “Thy name, 0 Lord, cndureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.”—Ps. 135:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COVENANT—LAW AND NEW</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘ Jehovah God made the law covenant by Moses as the mediator for Israel while in Egypt and at the time of the slaying of the paschal lamb. The inauguration of the law covenant took place in the season of Pentecost or about fifty days after the Israelites were brought out of Egypt and had come to Mount Sinai (Mount Horeb). (Ex. 19:1) The making of the new covenant was marked by the death of Jesus, the antitypical passover Iamb, on the fourteenth day of Nisan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D. </span><span class="font3">33. The inauguration of the new covenant is marked by the final outpouring of the holy spirit “upon all flesh”. (Joel 2: 28, 29 ; Acts 2:16-18) The “Lord’s supper” as a memorial of his death, instituted in AI). 33, and for centuries thereafter observed by his faithful follower's, calls attention to the making of the new testament or new covenant and keeps the same in memory. “For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">sins.” (Matt. 26:28) “After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This eup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.”— 1 Cor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11:</span><span class="font3">25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’From and after the year 1919 (A.D.), and particularly from 1922, until Jehovah's witnesses pass from the earth, the “Lord's supper” not only calls attention to the death of Jesus the Redeemer and Vindicator, but also directs attention to the inauguration of the new covenant, which covenant operates to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSPIRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Satan and all of his earthly representatives, meaning Pharaoh and his subjects who obeyed him, had formed a conspiracy to destroy the Israelites and to thus prevent them from being a nation. (Ex. 1:15,16; 2:23,24) God heard the cries of the Israelites, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">law covenant made by him for Israel was an assurance in type that for Jehovah's name’s sake that people would be brought forth and preserved. The Abrahamie covenant was involved, because Jehovah had given his word that he would bring forth a seed; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">now Jehovah had respect to his covenant with Abraham.—Ex. 2:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">24,</span><span class="font3">25;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6:4, </span><span class="font3">5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> At the time of the making of the new covenant Satan and his crowd, including his earthly priests and clergymen, conspired to destroy Jesus. (Matthew 21:38) In carrying out this conspiracy Jesus, the antitypical lamb of God, was slain, but Jehovah preserved the ones with whom his new covenant was made. (John 17:11-15; Phil. 2: 9-11) At the inauguration of the new covenant again a conspiracy is formed by Satan and his crowd, including his Roman Catholic hierarchy and other religionists, to kill those who faithfully praise the name of Jehovah and to thereby “cut them off from being a [holy] nation”, and overt acts were and are now being committed in furtherance of that wicked conspiracy. (Ps. 83:1-18; 1 Pet. 2: 9,10; Zech. 13: 7-9) Jehovah has preserved his faithful and hidden ones who are in the covenant, because they are under the shadow of his wing and have been selected for his purpose; and, they continuing faithful, he will preserve them for ever.—Ps. 91 :l-4; 145: 20; Isa. 54:17 ; 42: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VENGEANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah expressed his vengeance against Satan’s organization by slaying the firstborn of Egypt at the time the paschal Iamb was killed. At the death of Jesus, the antitypical passover lamb, the firstborn of antitypical Egypt, that is to say, of this world, did not die. The reason therefor now clearly appears and shows that the time is rapidly approaching when the firstborn of antitypical Egypt must die. As the blood of the passover lamb sprinkled on the doorposts of the houses in Egypt signified life and preservation to those who remained inside the house and under the protection of that blood-sign, so those trusting in the precious blood of Christ Jesus, and who have been in and who remain in the new covenant, have this added assurance of life and preservation; hence the “Lord's supper” properly celebrated by such for centuries past has ‘shown forth the Lord’s death till he come’ and has been a guarantee of their preservation. Now, however, the Lord has come, and his shed blood in a marked degree bespeaks that this is the day of Jehovah’s vengeance and destruction of Satan’s firstborn of this world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font3"> is the day of God's vengeance; hence all who properly celebrate the Lord’s supper now must certainly show their consistency by proclaiming the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">day </span><span class="font3">of the vengeance of our God against the enemy ’s firstborn who are not under the blood. This must be done in fulfilment of the divinely given commandment: “Proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isa. 61:2) As Aaron acted as the mouthpiece and proclaimer for Moses (who was a type of Christ Jesus) in proclaiming the vengeance of God against Pharaoh and his organization, even so now those in the covenant with Christ Jesus must likewise proclaim the vengeance of God against Satan's firstborn and all of his organization, because they “have the testimony of Jesus Christ” and keep God’s commandment. (Ex. 4:22,23; Rev. 12:17) Those who would partake of the memorial supper and then fail or refuse to obey the commandments to be Jehovah's witnesses would thereby partake unworthily: “For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, cateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.”—1 Cor. 11:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SHEPHERDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The Egyptians hated shepherds and refused to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">eat </span><span class="font3">with the Hebrews for that reason, such being </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font3">abomination unto the Egyptians. (Gen. 43: 32; 46:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">34) </span><span class="font3">When Jehovah’s time came to make a name for himself in Egypt he sent </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">shepherd down there to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font3">liver his testimony, to lead out the people from Egypt and to act as the law covenant’s mediator. Satan and his earthly crowd hate the servants of Jehovah </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God who </span><span class="font3">bring the divinely provided food to I lis flock </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">thus act in the capacity of undershepherds, which hatred is especially made manifest in this present </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">day. At </span><span class="font3">the time of the making of the new covenant, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">also at the time of the inauguration thereof, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah </span><span class="font3">God sends the “good shepherd”, the “chief shepherd”, Christ Jesus, and both Christ Jesus and those to whom he commits the work of carrying the divinely provided food to the people, who hunger for righteousness, are wickedly hated by Satan and all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">earthly priests, clergymen and dupes. (John </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10:11; </span><span class="font3">1 Pet. 5: 2-4) This is further proof that those who </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">with Christ Jesus at the temple must bear and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font3">bear or carry the fruits of the kingdom, that is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">say, the life-giving truths of God’s Word, to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font3">in the world who have the hearing ear, and at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font3">lime declare God’s vengeance against the enemy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">his organization, and that such faithful ones will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">and are hated and persecuted by Satan and his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">serv</span><span class="font3">ants. The Roman Catholic hierarchy and others </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">like stripe now manifest their wickedness and hatred against Jehovah’s witnesses because these witnesses speak that which is to the honor of the name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jeho</span><span class="font3">vah God and the Lord Jesus Christ.—John 15:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">19-23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The shepherd Hoses was in the mount of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Horeb </span><span class="font3">(Sinai) when Jehovah drew him aside by attracting him to the burning bush and there spoke to him </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">directed Moses to go to Egypt and to deliver the testimony of God to Pharaoh. It was in that mountain at that time that Jehovah referred to the inauguration of the law covenant when he, addressing Moses, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">said: </span><span class="font3">“Certainly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">will be with thee; and this shall </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font3">token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">serve </span><span class="font3">God upon this mountain.” (Ex. 3:1-12) Jehovah made the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font3">covenant at the death of Jesus, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">naw he </span><span class="font3">discloses to his faithful ones at the temple that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the new </span><span class="font3">covenant is inaugurated at Mount Zion, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">where </span><span class="font3">the 144,000 followers of Christ Jesus are gathered </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font3">Christ Jesus unto himself. (Rev. 14:1-3) The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">faith</span><span class="font3">ful remnant now celebrate the Lord’s supper at Mount Zion, that is, in Jehovah God’s organization, rejoicing at the inauguration of the new covenant, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">they continue to proclaim the name of Jehovah.— Hob. 12:22-25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LAND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> God’s covenant with Abraham is the uncondition</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">al </span><span class="font3">promise, and which promise is irrevocable, that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font3">hovah will carry into operation his purpose to bless all the families of the earth through his seed. Satan for a long while has been god or miler over the earth, but Jehovah’s purpose is that Satan’s rule now must for ever end, and Jehovah takes over the earth and its fullness for himself and gives all this to his beloved Son. To Abraham Jehovah said: “For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.” (Gen. 13:15) In this prophetic statement made to Abraham by Jehovah Abraham represented God, while his seed referred to His Christ. (Gal. 3:16-29) Now' he whose right it is to rule has come, and Jehovah God has installed him, Christ Jesus, upon “his throne, and he has begun his rule. (Ezek. 21:27; Ps. 2:6; 110: 2) Jehovah will now completely and for ever deprive Satan and his crowd of every part of the earth and will completely fulfil his word addressed to his Beloved, the Seed, to wit: “Ask of me, and I shall give thee the [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Ps. 2:8,9) Christ Jesus is therefore the rightful possessor of all the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> There is no Scriptural reason to conclude that the man Abraham and his descendants will inherit the earth. God’s promise to Abraham was lulliilcd in miniature and in a typical manner, but the greater fulfilment is to those of Jehovah’s organization. The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fullness thereof. (Ps. 24:1) The overlordship of the earth now belongs to Christ Jesus, the Seed of Abraham, whose right it is to rule, because Jehovah has given it to him. Christ. Jesus is Jehovah’s heir of all things, and those of his royal house are joint-heirs with him. (Rom. 8: 16,17) When Ged said to Abraham, ‘I will give unto thee ami unto thy seed after thee the land,’ clearly the meaning thereof is that Abraham in type was given the land and his Seed, the Christ, will possess it for ever. Of and concerning his faithful and obedient followers Christ Jesus spoke, saying: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matt. 5: 5) In 1914 Jehovah gave to Jesus the whole earth and the right to rule the same. Later Jesus gathered unto himself the faithful and brought them into the temple, and those of the. remnant who continue faithful to the end shall participate in this great and marvelous gift. Christ Jesus is now at the temple in the kingdom with his followers and, to be sure, it is a time of rejoicing, pictured by the ‘drinking of the wine new with him in his Father’s kingdom’. Jehovah has therefore fulfilled his promise to give all the land to the seed of Abraham, that is, to Christ Jesus; and the “meek” mentioned by the Lord who shall inherit the land, being the teachable and obedient ones, that is to say, the faithful members of his body, these inherit the earth with him for ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Nor is there any Scriptural reason to conclude that Abraham and the ether faithful men of old shall </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font3">be ehanged from human to spirit creatures, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as we once </span><span class="font3">thought. Their position, as the Scriptures </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">clearly </span><span class="font3">show, will be that of ‘‘princes in all the earth”, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that is to say, </span><span class="font3">the visible governors of earth, the direct </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">rep</span><span class="font3">resentatives of Christ to whom God has given </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">earth as his inheritance, and as such princes they will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">rule </span><span class="font3">under Christ and rule in righteousness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ps. 2:6-8; </span><span class="font3">Isa. 32:1) The faithful remnant now taught </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Jehovah God see that the kingdom is here, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">righteousness in the earth must and will shortly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">in full control, all of which will constitute a vindication of Jehovah’s name, and therefore those faithful ones rejoice and sing the praises of Jehovah and declare </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">mighty doings amongst the people. The meeting of the faithful remnant with the new princes in the earth will be a joyful one, and they arc looking forward to it with joyful anticipation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSISTENCY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> If the blood of the new covenant has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font3">sprinkled and that covenant has been inaugurated, then it necessarily follows that Jehovah has brought forth and made manifest the ones mentioned as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“a </span><span class="font3">people for his name” and that he has given them </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“a </span><span class="font3">new name”; and upon none other than his covenant servant people does God confer that honor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sneh </span><span class="font3">faithful members of the remnant yet on earth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font3">partake of the “Lord’s supper” at Mount Zion, drinking the new wine with the chief one of the royal </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">house, </span><span class="font3">because they have had his invitation and entered into the joy of the Lord. (Matt. 25:21) They must </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font3">be consistenLand act their part and speak their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font3">as a people for Jehovah’s name; otherwise they </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">not acting in harmony with the drinking of the wine new, the symbol of the blood of the new covenant. They must now therefore preach Jehovah God’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">name </span><span class="font3">and his kingdom. This is not discretionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font3">it is absolutely mandatory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> It would not be permissible to ask for a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">license or a </span><span class="font3">permit to be issued by worldly institutions </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">preach the gospel of God’s kingdom any more than it would have been proper for Moses and Aaron to ask permission of Pharaoh to worship God. “And </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">after</span><span class="font3">ward Moses and Aaron went in, and told </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pharaoh, </span><span class="font3">Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.” (Ex. 5:1) On other occasions Moses and Aaron </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font3">livered a like message to Pharaoh. (Ex. 7:16; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">8:1; 9:1) </span><span class="font3">Such, however, was not a request that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pharaoh </span><span class="font3">or his officers should issue a permit or license to worship or to serve Jehovah, but the same constituted </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">demand </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">made </span><span class="font3">by the express commandment of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jeho</span><span class="font3">vah that Pharaoh and his officers must quit interfering with the chosen people of God in the exercise </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">their liberty to freely worship and serve Jehovah. Even so now the people taken out for Jehovah’s name, to wit, the remnant, are sent forth by Jehovah </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">commanded to bear testimony before the rulers, and it would be wholly inconsistent for them to ask the rulers if they might preach the gospel, but it is their business to demand that Satan and his representatives cease their interference with Jehovah’s witnesses in delivering the gospel of his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">, '<sup>18</sup> Pharaoh not only was notified of God’s purpose, but was granted full time and opportunity to identify himself as God’s enemy by ‘putting on the garments’ and showing on which side he stood. He was notified and warned of what God would do if he continued to interfere with his people, and notwithstanding this notice and warning he continued to harden his heart: “And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.” (Ex. 7:14) Now the earthly representatives of Satan are given full warning, time and opportunity to put on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">garments of identification before Jehovah takes final action against them. The supremacy of Jehovah must be made known to the rulers, and his witnesses must declare God’s supremacy and the greatness of his name throughout the earth. (Ex. 9:16, Lcc.scr) It therefore must be displeasing to Jehovah God for anyone to ask permission of the antitypical Pharaoh and his officers that he might go about and preach the gospel. Since God has commanded this notice of warning to be given, Jehovah’s servants must obey his commandments.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The rod of Moses became a serpent when cast down before Pharaoh and was a symbolic warning of the woes to come upon Pharaoh and his organization, culminating in the destruction of the firstborn of Egypt and the destruction of Pharaoh’s host in the Red sea. In the year 1918 the Lord Jesus came to the temple for judgment, to which high position Jehovah had assigned him. He there appears as Jehovah’s special representative clothed with all power and authority; hence at that time began the fulfilment of the prophetic utterance: “Jehovah is in his holj<sup>r</sup> temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (llab. 2-20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AJt.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The rod in the hand of the antitypical Moses is a symbol of the authority and power which Jehovah has fully delegated to Christ Jesus and which he uses to execute Jehovah’s purposes. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">1933, page 100, and scriptures there cited.) Now the announcement to the rulers of the world that Christ Jesus, the great Judge, has come to the temple for judgment is a warning to all such of the punishment God will inflict upon his enemies culminating in the complete destruction of the world at Armageddon. Tjie rod of Moses was employed by Moses and Aaron in invoking the ten plagues upon Egypt, including the death of the firstborn. In this connection Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, while Aaron pictured the members of the body of Christ to whom is committed “the testimony of Jesus Christ” and who deliver the testimony. That rod stretched forth symbolically said that this is done by the authority and commandment of Jehovah God. The plagues upon Egypt constituted notice and warning of God’s purpose to execute his wrath against all those who oppose him in carrying out his purposes. Nine of those plagues preceded the institution of the passover. The slaying of the paschal lamb and the institution of the first passover was directly interwoven with the tenth plague. It is certain that the Scriptures prove that the expression of God’s vengeance against the antitypical Egypt takes place after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment, and it also clearly follows that the ten plagues have an antitypical fulfilment upon the world of Satan following the appearing of the Lord at the temple for judgment, and that these plagues have an antitypieal fulfilment before the complete expression of God’s vengeance against Satan’s organization. That conclusion being correct, the memorial of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, the antitypical passover’ lamb, now signifies much more to God’s people than they have heretofore seen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> It is certain that we arc now in the last days, concerning which the ai&gt;ostle Paul said: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 </span><span class="font3">Tim. 3:1) This is the time in which the “man of sin’’, “the son of perdition,’’ is made manifest. The clergy in general, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy in particular, and others that go to make up the “man of sin’’, are described by the apostle in 2 Timothy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3:2-9. </span><span class="font3">Those persons, while claiming to represent God and his kingdom, are violently opposed to the king</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dom </span><span class="font3">and have persecuted those whom Jehovah has taken out as a people for his name and who are delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ. These opposers </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Jehovah have had every opportunity to hear the truth, but they refused to learn and to give heed to the truth; therefore they put on the garments of Baal and plainly identify themselves with God’s great enemy, concerning which the apostle prophetically wrote: “Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambrcs withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font3">of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font3">they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.’’ (2 Tim. 3:7-9) It now appears to those devoted to the Lord that the ten plagues upon Egypt were prophetic. If those plagues, or even a part of them, have had an antitypical fulfilment, may we not now expect the Lord to show to his faithful ones the meaning thereof and also to permit them to sec what all those plagues mean? (Isa. 42:9) A consideration of those ten plagues in Egypt in connection with the memorial of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ now seems to be very appropriate.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PLAGUES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah speaks of the plagues upon Eg.vpt as “wonders’’ and “signs”. (Ex. 3:20; 8:23; 10:1) “And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 7: 3) “How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan. ” (Ps. 78:43) It does not follow that the antitypieal fulfilment of these signs and wonders or plagues would be in the same </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font3"> order as they occurred in type. They differ in time order from the seven last plagues described in Revelation sixteen, the one exception appearing to be that of the last plague. Seeing that the Scriptures were written aforetime for the instruction, assurance and comfort of the remnant, it is reasonable to expect that these signs and wonders will be made known to the remnant while on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> One of the reasons why Jehovah has permitted Satan to remain and continue his nefarious work in all the centuries past is stated by him as “that my name may be declared throughout all the earth”. (Ex. 9:1G, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.lt.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The declaring of Jehovah’s name through the earth takes place at the end of the world, and'following the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple God uses iiis people taken out for his name in connection therewith, just as he used Moses and Aaron in Egypt: “He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.” (Ps. 105:26,27) The antitypieal Moses and Aaron constitute Jehovah’s servant whom Jehovah has commissioned to bear his message to the world. Christ Jesus is the Head of that servant and was pictured by Moses, whereas Aaron pictured the body members, including the remnant. Jehovah speaks of his witnesses, applying his words to the “day of the Lord”, which are now as ‘an altar unto the Lord, and a pillar in the border of Egypt’. Jehovah in this connection also says: “And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt. ” (Isa. 19:19,20) The time of the fulfilment of this prophecy of Isaiah is in the day when God serves notice first and then expresses his vengeance against Satan’s organization. Jehovah has taken out his faithful ones, spiritual Israelites, and has made them his witnesses to declare his name in the earth. Concerning this the prophecy of Jeremiah now applies: “Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men: and hast made thee a name, as at this day; and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt, with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror.”—Jcr. 32:20^31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> It is written by Jehovah’s prophet: “He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.” (Ps. 78:49) This refers typically to the plagues in Egypt, and anti typically “evil angels” here clearly appears to refer to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the faithful remnant on earth as members of his body. This conclusion is in harmony with the Scriptures when we remember that the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">evil</span><span class="font3"> does not necessarily mean wicked, but it does mean that which brings misfortune, woe and punishment upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">wrongdoers. One translator of this text </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">renders </span><span class="font3">it thus: “A mission of messengers of misfortune.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah’s witnesses do now proclaim his message of misfortune, woe and punishment against </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s </span><span class="font3">organization, both visible and invisible. This furnishes the clue to the understanding of the antitypical fulfilment of the ten plagues upon Egypt and suggests that Jehovah uses his witnesses on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">earth </span><span class="font3">in connection therewith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> The </span><span class="font3">plagues from one to nine were pointed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">decla</span><span class="font3">rations and notices of Jehovah’s supremacy, and thereby both Jehovah’s and Satan’s organization are made to appear. The tenth plague brought the release of Jehovah’s people from Satan’s organization and their deliverance out from Egypt. Such plagues were performed before Pharaoh, and hence constitute </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">notice to </span><span class="font3">him, and the antitypical fulfilment of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">plagues </span><span class="font3">must be before Satan and his organization, and which constitute notice and warning to Satan and his organization. We know that Jehovah is not responsible for the economic depression, woes and misfortunes that have come upon the peoples of the world, because it is expressly stated in his Word that Satan has brought these woes; therefore the nine preliminary plagues </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font3">Egypt could not properly apply to such </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">woes. The </span><span class="font3">antitypical fulfilment would not be those woes mentioned in Revelation 12:12. They must </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have some </span><span class="font3">symbolic significance, such as the seven last plagues of Revelation, sixteenth chapter. Each plague is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">specific message of misfortune, and these messages delivered in modern times against Satan’s organization irk, disturb, plague and forebode the downfall </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Satan and his organization. As the plagues upon Egypt constituted notice and warning, antitypically </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fulfilled such </span><span class="font3">must be notice and warning,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE ONE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah commanded Hoses to perform </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">certain </span><span class="font3">signs in Egypt, first before the Israelites and then before Pharaoh, the purpose of which was to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">supply </span><span class="font3">convincing proof that Jehovah is God, and that Moses was sent to Egypt as God’s representative. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The third </span><span class="font3">of those signs when performed by Moses and Aaron </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font3">Pharaoh constituted the first plague </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font3">Egypt. That sign or wonder was the turning </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the water into blood. (Ps. 78: 43, 44: 105: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">29) Jehovah’s </span><span class="font3">commandment to Moses concerning the first plague is recorded at Exodus 7:14-25. Moses there appearing before Pharaoh was a type of Christ Jesus, the vindi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">cator </span><span class="font3">of Jehovah’s name. The rod which Moses </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">lifted </span><span class="font3">up represented the divine authority conferred </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by Je</span><span class="font3">hovah upon him, and antitypically represents </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">di</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vine </span><span class="font3">authority conferred by Jehovah upon Jesus, and antitypically represents the authority and power of the Lord Jesus Christ to oust the enemy and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">deliver </span><span class="font3">his people, which authority has been conferred by Jehovah. Aaron acting with Moses pictured in the antitypical fulfilment the remnant on earth performing the duties of witnesses to whom is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and Aaron using the rod shows that these witnesses are acting under divine command. God had commanded the performance of this sign and wonder before Pharaoh. “And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.” (Ex. 7: 20) The waters of the river Nile pictured the commercial part of Satan’s organization. Egypt depended upon the waters of the Nile as a means of carrying on her commerce; hence those waters to the Egyptians were a means of life and livelihood. Turning the waters into blood represented death. Satan claimed that he had made the river Nile for himself; meaning that this was his possession. (Ezek. 29:1-3) The people of the world, and many who have consecrated themselves to the Lord, have been induced heretofore to believe that commerce is vitally and essentially necessary for sustaining the life of mankind. In recent years God’s covenant people have come to learn that commerce was organized and has been carried on by Satan as a means of controlling the people and turning them away from Jehovah God. This sign or wonder was performed before the Israelites, and thus showed that God’s covenant people must first learn the meaning of commerce and that it is the institution of Satan, and then they must declare the same before the rulers and the people, that commerce constitutes an integral part of Satan’s organization which he has employed to deceive and oppress the people and to carry on his bloody and deathdealing work. The turning of the water into blood pictured or foreshadowed a message of truth being declared or made known in the presence of Satan's visible agents, as well as to the invisible part of his organization. In the type it was a notice and warning to Pharaoh. In the antitype it must be a notice and warning to the antitypical Pharaoh and his organization. The fulfilment of the prophetic picture began at the convention of God’s people at Columbus in July 1924, at which time public declaration was made that the commercial giants, who are the principal ones of the ecclesiastical systems of this world, and all of which are a part of Satan’s organization, constitute the chief rulers or representatives of Satan on earth that rule and dominate and oppress the people. A resolution was there adopted, and afterward widely published, entitled An Indictment. Its distribution extended throughout “Christendom” in many languages. The declaration was therein made and the notice hence served upon the rulers and the people that Satan’s organization is death-dealing, and that the hope of mankind is in the kingdom of God. That was notice and warning to Satan’s organization of God’s purpose to fully express his wrath against that wicked organization and that this he would do in due time. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933, page 121; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">Book One, page 122.) That notice and warning was given five years before the great economic depression began and which continues until this day. Since then Jehovah’s witnesses have continued to call the attention of the rulers and the people to the fact that Satan is the author and creator of commerce, who has exercised beastly rule over the people, and which has served as a great defamation of God’s holy name, and that it will be destroyed in vindication of Jehovah’s name. This testimony continually given by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Scriptural proof submitted in support thereof, has constituted and continues to constitute a great plague upon the organization of Satan. IIis visible representatives have no answer to these pointed truths, and hence they are tormented by hearing them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> As the waters of the river were turned into blood, bringing death, so in the past few years the people have been learning that commerce, instead of bringing them life and happiness, is a great system of oppression resulting in much suffering and death. As the peoples of Egypt dug about the river to find lifesustaining waters to drink, even so now the rulers and their allies arc bringing forth many makeshifts in their desperate attempt to pull the world out of depression and to find that which will sustain their present organization. All these schemes and plans brought forth ignore God, and the visible agents of Satan refuse to give heed to the message of God concerning his kingdom which he is causing to be brought before them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> But the magicians of Egypt cooperated in making hard the heart of Pharaoh. By their enchantments they also turned water into blood. (Ex. 7:22) The modern magicians, to wit, the clergy and religious teachers of Satan’s organization, including the “man of sin’’ class, resist the Lord and his purposes by haranguing their allies and the people and saying that the waters of truth, that is, the testimony delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, are death-dealing; and thus they turn the waters of truth into blood. Instead of receiving the testimony of Jesus Christ as a warning the clergy and their allies contend that all the trouble, woes and economic depression now upon the world proceed from Jehovah. It is the message of truth that plagues Satan’s representatives, and by refusing to give heed thereto they continue to harden their hearts against God.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> April 15, 1933.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The turning of the waters of the river Nile into blood was one of the ten plagues, end in connection with the first plague it is written: ‘ ‘ And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the river.” (Ex. 7:25) “Seven” is a divine symbolic number of completeness, and as here used it appears to say that the testimony of notice and warning to Satan’s organization must continue from that time onward until Satan’s organization yields to the rightful Ruler and Vindicator of the world or else suffers complete destruction. It would therefore follow that when the ten plagues are antitypically fulfilled and performed, then would come the complete overthrow of Satan and his organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE TWO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> Satan is totally depraved, and many of his visible agents give evidence of their total depravity. God continues to give them notice and warning. The second plague of Egypt was that of frogs. “He sent . . . frogs, which destroyed them.” (Ps. 78:45) “Their land brought forth frogs in abundance.” (Ps. 105: 30) The record of the second plague appears at Exodus 8:1-15. Jehovah commanded Moses, the type of Christ Jesus, to say unto Aaron, the type of the earthly mouthpiece of the Lord Jesus, Jehovah’s witnesses, to proceed with the work of carrying out the second plague: “And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.”—Ex. 8:5,6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The hand stretched out holding the rod, which manifestly was Moses’ rod, represented and pictured the power and authority of Jehovah God conferred upon Christ, the Greater Moses, and by him upon the earthly members of his organization, the servant class, who bear the message or testimony of Jehovah before the rulers and before the people. (Ezek. 2: 9,10; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933, page 115) The rivers and ponds and other water’s pictured the peoples of the world, particularly of “Christendom”. Frogs are “marsh leapers” and inhabit shallow waters or marshes. They give the appearance of great wisdom and importance and make a loud and discordant noise, and these particularly represent the agitators amongst the common people who suggest divers and numerous remedies for the salvation of the world; for example, the socialists, bolsheviks, communists, Christian Scientists, and the various elements of organized religion. Frogs are unclean ; and coming out of the waters of Egypt, that is, the world, shows that whatever they represent is from Satan’s organization.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 42.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> It was the exercise of divine power and authority that caused the frogs to come up and to be exposed and to harass the people; which, antitypically, is the authoritative exercise by Jehovah’s servants, including those on earth, of the power and commission in delivering the message of notice and warning to the enemy organization and which exposes the many so-called “remedies” for the human race. It appears that the second plague antitypically fulfilled had its beginning upon Satan’s organization from the year 1927 and onward and corresponds to the sixth trumpet of Revelation (9:13-21). The facts which relate to the antitypieal fulfilment of this plague are these: At Toronto, before a large visible audience and one by radio, constituting a far greater audience, a message from the Lord’s Word in the form of a resolution and supporting argument was adopted and addressed “To the Peoples of Christendom’’. The message broadcast on that occasion was afterwards printed and distributed by the millions to the peoples of earth and in many languages. Amongst other things that message said was in substance this: ‘The blessings so much desired by the people can never come through any unrighteous system of “Christendom” or any organization of so-called “Christianity”, because the same forms a part of Satan’s organization, and that there is no reason for the people to give support to that hypocritical and oppressive system that blinds them, misleads them, and turns them away from God. Further, that in this hour of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon and for ever forsake “Christendom” and all of her misleading systems and organizations, because all of these aie of the Devil's organization.’ (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 163.) At the time of the delivery of that message commerce was at its zenith in operating fraudulent and oppressive schemes to get rich, and which were oppressive to the people. About the time of the delivery of that message men and women through the public press and by other means began a great croaking noiso in the way of palaver and talk and agitation, and wind-pulling, assuming great wisdom and making much noise about the ability of their various systems to bring about the desire of the people, the falsity of which the message aforesaid exposed as being from Satan. Amongst these croakers were included the clergy and their newspapers, as well as the secular press. All of these things were the expression of human or man-made wisdom and all opposed to God’s kingdom under Christ. Included also amongst these croakers is the “man of sin” class (Jannes and Jam-bres) who join with the public press and the clergy and other agitators to speak against Jehovah's witnesses and against the message of truth delivered by them. Many who thought they were amongst God’s people were misled by these croakings and became offended at Jehovah and Christ and fell away, joining Satan’s organization openly. Some of these offended ones said in substance: “Had the radio speech at Toronto been tempered with moderation the .National Broadcasting Company would have permitted the continued use of its facilities to the Society.” None of such frog-croaking, of course, came from Jehovah’s witnesses, but came from those that opposed the kingdom; and the fact that Jehovah's witnesses called attention to and exposed these croakings as being from the Devil, and cited the Scriptures in support thereof, and showed that none of such schemes were from God, made the croakers very angry.—Jer. 23:16-21, 31, 32.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The message above mentioned exposing the frogcroaking was distributed to the official element of Satan’s visible organization as well as to the people, and Satan induced his wiseacres to try to offset it by bringing forth some frogs of their own. “And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 8: 7) These latter frog-messages did not proceed from the croakers amongst the common people, but, as the Scriptures declare, they “come out of the mouth of the dragon, . . . the beast, and . . . the false prophet”, the official element of the Devil and his organization. (Rev. 16:13,14) This latter scripture gives the clue to the meaning of the frogs of the second plague upon Egypt. In this text in the Revelation, and in connection with the Egyptian plagues, are the only places in the Bible where frogs are mentioned, and both show they represent the beastly and fraudulent claims made by Satan and his organization which the Lord by his power and authority has exposed.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, pages 42-51.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The plague of frogs docs not in any manner refer to Jehovah's witnesses or the message delivered by them, but that plague does show what resulted by reason of the delivery of the divinely given message, because the message resulted in exposing these various croakings or false claims. The dying of the frogs does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses stopped proclaiming the message of truth, because Jehovah commands them to continue their work; but it does seem to say that the reasonable people begin to see that these croakers have no real means of bringing blessings to the people and they cease giving heed to them. The official part of Satan’s organization was greatly disturbed by' the croaking noise of these antitypieal frogs, and, fearing that the same might interfere with their schemes, hence they, like Pharaoh, lied in order to have themselves released from these frog annoyances. (Ex. 8:8) The frogs of Egypt did not all die, but only those that were on the diy land and in the house of Pharaoh and his official family. All the other frogs remained in the rivers. (Ex. 8:11) The message of God’s kingdom published in 1928 specially pointed out that all attempts of government by agitation and agitators, such as hereinbefore described, must fail because only God’s kingdom under Christ can bring what is the desire of the people. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government, </span><span class="font3">pages 242-247.) That message was put in the hands of practically all the official visible part of Satan’s organization in “Christendom”. Satan and his official crowd probably have taken some satisfaction in believing that they will not be overthrown by such agitators, but that their own schemes, namely, the false, unclean messages that come from the mouth of the Devil, his beast, and his false prophet, bespeak the remedy for the controlling of humankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> The message contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3"> book, issued in 1928, further exposes the many false sys-terns and attempts of government and points out that the only possible means for the blessing of the people is through God’s kingdom. The message of truth therefore angers Satan’s organization, antitypieal Egypt, the members of which harden their hearts. Further testimony of notice and warning must continue, which will plague Satan’s organization, and which will be to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE ONLY PERFECT MAN EVER BORN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">F</span><span class="font3">OR centuries theologians have been puzzled over how Jesus eould he born of a woman who was a descendant of the sinner Adam and yet himself be “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”, as the sacred Scriptures (Ileb. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font3">:26) testify. Without a scripture in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">Bible to support their theory, these theologians invented the doctrine that Mary, the earthly mother </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Jesus, was herself </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">im</span><span class="font3">maculately conceived and bora. Such an unscri ptural argument leads only to another question, namely, How about Mary’s mother? and how about Diary’s mother’s mother? and so on all the way back to mother Eve. Such a doctrine of immaculate conception having no support whatever in the inspired Holy Scriptures as written by the apostle Peter and the other apostles and prophets, but rather being contradictory to the written Word of God, we promptly dismiss such doctrine. Paul, the apostle, says in his letter to the church at Rome, chapter five, verse twelve: “As by one man [namely, Adam] sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” Psalm fourteen, verse three, states: “There is none that doeth good, no, not one.” These scriptures being true, and since Jesus was born of a woman, was he not a sinner like others ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was not a sinner. He was born pure, holy, sinless, without spot or blemish. He was not begotten and born like other children. While he was born of the woman Mary, Joseph was not his father. Joseph was espoused to Mary, Jesus’ mother, and before they were married she was found to be with child. The record of Matthew, chapter one, verse eighteen, reads: “Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the holy [spirit].” Mary was a virgin, yet she was about to give birth and did give birth to the babe Jesus. The account goes on to say in the next few verses (20-23) : “But while [Joseph] thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the holy [spirit]. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel; which being interpreted is, God with us.<sup>-</sup>’ The holy child that was born of the virgin Mary was and is the Son of God; so the angel Gabriel assured Mary, saying to her: “The holy [spirit] shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words translated in our Bibles “Holy Ghost” should properly be translated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">holy spirit.</span><span class="font3"> The holy spirit is the invisible power and energy of Jehovah. God is holy; therefore his power and energy are holy. Father means life-giver. Jehovah is the Father of Jesus because he gave life to Jesus; hence Jesus is called the Son of God. The spirit or energy of Jehovah operating at the time of creation upon earthly substance produced earthly creatures. So the Biblical record states. (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:47) The same holy [lower and energy begat the child Jesus, who was born of his mother Mary. Therefore the life of Jesus was without sin or imperfection. The perfect, sinless germ of life of him who was born as Jesus was transferred from the spirit plane of life in heaven to the human plane or nature on earth. This, as the Scriptures state, was all accomplished by the spirit or invisible power of God the Father, and it was this perfect and holy power of God that counteracted all imperfect influences which the imperfections and blemishes and inbred sin of the virgin Mary might tend to have on the child of her virginity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was our Lord’s human name. It implied his humiliation and lowly estate, in comparison with the glory which he had with the heavenly Father before the world was. (John 17:5) He had existed long before he became a human creature. According to the Greek language, in which the gospel of John was written, his prehuman name was the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Loyos,</span><span class="font3"> which is translated in our common version Bible “the Word”. The Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Logos</span><span class="font3"> is therefore one of the titles of Jesus and should not be translated over into English at all. It means the spokesman, active agent, or messenger, of Jehovah. John, writing in the first chapter of his gospel (1-3) concerning the Logos, who later became Jesus, says: “In the beginning [which means the beginning of God's creative activity] was the [Logos], and the [Logos] was with God [that is, the God, Jehovah], and the [Logos] was God [not the God, but a god or mighty one]. The same was in the beginning with God [that is, the God, Jehovah], All things were made by him [the Logos] ; and without him [the Logos] was not any thing made that was made”; he was the active agent of Jehovah in making all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tb.e “beeinning” here referred to could not mean the beginning of God the Father, because, as Psalm forty-one, verse thirteen, and Psalm ninety, verse two, state, he is from everlasting to everlasting and never had a beginning. The work of Jehovah, however, had a beginning, and his creative work is clearly what i-, here meant in connection with the expression “in th: beginning”. The Logos was the first and only direct creation of Jehovah; and thereafter God’s creation was performed through his Logos. This is the thought expressed by the apostle Paul in Colossians, chapter one, verses fifteen to seventeen, where he said that Jesus “is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature; for by him were all thines created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As further evidence of Jesus’ prehuman existence, we have his own words as quoted from John’s gospel (6:38) : “I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” In 8:42: “I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">of myself, but he sent me.” Again (8:58): “Before Abraham was, I am.” Again (16:28): “I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.” x\nd 17:5: “Ami now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.” Again, Jesus said (Kev. 3:14): ‘I am the beginning of the creation of God.’ Furthermore, in Hebrews, chapter one, verses one and two, the apostle Paul under inspiration states: “God •. . . hath, in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.” And again, in Second Corinthians, chapter eight, verse nine, he states: “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake's he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” He was in the form of God before he became a man; as it is worded in Philippians, chapter two, verses six and seven, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglolt</span><span class="font3"> translation: “Who [that is, Jesus], though being in God's form, yet did not meditate a usurpation to be like God, but divested himself, taking a bondman’s form, having been made in the likeness of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some religious people have earnestly believed that Jesus was God himself. But such a conclusion is not warranted by the Scriptures. John said: “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.” (John 3:35) Again, Jesus said: “The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. lie that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. . . . For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:22,23,26) Again, Jesus said: “It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.” (John 8:17,18) Thus Jesus definitely fixes the fact that he and the Father are separate and distinct persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, Jesus said: “My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father s hand. I and my Father are one.” (John 10:29,30) It may be asked, Does not this prove that they are one being 1 Our answer is that it does not; but that it does show, in connection with the other scriptures just quoted, that Jesus and the Father, Jehovah, are one in harmonious action; just as Jesus subsequently prayed to the Father that the church, his followers, might be made one with him, when he said, according to John’s gospel, chapter seventeen, verses twenty to twenty-two: “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we arc one.” Thus Jesus definitely shows what is meant by being one with the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, Jesus prayed to the Father, saying: “Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.” (John 12: 27, 28) Jesus could not have been praying to himself here, but he was praying to Jehovah God, from whom he came. That the Father is greater than the Son, Christ Jesus, he shows when, according to John, chapter fourteen, verse twenty-eight, he says: “I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LL </span><span class="font3">denominational churches, both Catholic and Protestant, operate under the name “Christian”. They call themselves by the name of Christ even though they constitute a part of Satan’s organization, which is the world. Many good people desire to seme God and follow Christ and, knowing no other place to go, have been brought into these denominational folds. The clergy of each denomination respectively is the watchman of that flock and claims the flock as his. (Isa. 56:10,11) Instead of feeding the hungry souls of that flock from the Word of God the clergy furnish a provender of their own making, such as politics and business, mixed with a little of the Bible misapplied. Therefore the prophet speaks of their tables as laden with vomit. (Isa. 28:8) The consecrated followers of Jesus who are in these denominational church systems are nauseated by these mixtures of false doctrines upon which they are fed and by the hypocritical practices of those who prepare and dispense the food. They know that the doctrine of evolution is entirely contradictory to the truth concerning Christ Jesus and his great sacrifice. They know that the Lord has said that a true follower of Christ must keep himself separate from the world. They see the clergy making the profiteers and politicians the chief ones of their flock and yielding to the selfish influence of such. They see their leaders freely engaging in the evil affairs of the world. These poor sheep of the flock are sick and in distress and know’ not what to do. The clergy tell them that they may believe what they will, just so they remain in the church and help to support it. They arc told that if they leave the church they will be doing violence to their own interests and the interests of their families and the interests of the community, and that if the church falls all morality will cease. They further threaten them with the fires of eternal torment should they forsake the church system. By these various means employed the clergy hold these sick and hungry souls as “prisoners” in the denominational systems and prevent them, as far as possible, from knowing the truth concerning God’s government. These “prisoners” see that the clergy no longer worship Jehovah as their God and Christ Jesus as their Redeemer, but deny God, deny his Word and deny the blood of Christ that bought them, and instead advocate the God-dishonoring doctrine of evolution. In their distress they cry out: “Help us, 0 God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. Wherefore should the heathen [unbelievers] say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen [unbelievers] in our sight, by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that arc appointed to die.”—Ps. 79: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the Lord in his due time will bring forth these prisoners is made certain by his promise: “Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God: which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; which keepeth truth for ever; which executcth judgment for the oppressed: which givetli food </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font3"> hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners: the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous.”—Ps. 146:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the Lord indicates when he will loosen these prisoners and states that it is when he builds up Zion. That means when the Lord comes to his temple and gathers unto himself the faithful ones and covers them with the robe of righteousness. (Ps. 102:16-20; Isa. 61:10) But how will he loose these prisoners? Jehovah then addressing his servant class, the anointed ones, who are called to be his witnesses and who constitute the remnant, says: “I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Great is the privilege of those who have part in this witness work. These have the consolation of informing the spirit-begotten ones who are held as prisoners that the time has come for them to show themselves and take their stand on the side of the Lord. (Isa. 49:8,9) That witness must be given, and is being given. This explains why there is a little company of men and women who count not their lives dear unto them and who joyfully carry the message of God’s loving-kindness and concerning his righteous government to the hungry souls who are in the various church systems at this time. While Satan is employing all of his agencies to discredit God in the eyes of the people it is the privilege of the remnant to give testimony to those who will hear that Jehovah is God and that their blessings must come from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah established the jubilee system amongst the Israelites. That jubilee foreshadowed his kingdom or righteous government, when all the oppressed ones must be relieved and have a fair opportunity to start in the way of righteousness. At the opening of the jubilee year the law required the trumpet to be sounded to inform the people that the jubilee year had arrived. (Lev. 25: 9,10) Thereby the Lord foreshadowed that he would have the people informed concerning the establishment of his righteous government through which man shall be returned unto all of his possessions originally intended for him. For this reason Jesus declared that the good news of the kingdom must be given to all nations as a witness before the final sorrows should come upon Satan’s organization in which his evil organization will be overthrown. Through his prophet God said to his anointed remnant, his witnesses: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.”—Isa. 62:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A “gate”, as here used, is a symbol of an entrance into the kingdom. The remnant, being now in the temple, are therefore entering the gates of the kingdom. As God’s witnesses they are commanded to prepare the way for the people by pointing them to his righteous government. They are told to remove the stumbling stones, which are the false doctrines and theories by which the people have been blinded. They are told to lift up a standard for the people, which means to point the people to the fact that God’s righteous government is the standard to which they must rally. This is a part of the work that the Lord God is having done in the earth at this time, and only those who are unselfishly devoted to him are participating in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The only active enemies of Satan now on the earth are those who are joyfully announcing the fact that God has placed his King upon his throne. These must be obedient to God’s commands as his witnesses to do his work and finish it before the Lord dashes to pieces Satan’s organization in the final time of trouble which Christ Jesus pointed out is now impending. (Malt. 24:14,21,22) It is to be expected that Satan, that old Dragon, is exceedingly angry at the faithful witnesses of the Lord and will do everything within his power to destroy them. The Lord said that this is what he would do: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. ”-Bev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through the clergy and the principal of their flocks Satan presses his warfare against the remnant of God because of their faithfulness. But the enemy cannot prevail, for the reason, it is written: “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.”—Kev. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful remnant, trusting in the blood of Christ, anointed by the spirit of Jehovah, counting not their lives dear unto them, are joyfully giving the testimony and by the Lord’s grace they will overcome the enemy. On they go in the work with joy and singing. They press the battle to the very gate of Satan’s organization, and while so doing fear no evil, because they arc in the secret place of the Most High. (Ps. 91:1-15) Foreseeing this day of his wonderful work God through his prophet says to the remnant: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue [remnant] of his people, and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.”—Isa. 28: 5. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many Christians have deceived themselves into believing that God is trying to have them develop a beautiful and sweet character that they might go to heaven and there sing and enjoy ease and comfort forever. The true remnant class realize that in order to be of the heavenly government class they must do some singing while on earth and do it to the praise of Jehovah’s name. They must be witnesses that he is the Mighty God. They are called out of darkness into the marvelous light that they might show forth his praises while on earth. (1 Pet. 2: 9,10) God will take into his government and make official members thereof only those who prove that they love him and his King more than their own lives. Perfect love has no fear of man or Devil, but he who has perfect love and absolute confidence in the Lord boldly makes proclamation of the truth as a witness in the name of the Lord.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF UNIFYING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Chicago division, at their assembly at Chicago on Sunday, December 31, wish to express their gratitude to Jehovah for the timely and effective instructions as brought to them through the transeiiption lecture entitled “His Organization”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely the transcription machine is a marvelous blessing from Jehovah; and wo are grateful to him that not only can it </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font2">used as an instrument in guiding the people into his organization, but it can be used as an effective means of unifying Jehovah’s witnesses more thoroughly and completely in the battle for the vindication of his name with his Vindicator-King. We trust that it will be Jehovah’s will to give us further instruction in a similar manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With love and best wishes, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chicago division of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

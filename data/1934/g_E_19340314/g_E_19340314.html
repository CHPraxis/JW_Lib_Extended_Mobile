<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Sweden.—Whence the Days of the Week</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">NE cannot mention the days of the week without giving honor to some of Sweden’s ancient gods. Besides worshiping the sun on Sunday, the moon on Monday, and Saturn on Saturday, the ancient Swedes worshiped Woden on Wodensday, Woden’s wife Frigg or Friga on Friday, their son Tyr or Zeus on Tuesday, and Thor, the god of thunder, on Thursday. Apparently, when those same ancient Swedes chased our Anglo-Saxon ancestors back into the hills, the said ancestors were so impressed with the gods of these fair-haired worshipers of Woden that they never got over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sweden is a little larger than California, and of much the same shape, except that its chain of mountains is on the west instead of the east, and the seacoast, instead of being an ocean, is the Baltic sea and its great extension, the Gulf of Bothnia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there is a big difference between the climate of California and that of Sweden. The most southern part of Sweden is far north of any portion of the United States, and its upper reaches project above the Arctic circle. The Swedes are very practical. They say if you are in Sweden along the latter part of June and you wish to see the midnight sun, all you have to do is to take the train up to the northern part of the country, where you can witness the midnight sun and visit a great iron-ore mine at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Swedes, by the way, cannot persuade the Lapps to work in the mines, and so the 10,000 miners at work in far northern Gellivara are a cosmopolitan lot of people from all over the world that do not much mind the climate so long as they have steady work. They have everything in their town that any town has, and besides, once a year, they have a day several days long, when the sun merely makes a low bow to the northern horizon at midnight, but steadfastly refuses to go below it. They have a long night too, but electric lights and movies, the same as on Broadway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Plenty of Lakes and Rivers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are plenty of lakes and rivers all over Sweden. In the northern half there are about twenty rivers, rising on the Norway border and flowing some 200-odd miles through chains of lakes southeast to the Gulf of Bothnia. One of these is navigable for 70 miles. This part of the country is mostly covered with a scrub growth of stunted trees, and is rather flat and uninteresting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The heart of Sweden is in the southern half, for two hundred miles north or south of the magnificent system of lakes and canals that cut clear across the peninsula from Gottenborg to Linkoping and really make an island out of the great southern province of Gotland. Several of the country’s important cities are on the shores of the two great lakes, Wenner and Wetter, that comprise essential parts of this famous transportation system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stockholm, which lies to the north and east of the system of water transportation last named, is the eastern terminus of Lake Malar, where it empties into the Baltic sea. On this important lake, which is about seventy-five miles long, are several other of Sweden’s important cities, and on the shores of all these great lakes in the southern part of the country are fertile farm lands running back as far as the eye can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lake Malar, upon which Stockholm is located, is remarkable for the number of islands which so crowd its surface that it is hardly possible to find a square mile of open water. These islands are studded with homes of the wealthy residents of the capital. Indeed, the city itself is built on numerous islands, and is sometimes called “the northern Venice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stockholm is unique in that the harbor is right in the midst of the residence section of the city.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">355</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">When the wind is from the east it blows the smoke from the steamers directly into the palace windows. Firewood and other freight is dumped almost on the doorsteps of the aristocracy, where it lies until it is hauled away. The aristocracy do not seem to mind it, and it would not matter if they did. Swedes are practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More About the Gotha Canal</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nobody today has any leisure, but it is said that if anybody did have such he would find a trip through the Gotha canal, above mentioned, a very interesting experience. The trip takes two and one-half days. It requires seven hours to cross Lake Wenner, and for at least two hours the steamer is out of sight of land. There are 74 locks, of solid granite, which lift the steamer a total of 167 feet. In places the route is through virgin forests of silver birches whose boughs overhang the banks. The landscape throughout is the loveliest in Sweden. By rail the same journey takes less than 12 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About the middle of the journey Lake Wetter is crossed. The height of the surface of this lake above the Baltic is 300 feet, but its depth is 400 feet, and in one place no bottom has ever been found. The behavior of this body of water is most singular. It has periodic rises and falls independent of the wetness or dryness of the season, and is subject, even in the calmest weather, to violent underground swells, emitting terrific sounds when covered with ice. The claim is made, but denied, that this lake is directly connected with a lake, the Boden See, in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A further extraordinary feature of Lake Wetter is the mirages, frequently visible to many people and for hours at a time. These include marching armies of cavalry, infantry and artillery with banners and glittering weapons; palaces, castles and ships have been seen to rise from the water and remain in view for hours; caravans of camels have crossed from shore to shore in full view of multitudes. We judge that natural conditions are favorable to mirages and that perhaps the demons have a hand in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gefle the Prettiest Town</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gefle, 100 miles north of Stockholm, is said to be the prettiest town in Sweden. In 1869 this town was visited by a great fire which obliterat</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font7">the greater part of it. The residents of the burned area met together and agreed to pool their interests and rebuild a replanned city. Accordingly, every other street has a line of shade trees and a promenade in the center, with driveways on either side. At intervals are parks, parade grounds and open squares. It makes one feel that the best thing that could happen to some of our American cities would be a big fire that would compel the adoption of similar measures. Dannemora, near Gefle, is famous for its high-grade ore. There are places on the coast of Sweden where forty or fifty tide marks may be counted one above the other, upon the rocks. These tide marks show that the water was once higher by seventy feet. The shores are indented by cliffs which formerly inclosed bays and beaches that are now thirty, forty or fifty feet above the level of the sea. These tide marks are particularly noticeable on the island of Gotland, which is slowly being pushed up from the sea. Gotland, by the way, is 75 miles long, and important enough to have its own railway system and a branch line besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is an interesting fact that the north parts of Sweden are rising more rapidly than the south parts. The evident explanation is that the ice cap was heavier in the north, heavy enough at one time to cause subsidence of the earth’s crust, but as the ice deposited in Noah’s day gradually melted the earth returned to its former position, or level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Comparisons with California</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is much waste land in California, but there is much more waste land in Sweden. Several items of interest are presented:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California Sweden</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acres in farm lands &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30,442,581 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9,193,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Number of farms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135,676 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;430,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gross farm income, 1930 $586,538,000 $258,108,000</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark31"><span class="font6">Average acreage per farm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;224</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark32"><span class="font6">Average farm income &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4,323</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark33"><span class="font6">Average income per acre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$19</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">A little consideration of these figures shows why America has many thousands of citizens of sterling worth that were born in Sweden, and why Sweden has almost no citizens that were born in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It never gets cold enough to freeze in California, though under certain conditions there is a penetration to the chilliness that one feels more than freezing weather. In Stockholm they get the real thing; in January it goes to 26 below zero and in July may rise to as much as 97°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the forest lands, 23,547,375 acres, about 45 percent are owned by farmers, 4 percent by large landed proprietors, 27 percent by companies having sawmills or pulp mills, and 24 percent by the state. In forestry, lumbering, sawmills and pulp mills 100,000 men are regularly employed, and 400,000 more obtain some part of their living therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The iron mines at Dannemora already mentioned, have been operated continuously for 300 years and produce the iron from which the very best tool steel is made. The mine, which is over 600 feet deep, extends beneath a lake of the same name. The miners never know, when they touch off a blast, whether or not the whole lake will be in upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three-fourths of all the mechanical energy produced in Sweden is hydroelectric. About 45 percent of the farms are equipped with electricity. Some of the Danish cities are lighted and their street cars operated by current supplied from Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Swedes love their country, hate to leave it, and love to return to it. In the year 1929, after 250 years of exile in southern Russia, several hundred Swedes returned to their homeland at one time. They had managed to preserve their language, and many of their customs, but were reabsorbed with difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Law-abiding Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the beautiful and charming American city of Jacksonville, in a recent calendar year, there were three times as many people killed as in the whole of Sweden, which has sixty times the population. That is 180 to 1. The same year New York city had 387 murders, while in the whole of Sweden, which has the same population, the total of homicides was 20; that is 19 to 1, and plenty bad enough. In Stockholm, with 474,000 inhabitants, in the year 1929, the total number of homicides was 3; one of the slayers was under the influence of liquor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five percent profit is the amount which the liquor monopolies of Sweden may receive. There are 121 liquor control districts, ■with a separate company to each district; each must buy its supplies from the one wholesale house. All concessions are granted by the county authorities. Stock in the liquor control companies may not be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each reputable citizen may purchase one gallon per month, but must pass an examination to prove that he is financially and socially responsible. In restaurants liquor may be had only with hot foods, and not at all after midnight. People below par are limited as to the amount of liquor they may purchase; those wholly irresponsible may not have it at all. Police keep the liquor control companies posted as to who are responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In all Sweden there are but 201 retail liquor stores; 2,200 districts are dry. Bootlegging is unknown; there is no enforcement problem; since 1912 the consumption of liquor has decreased 50 percent. The total prison population is but 2,000; many jails house but two or three inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Peace-loving Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a curious fact of history that Alfred Nobel, discoverer of dynamite, explosive gelatines and ballistite, •who made his millions in the manufacture of ordnance and nitroglycerin, is chiefly perpetuating his name by the Nobel peace prizes, awarded, among others, to Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root, Woodrow Wilson, Fridtjof Nansen, Aristide Briand, Gustave Streseman, Austen Chamberlain, and Charles G. Dawes. The prizes are of $50,000 each, and awarded annually, not only for peace, but for the greatest discoveries in physics, chemistry, medicine and literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though Sweden once dominated all northern Europe, and had huge possessions in Russia, Denmark, Poland and Prussia, yet the Swedes as a people are peaceable and peace-loving. There is universal military service, with about 600,000 men on the army roll. The navy is maintained merely for coast defense, but has 4,000 officers and men stationed on its 80-odd vessels. Sweden is more proud of its old folks’ homes than of its navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In every community there is a director of public relief, aided by a committee of representative citizens whose business it is to inquire into the needs of the unemployed and the poor. Hospital care for such is provided free of charge. There are also child welfare committees in every community, and committees to distribute funds to widowed and abandoned mothers. Old age and invalidity insurance is obligatory for every person between 16 and 66 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Divorces are granted by mutual consent and may be secured by either party after a separation of three years. Woman suffrage was granted in 1909, and more women vote than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sweden was the first country to recognize the equality of sons and daughters in the inheritance of property. The country is world-famous for its cleanliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The First io Recognize America</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On April 3,1783, five months to the day before the peace treaty was signed between Great Britain and the United States, the king of Sweden, Gustav III, was the first of all monarchs and of all governments to recognize the United States as an independent nation. The two countries have always felt a special interest in each other from that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Swedes are said to be the proudest people in Europe. One reason for this is that Sweden has always been Sweden, and it is the only nation in Europe that has never been invaded or conquered or had its boundaries changed by foreign powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people are too conservative to take kindly to Bolshevism. Fifty thousand people paraded in Stockholm in a demonstration against Socialism, and some have taken it from this that Fascism would be acceptable to many. The country was strongly socialistic some years ago, but has swung away from Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The public debt is only $500,000,000, most of which is held at home. The king must be a Lutheran; he has the absolute power of veto. All public officials, including school teachers, must be Lutherans, and, by law, the Lutheran religion is taught in all schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The country is divided into six bishoprics, 83 deaneries and 482 parishes. The parishes are grouped into 24 provinces, each with its own government, responsible to the national government, the Rigsdag, one of the oldest of parliamentary bodies. The clergy are theoretically all appointed by the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nobles have no legal privileges, but only social advantages. They meet once a year to consider subjects pertaining to their welfare. The “house of knights” in which they meet is considered the finest specimen of old Stockholm architecture. A noble may run for office, the same as anybody else, but being a noble may prevent him from getting the office, as the people do not take much stock in titled aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1811 the Swedish parliament designated one of Napoleon’s field marshals, General Bernadotte, the son of a French lawyer, as crown prince, and his descendants are still on the throne. Napoleon advised him not to take the job, but he did, and, in the final coalition, was on the opposite side. The royal palace at Stockholm, 348 by 372 feet in size, is the largest building in Sweden, and the most imposing. Street traffic, the music from a neighboring cafe, and the smoke from a dozen steamers, with the confusion of loading and unloading cargoes, make it an unlovely place to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The princes are all millionaires, interested in science, sports and art; they are not permitted to occupy governmental positions. One of the princes married a commoner; the princess Astrid married the crown prince of Belgium. Everybody in the king business in Europe is related to everybody else in the same industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Ancient History</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first historic mention of Sweden is by the great Roman historian Tacitus, toward the end of the first century A.D. He mentions the Suiones, living in the midst of the Baltic, as powerful both in warriors and in ships. The bows and sterns of their ships were constructed alike, and therefore equally well suited for landing. The boats did not carry sails; the oars were not fastened in a row along the sides, but left free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The northern part of Sweden was peopled by the Svea, or Swedes; the southern part by the Gota, or Goths, the latter an offshoot of the former. These people, consolidated into one, were migratory, restless, courageous and indomitable. For hundreds of years the tribes were at war with one another, but Upsala, where the heathen gods were worshiped, gradually came to be the acknowledged center. There the heathen priests offered human as well as animal sacrifices. Priests are like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the sacred acts was to throw a poor man into a sacred well in the precincts of the temple. When the priests could not recover his dead body, it was taken as a token that the wishes of the people would be fulfilled. The poor people had not yet caught the brilliant thought that, if they really wanted peace and happiness, what was needed was that somebody should throw all the priests into the well and then put a cover on the well. Upsala is the present seat of Swedish learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Goths, under the name Goutoi, are mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy in A.D. 150. Southern Sweden is still called Gotland ; it was once called Scania, hence the name Scandinavia. The Greek historian Procopius mentions the Heruli, who inhabited Hungary in the sixth century, as sending messengers to the Heruli of Scandinavia, requesting that a member of the old dynasty might come and rule over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Goths Always Enterprising</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several Arabian geographers give interesting information about the Scandinavian merchants, who sold furs as well as slaves. They are described as tall and invariably armed with axe, knife and sword; they adorned themselves with chains of gold and silver; they prayed to wooden images.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Forty thousand oriental coins of this period were found in Swedish soil. The word Russ was used by Arabs and Slavs to describe the Swedes who were the first rulers of Russia. The Goths (Swedes) overran Russia, Poland, Ukrainia, Bulgaria, and menaced and finally destroyed the Roman Empire. The most important geographical names in Russia are Swedish names. A Greek writer of the tenth century uses Scandinavian names for the rapids of the Dnieper river. The Gothic historian Jordanes, living in the sixth century, speaks of Skadza (Scandinavia) as “bosom of peoples”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both as warriors and as merchants the Swedes, or Russ, as they were also called, made their way from the Baltic to the Black sea. One of their chiefs, Rurik by name, in 859 was chosen by certain wild tribes of the country now called Russia to be their first prince. His capital was Novgorod, thence shifted to Kief, and finally to Moscow, where at length his successor became the czar of all the Russias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In those days, when the Swedes (Vikings, Northmen, Goths) made their way into every European land, bands of them entered the service of the eastern emperor at Constantinople, where they received the name Varangians, from the oath by which they were bound. They are frequently referred to in literature imder that name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rome Obscures the Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is manifest that the people who knew how to write (the Romans) did not give the Varangians or Goths or Swedes the attention they should have had. Visby, on the island of Gotland, was for centuries the wealthiest city of its size in the world; it had 13,000 merchants, divided into sixteen guilds. The elaborate rules of trade formulated by these guilds are the basis of the present admiralty laws of Great Britain, and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lawsuits were strictly formal. If the evidence was obscure, one of the parties had to prove his case by oath. This oath was corroborated by a certain number of “trusted men”. Out of this curious institution a jury was developed, whose business it was to acquit or condemn the accused. It was the business of the lagman (lawman, lawyer) to recite from memory the law of the province which applied to the case in hand. Result, our modern courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Viking lords brought back from their raiding and trading trips the wealth of the world. When they died they were buried in magnificent armor, together with their boats, weapons, household goods, dogs and horses, fully equipped, so it was supposed, to continue their earthly life of warfare and adventure in the kingdom of the dead. Actually, of course, they are merely dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In due time the Swedes became “Christians”. At the dawn of the Reformation the Catholic king, Christian II, gathered 82 of the most prominent men of Sweden for a conference and put them to the sword. Thereupon Gustavus Eriksson Vasa, son of one of the magistrates that had been put to death, organized the movement that drove the king back to Denmark and placed Sweden definitely on the Protestant side, and it is there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vasa was clever enough to discern that the Roman Catholic system is the greatest of all possible enemies of the common people; he lined the whole of Sweden up against the papacy, and his grandson Gustavus Adolphus, the victor in the Thirty Years’ War, nearly destroyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The latter, with an army of 13,000 handpicked Swedes, crossed the Baltic sea and overcame the combined forces of the Catholic kings until he was master from the Alps to the polar sea. No man, before or since, wielded greater power in Europe, and he was at the height of his fame and influence when he was killed in battle. His army went out in the morning singing a hymn he had composed, and returned in confusion at evening bringing his lifeless body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Queen Christina and Ivar Kreuger</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He had a fool for a daughter. Educated and trained to take her father’s place, she surrounded herself with the worst of rascals, eventuating in her public profession of conversion to the Roman Catholic faith and abdication of her throne in favor of her cousin. After relinquishing the throne of a Protestant country she tried in vain to get herself made sovereign of the Roman Catholic countries of Poland and Naples. But Christina is not the only Swede that ever made a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How about Ivar Kreuger? There is the boy who got our greatest (?) and wisest (?) American bankers to sell the American public $250,000,000 worth of blue sky that had nothing more substantial under it than hot air. Our internationally famous robbers of widows and orphans let this man have anything he wanted, and were so polite about it that they never bothered to ask him if he had any assets. All they did was fork the money over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kreuger was clever enough to loan $75,000,000 of the above to the French government. Kreuger left personal debts of $93,500,000 and direct liabilities of $74,800,000. He was a clever juggler of books and a good paymaster of bribes to the Swedish premier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Match Industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everybody knows that Swedish matches are the best in the world. The first phosphorus matches were manufactured at Jonkoping, Sweden, in 1843, and it is today the match center of creation. A single machine in the factory there puts up 40,000 boxes in a day of 11 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kreuger’s trustification of the match business nearly wrecked Sweden financially. Sweden is not a rich country, and it was impossible for her to safely embark on the career into which his financial operations plunged her. The government was compelled to grant moratoria on private debts, close the stock exchange, and take heroic efforts to keep the most important banks in the country from going to the wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Swedish engineers are famous the world over. John Ericsson, inventor of the screw propeller, and of the ironclad battleship, was employed as a surveyor on engineering works when he was seven years of age, and at twelve was in charge of the work of six hundred men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Electrification of the railway lines of the country has proceeded apace, financed in America. With her water powers fully developed (set at 5,000,000 horsepower) Sweden could become a great industrial country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting Swedish invention enables the seasoning of wood artificially in two days. A log is placed in a cylinder, a centrifugal pump creates a vacuum and out comes the sap from the entire log, including the heart. In 48 hours the lumber is ready for use; the cost is only about one dollar per thousand board feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Somebody figured it out that the annual yield of Swedish forests would make a hoop around the world one inch thick and one hundred and forty-four feet wide. To handle this lumber and take care of its extensive iron-mining industry, Sweden has more miles of trackage in proportion to its population than any other European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only are the Swedes famous as engineers, but they literally take to the water like ducks. Every Swede is a swimmer and a sailor. There are 1100 lakes in the country; so there is plenty of chance to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some More Industrial Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sweden has admittedly the best servants in the world; children are trained to the duties of the kitchen and general housekeeping as thoroughly as in the schools they are trained in other matters of education. Formerly the relations between master and servant w<sup>T</sup>ere close and confidential. In our evil times this is breaking down, and within the past few years Sweden had one labor riot where troops were called out and shot and killed four men and one woman. The Ford Company has a plant at Stockholm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The General Export Association maintains commercial stipendiaries in all lands that obtain merchants, agents and buyers for Swedish goods and put foreign business houses in communication with Swedish exporters. It has a great fund of information available to all inquirers who pay the actual expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1929 it arranged for large shipments of Canadian silver and black foxes and of American skunks and muskrats into Sweden, for breeding purposes. The Swedes intend to make the best use of their cut-over lands. Wolf and bear are still found in Swedish forests and often commit great ravages. Elk and deer are also found. Lemmings in immense numbers often lay waste large areas. There are 34,000 persons engaged in fisheries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Swedes have been called the proudest people in Europe except the Spaniards. The children are taught to say yes and no and to mean it. Some give no titles to anybody, not even the king, while others give titles to everybody, invariably giving their occupation every time they are mentioned. This creates a curious situation where people are constantly referred to as “Thora-daughter-of-Upholsterer Anderson”, or “Son-of-Organist Nilsson”, or “Mr. -the-Wholesaledealer Smith”. A doctor’s wife is always a doctoress, and a colonel’s wife is a coloneless. Every man is an uncle, and every woman an aunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About half the proper names in Sweden end in “son”, and half the space in city directories is monopolized by the families of Oleson, Larson, Anderson, Johnson, and Peterson. There are no colors in the nomenclature—no Whites, Greens, Blacks, Browns or Grays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Desire for Excellence</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Swedes have a desire for excellence in everything, including athletics. Diplomas and degrees are awarded for superior swimming. Everybody can skate as well as swim. The nation’s winter sport is skiing, skimming over the country on snowshoes. A skillful skier can make a mile in two minutes, and the jumping record is 70 feet. In 1930 a swimmer jumped 115 feet from a bridge in Stockholm and was uninjured. Ice-yachting and sailing are popular sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Music? Answer—Jenny Lind. At nine, admitted to the Stockholm Conservatory of Music; at eighteen, made her debut with great success; at twenty-four, acknowledged the leading singer of Europe; at twenty-seven, carried England by storm; at thirty, sang in Auburn, New York. A man who was there (and, to get the chance to hear her, paid $1 to stand on a ladder outside of the opera house window) said that when the Swedish Nightingale sang the old Negro melody “Old Black Joe” her voice was so inexpressibly sweet and tender that every person in the audience wept, including himself. Music is taught in all Swedish schools, and every town has its singing society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Spain every other person is illiterate— the Roman Catholic ideal. In Sweden only one person in five hundred is illiterate—the opposite ideal. Women in Sweden have every right that men have. Children are taught to save; the government opens an account with each child and puts two crowns to its credit to start it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Museums have been constructed on the most elaborate scale. These museums show several complete farmhouses, with every feature of Swedish country life just as it exists in various sections, and families living in the houses just as they did before they were moved to their present locations. The scientific museums of Sweden contain more than a half million treasures of antiquity, and are said to be the richest prehistoric relics in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Lutheran Religious System</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By somewhat the same methods as link sausage is made, “religion” is made a part of the education of every Swedish child. When the child reaches 16 the young girl wears her first long dress, and the boy his first black suit; there is an examination in the catechism by the pastor and the elders of the church, and the following Sunday, no matter what interest they have in the Lord, in the Scriptures, or in anything else, they take their first communion and are “confirmed”. As a result of this entirely unscrip-tural plan of procedure, Lutherans are about the hardest people in the world to have listen to a message from the Lord’s Word; they know it all—learned it by machinery when they were young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was formerly against the law for Roman Catholics to enter Sweden, but now they have 3,424 communicants, and are growing rapidly in numbers among the aristocracy. The king, a Bernadotte, is of Jewish ancestry. Formerly everybody went to church on Sunday morning; now<sup>T</sup> Sunday is becoming, as in America, a day of excitement and amusement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his own country Swedenborg is held in appreciative memory, not for his religious views, which few accept, but for his works on iron, copper, geology and algebra, which are standard. Linnaeus, one of the greatest of botanists, was a Swede; so also was the famous chemist Scheele, who discovered oxygen. Baron Norden-skjold, the first to accomplish the Northeast Passage, though born in Finland, was a Swede, and all his explorations were on behalf of the Swedish government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ever Hear of Swedish Massage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friction, kneading, rolling and percussion of the external tissues of the body was mentioned by Homer and Hippocrates and long ago practiced by the Japanese, Chinese, Turks, and Egyptians. The value of these operations depends upon the skill of the operator, which in Sweden has been brought to its highest level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Sweden doctors more often recommend massage than medicine. They do not send bills to their patients, but depend upon their generosity. They receive an annual fee, with something extra In case of serious illness in the family. Electrical treatments of various sorts are much in vogue. Sick clubs are popular in all the Scandinavian countries; they should be a feature of every country. In Sweden the national government contributes 15 percent and the communes 25 percent of the clubs’ funds; when a member falls ill he collects 83c per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of attention to their bodies the Swedes are rapidly growing taller and stronger. Between 1841 and 1928 the average height of 21-year-old recruits increased from 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 8 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are comparatively few poor. At the “people’s kitchen” in the wintertime a man may get a substantial dinner here for 9c, and a breakfast or supper for 4c. It is not intended as a charity, and nothing is given away. At some hotels a man and his wife are charged as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">iy<sub>2 </sub></span><span class="font7">persons if they occupy the same room. There is high respect for motherhood, both married and unmarried. It is regarded as a special service to the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only thing we have to say against the Swedes is that they are the greatest coffeedrinkers in the world, averaging 600 cups apiece annually. And that is not a very serious charge, now, is it?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Radio Petition Attacked</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">HALL the American people hear the truth, or shall clergymen, who want to shield themselves, prevent the truth from being told? The responsibility is upon Congress to say whether or not an organization can browbeat and threaten any citizen into doing anything in the United States. Almost two and one-half million Americans have recently voiced themselves as being against such browbeating and threatening methods by signing the Protest and Petition circulated by Jehovah’s witnesses, for freedom of speech on the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fearing the consequences of this tremendous popular expression, the Catholic press is throwing sand in the eyes of the people by howling “Fraud!” in the obtaining of the signatures to the Petition. Using the Catholic press as its instrument of inquisition, the Hierarchy is making an investigation the results of which can be colored to meet the urgent need of the moment; for “statistics”, properly selected and presented, can be made to ‘prove’ almost anything. But it is most difficult to explain away 2,416,141 signatures to a petition of national significance. It is important, vitally important, to the continued power of the Catholic hierarchy that Catholics, or those who can still be induced to read the Catholic papers, shall not realize what it is all about. So the petition for freedom of speech over the radio is persistently misrepresented as of no consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Petition Indicates Public Attitude</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact remains that the petition, circulated by men and women in all walks of life, furnishes a remarkable cross-section of public opinion, not only with regard to free speech in general, but also in respect to interference with Judge Rutherford’s broadcasts in particular. Similarly, polls taken by leading periodicals have proved effective previews of public action in political and other campaigns. The petition may be misrepresented by the Hierarchy, and it may even be ignored by certain unfaithful representatives of the people, but it will have its effect nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But how useless, how utterly useless, to try to misrepresent a man whose works are as well known as Judge Rutherford’s, or to try to besmirch a class of people who are known and read of all men, whose works testify to their integrity. All these misrepresentations, together with defamations and outright lies, must inevitably react upon those who send them forth; because not what is said, but the truth or falsity of what is said, will tell in the ultimate reckoning. When the Catholic hierarchy (and we say this with sincere sympathy and regard for honest Catholics) is governed by its age-old maxim, “The end justifies the means,” it is not strange that it imputes the same course to others. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, are prohibited from following any such rule. With them the means must conform to the end to be gained; nor could they by any stretch of the imagination follow the course of those who say “Let us do evil, that good may come”, which course Paul so specifically denounced. (Romans 3:8) To Jehovah’s witnesses the two things are incompatible; for no good can result from wickedness, nor is any one of them permitted, by the Word of Almighty God, Jehovah, ever to inflict evil or use coercion. The claim that they misrepresented their mission is therefore incredible. Their instructions were clear and to the point. In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">No. 374 the method followed in presenting the petition to the people was clearly set forth to offset a malicious statement by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> Cleveland, Ohio, of December 15, 1933, to the effect that Jehovah’s witnesses had misrepresented the petition. But the falsity of the charge is so evident that no statement in contradiction could make it more palpable. Every one of the sheets upon which the signatures were to be placed had at the head a full, clear statement of what it was for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Inquisition in the U. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note how desperately, how recklessly, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bzdletin,</span><span class="font7"> issue of February 23, 1934, seeks to make out a case. It says, “Signed statements in the possession of this paper in cases of seven persons are unanimous in declaration that the Rutherford solicitor approached these persons, mostly Catholics, with a plea for continuance of Father Coughlin’s radio sermons, saying that by so signing efforts to ban the Sunday afternoon discourses would be squelched.” Seven persons, approached by the inquisitor, were persuaded to give the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> a signed statement. (That leaves 2,416,134 signatures still to be accounted for.) It would be interesting to know how these seven were persuaded to sign this statement which states that they did not know what they were signing previously, though the wording of the petition was before them in plain type. It may also be queried whether they knew what they were signing the second time (for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin),</span><span class="font7"> or under what conditions they signed their “recantation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But suppose a few Catholics did sign the Petition to Congress under a misapprehension. Does that give the Catholics any right to threaten and coerce radio stations to break their written contract to broadcast the speeches of Judge Rutherford or to refuse to renew such contract ? Does it justify the Catholics in having actually used such threats and coercion ? Or does it give the big radio corporations of America any right to discriminate unjustly in favor of one broadcaster and against another! Judge Rutherford has not attacked any individual, but is only setting out the Bible doctrines or truths and thus merely following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ in declaring the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In its desperate attempt to discredit the petition and its sponsors the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> stoops to such inanities as saying that many people signed the petition being circulated by Jehovah’s -witnesses “to get rid of them”, not knowing what they were signing! Let it even be granted that some who signed the petition </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mag</span><span class="font7"> have done so without appreciating fully its significance, it is utterly absurd to claim that ‘they signed because the circulators of the petition represented themselves as trying to keep Mr. Coughlin on the air’. As a matter of fact, however, Jehovah’s witnesses would not move a finger to get Mr. Coughlin off the air. They realize and appreciate the fact that liberty of speech over the air will likewise mean a continuance of Mr. Coughlin’s talks, regardless of their estimate of that radio speaker’s efforts. They are willing to give to others the same liberties they ask for themselves, and, no doubt, in circulating the petition they so stated when the name of Mr. Coughlin was brought up by the person called on. The petition first of all calls for liberty of speech over the air, and secondly expresses disapproval of a notorious effort to interfere with such liberty. No one who signed the petition blanks can truthfully say that he did not understand what he was signing because Jehovah’s witnesses made no effort to help him understand. The congressmen who received the petition can testify that every sheet was headed by the full wording of the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do Congressmen Cater to Hierarchy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But how does it come that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> and other Catholic papers run by priests are in possession of signatures to a petition presented to representatives of the people at Washington? This petition was submitted to congressmen for presentation to the proper authorities at Washington, and not to the Catholic hierarchy. Further, if certain congressmen thought it well to check up on the matter, why was the work of inquisition entrusted to a highly prejudiced agency, one of the very groups against which the protest was made? It is an unheard-of situation in the ‘land of the free”. The Constitution prohibits the union of church and state. It smacks of the Dark Ages, of Mexico and of Spain. Is it to be the policy of the representatives of independent Americans to turn over to the Catholic hierarchy information of ■whatever sort may come into their hands? Shall the people protest to Congress and have their representatives turn their protests over to highly prejudiced agencies? Shall they be subjected to inquisition by those who have no interest in America other than to make it a duplicate of Spain and Mexico and other benighted and oppressed countries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another characteristic observation by the aforementioned paper, and similar statements by other Catholic papers, belittles the petition because it contains signatures of colored citizens. Most assuredly it does; and why not? Are not Negroes people, and citizens ? Are they not a part of the population? Do they not have equal rights with other Americans? The petition was circulated among all classes, rich and poor, great and small, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and the large number of unchurched and unfettered individuals not represented in any religious organization. The petition is therefore most emphatically representative. It seems that the Catholic press in America still retains the viewpoint that the average man and woman, the lowly and the working classes, are not to be taken into consideration, and that any petition signed by them is of no consequence. This is evidently the Catholic hierarchy’s traditional attitude toward the people generally. Witness such countries as Spain, Mexico and Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does the Catholic press want us to believe that the many Catholics who signed the petition were so ignorant and so lacking in common sense as to sign under complete misapprehension a clearly printed petition, or worse still, to sign something the purpose of which (according to this false claim) was artfully concealed from them? We believe that Catholics are more intelligent than that, and that the Catholic press was moved to its attack upon the petition for precisely the reason that so many Catholics, resenting the un-American actions of the Hierarchy, wished to put themselves on record as being in harmony with the constitutional provisions for free speech, and which includes free radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let Congress Safeguard Rights</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is of highest importance to the American Congress to safeguard the rights of the people to worship God without hindrance. If the Catholics concede that Jehovah’s witnesses have a right to broadcast their views, then they have no right to use coercive means to prevent it. Therefore everyone should be in favor of the Bill to amend the Radio Act of 1927, to prevent any further discrimination and coercion of this sort.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Practically every form of gainful employment known to the human race is represented in the ranks of Pennsylvania workers. There are men skilled in science, and there are track laborers. There are surgeons and ditch diggers; sea captains and blacksmiths; artists and freight handlers; architects and carpenters; lawyers and porters, and civil engineers and cooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pennsylvania Railroad’s great fleet of trains requires the services of the largest group of employees on the railroad. The men who man the Broadway and The American, together with the Pennsylvania’s other passenger and freight trains, including enginemen, conductors, firemen, brakemen, flagmen and baggagemen, number more than 32,000. Clerical workers number 16,400, and track and roadway employees, 13,000. The smallest group is composed of teamsters and stablemen. Only three men are left to take care of old Dobbin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Contrary to popular opinion, women play a prominent part in the operation of the modern railroad. There are several thousand of them employed on the Pennsylvania, and they are not all clerical workers and telephone operators.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom the Hope of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THE following paragraphs from Henry Knight Miller’s work </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life Triumphant</span><span class="font7"> reveals anew the discernment of thoughtful men that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world. Mr. Miller was formerly a clergyman; he is now an editor. We would say this is a great reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the laudable effort to meet these needs (food, fellowship and culture) three principal means have been tried—education, invention and religion. But education has been too abstract and far removed from actual life. It consists too largely of the profitless accumulation of facts, figures and dates, while too little attention is given to the inculcation of mighty, transforming idealism and practical programs for the triumphant organization of personal and social life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Invention has made mighty contributions in laborsaving devices, intended to free man from economic drudgery and produce bread and beauty in abundance for all. Yet the masses still live but little removed from want, so close to the poverty line that the sickness or death of the principal bread-winner renders severe indeed the struggle for existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even religion has not answered the need, not because the potentialities are lacking. . . . But the soul of religion has ever been crushed under the godless heel of cold, grasping and heartless ecclesiastical organization. Religion given up to externals, competing for property, membership and power, has become an empty fetish, devoid of redemptive force, a parasite upon the social structure. It has fostered hate instead of brotherhood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">AYS John A. Simpson, president of the National Farmers Union: “All war is for profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During a war the manufacturers make the profit. After a war those who hold the obligations of the Government and of the people make the profit. Let me give you an illustration. In the last war the manufacturers of this country in making contracts with Uncle Sam wrote into the contracts three provisions. First, that Uncle Sam must take the goods contracted for even though the war ended the next day. Second, Uncle Sam must ship those goods to France. Third, Uncle Sam must not bring them back to this country. Under this contract this government was shipping goods to France a year after the war had ended. When the war did end the government found itself with $4,000,000,000 worth of property in France. Under the contract our government could not bring this property back. They sold it to France at 10 cents on the dollar, or for a sum of $400,000,000. However, France has never paid the bill and we have now granted her a moratorium. Let me give you an illustration of how the manufacturers operated. The International Harvester Co., under this contract, sold and the Government shipped to France every kind of farm implement made by them. There was shipped to France of International Harvester make, corn planters, cultivators, grain drills, drag harrows, disc harrows, and if it were not such a tragedy it would be a real comedy, the International Harvester Co. sold to the United States and shipped to France, to be used in whipping the kaiser, thousands of International Harvester Co. manure spreaders.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In the secrecy of the confessional twenty-five thousand priests can obtain that information from millions of men and women in every station of public and private life. Virtual monopoly of strategical police and secret service positions opens another avenue to personal, domestic and political secrets hidden from the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So completely does the hierarchy control the daily and magazine press that scarcely a paper in the United States dares exploit any news or editorial matter distasteful to the papal authorities. The censorship is applied with equal rigor to the great national and international newsgathering syndicates. Nor do the other chief opinion-forming instrumentalities dare brook the wrath of the papal thrones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No patriotic periodical of limited circulation can match weapons so powerful and far-reaching. The artillery range is too unequal. The hierarchy does not answer the disclosures of such periodicals. They cannot be answered. It is easier to ignore them. While they reach and enlighten a few score thousand people, the controlled press reaches a hundred million.</span></p>

And three more cuts of the same size, and the whole world would wake up and find they were real Christians. How exciting that would be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then they politely recommend the abolition of poison gas, and every polite militarist on earth will be glad to explain that the only reason why he is making it is that everybody else is making it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And they want America to cut down the war debts, but those naughty Europeans, they will just understand, won’t they? and they must promise, too, that the money they borrowed, but which they are now not to pay, must not be used for increased armaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nations will be glad to have reduced the debts they never intend to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then they want abolition of compulsory military training in colleges and high schools, and the old men who endow colleges and who start all our wars will see the dominies all in Hades first. And that’s all for now.</span></p>

Byrd, chairman of the National Economy League, was awarded approximately $4,200 a year by Act of Congress as a ‘reward’ for his polar explorations. If Admiral Byrd (age 44) lives the allotted span of seventy years, he is still due to receive $109,200 as an outright gift from the taxpayers of the United States—a large proportion of whom are veterans. Today Admiral Byrd is lending his energy and his name to a movement that would take away from a disabled veteran the monthly sum of $12—the amount he receives for a 25 percent disability —or $144 a year. Should this veteran by some miracle defeat the mortality rate among disabled veterans and survive another thirty years until he reaches the age of seventy, he will have received a total of $4,320.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Here is the picture. One gets $109,200 for taking a trip to the barren ice wastes of the south pole, while the other gets $4,320 for risking his life on the battlefield in time of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Others whose names are linked with the leadership of the National Economy League are also beneficiaries of gratuities paid from public funds in the form of pensions, retired pay, annuities, etc. For example, General John J.

The Louisville Title Company has offered to settle our $62,000.00 debt for $30,000.00 if we will act now, and unless we do they are going to foreclose. What does it mean ? It means that we will lose our church building. It means that 90 families that have signed the note will lose their homes. It means that it will be a calamity that not only the church but the entire City of Corbin will never be able to overcome. Are you willing to see this happen? Of course not. Then—when the folks come to you this week for a pledge to save the situation, will you make the largest pledge you can? We can borrow the money if we raise $800.00 per month. We can, we must. Do not fail the church in this crucial hour. The Church, the Town, the Lord, is waiting to see. What will your answer be?</span></p>

And I say to you, if you see a wounded German, shove him out and have no nonsense about it. . . . Kill them, every mother’s son of them. Remember that your job is to kill them—that is the only way—exterminate the vile creatures. . . . When a German says ‘Kamarad’, you know that he wants to be put out of his agony.

The fear of judgment is depicted in the faces of the crowd in a huge painting; and the priests are depicted receiving heavy bribes to save the people from the flames. Indeed, after seeing so many miserable little villages of logs, mud and straw, overtopped by gorgeous and expensive stone churches with golden or deep-blue domes that had risen out of the penury of these poor peasants, one could not much wonder at the hostility of the Soviets to the institutional religion.”</span></p>

Parts of the exhibit, so it is said, are teeth of Saints Peter, Elizabeth, Joseph and Christopher. Sometime, when conditions permit, it will be proper, if not expedient, to inquire as to the circumstances of how these people came to lose their teeth. If it can be proved that one of the saints pasted Chris so hard that some of his teeth dropped out, and a bystander picked them up to strengthen our present weak faith, then the names of all the actors should be sent in and we will publish the full story in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> About Elizabeth, we feel that there must be some mistake. Nobody who was anybody would hit a lady hard enough to dislocate any of her teeth, and it would not seem just ethical to pull them after she was dead. The story has its difficulties, no matter how one looks at it. Perhaps the slant to it that would be the least strain on our faith is that some dentist gave a handful of these to the priest who made up the exhibit, and he just attached the names of the saints to them because he thought the idea would go over better. That is probably it.</span></p>

As these were organized and held for the public welfare. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Gat de</span><span class="font7"> (the branch of the Watch 'Power Bible and Tract Society in Paris) displayed the hooks written by Judge Rutherford and which have been translated into French. At both expositions these books were awarded diplomas of merit, the basis of judgment here being, not the binding and other features of workmanship, admittedly excellent, but the literary contents. These awards express the liberal-mindedness and lack of religious prejudice, and an eye open to true worth and helpfulness, on the part of the judges, even though the expositions were <sup>C,</sup>placod under important and high political patronage'’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“The following two items may prove very interesting to those readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">who are not under the dominance of the allopathic cult. The first one was related to me by a chiropractor who has studied medicine for six years and subsequently studied chiropractic. He told me that while he was serving in the American army the doctors inoculated a company of 250 men with an anti-meningitis serum. Within two weeks 235 of the 250 were dead. He said that he was an eyewitness of this tragedy, and, since I have always found him to be a man of unquestioned veracity, I see no reason to doubt his story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I read the other article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Medicine and Surgery</span><span class="font7"> and it concerns the orthodox treatment of pneumonia which consists of the administration of digitalis to bolster up the heart when the disease reaches the crisis. A New York physician who was in charge of the pneumonia ward in a large hospital decided to try nursing and hygienic treatment in half of his cases, and gave the other half the regular treatment including the administration of digitalis. Of those who received digitalis 40 percent died, while of those who received only careful nursing 30 percent died. This would seem to indicate that the allopath’s efficiency in pneumonia is minus 10 percent.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">AYS Joseph Greig, pioneer: “As a knock-out for malaria and typhoid, the virtue of the red pepper, both in the sauce and in the raw form, is not well known as yet; hence this word of commendation at a time when the rainy spells are gendering these germs of stagnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Quinine has been the one remedy exalted by the medics when confronted with these foes of good health. But, like its twin sister aspirin, it has an after-effect not wholesome for the system. Hence the wisdom of the pepperist, as witnessed for centuries in the sunny South, where these malarial poisons get into the pores through the very atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Mark, therefore, how the wise southerner shoots his enemy with the chili and hot tamale ammunition, until he makes the system respond to pep through the mangoes and biting ingredients of nature’s ‘tastifiers’; for there are times when everything fails to bring quick action and one despairs of help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At such times, by casting around for a benefactor, one will find in nature’s wondrous laboratory a just-right preparation which, when linked eclectically with other proven 'healthi-fiers’, works the change which restores normality. Evidently no one set of doctors has a patent on perfect life; otherwise the Great Physician would be out of a job for His scheduled reign of a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Moreover, life comes through food and its proper assimilation. Wise, then, is he who eats the right thing for his present need, and likewise respects the words of Paul: 'Let no man judge you in meat or in drink, etc.’; for no two systems require exactly the same ration. Hurrah for the red pepper 1”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">AYS John M. Spielmann, of Michigan: “Have read all arguments about spraying apples, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> and will here express my standpoint of thinking. I came to this country from Germany, from Underfranken, which is known as the greatest fruit section in Germany. To my knowledge there has never been any spraying done on apples or other fruits except grapes, and they have been sprayed with bluestone, sulphur and fresh-made lime. I have been an overseer on a large farm, Neuhof by Wertheim a/m, which did belong to Furst von Lowenstein, Wertheim and Freudenberg, which is claimed to have 99 large farms, and we never did any spraying on fruits, due to the better care of trees and of the land. We never were bothered with bugs or germs, and always had good crops. I absolutely believe that spraying of apples or other fruits or vegetables with poison is very injurious to human health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To grow fruits without spraying them, try this: Every year, in the fall, when the leaves begin to fall, scrape off the loose bark, whitewash your tree with fresh-made lime from limestone. It must be fresh-made from limestone or it has no strength. Then cut a parchment paper a foot wide, and tie this paper around the tree below the limbs with two strings and paint this paper with moist tar and black wagongrease. You have to heat this and stir it well. Repeat this every year in the spring and fall. Plow your ground two times a year, at least, and dig the ground up deep under the trees. In the fall, after the leaves fall, when you dig the ground, give them horse or cow dung, in the rainy season; and in the springtime, in the rainy season, give them stable or toilet water, and you have done your share.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">W. C. Harman, M.D. (Va.), in September issue, I would like to tell of an experience we had in this connection while on a farm a few years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We had four young dogs. My husband learned that he could get stale baker’s bread, white predominating, at one cent per pound, and did so, thinking to economize in food for swine and chickens and for these dogs. We were told that, soaked in milk, it was splendid food for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“As anyone would have done, I threw out to each dog a half loaf of bread; and soon they began to have these running fits, exactly as described in Dr. Harman’s piece. I told my husband I thought the fits were caused by the bread; but he thought not, because, so he thought, the dogs could vary their diet by obtaining some flesh food, even from farm animals left unburied in the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“After a time there was a three- or four-day let-up in receipt of the stale bread, and we noticed that the dogs had no fits meantime. When we had used 350 pounds of this stale bread we could get no more, and the dogs have had no running fits since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While we were feeding the stale bread to our farm animals one half of the pigs in broods dropped their tails, losing them close up to their bodies. I am satisfied now that the real cause of their losing their tails was their feeding on this imperfect food.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Inflammation of the Gall Bladder</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is probably no class of persons that suffer so much from inflammation of the gall bladder as the clergy. They do not know that they have this complaint, and that makes it all the more pathetic. It comes, in their case, through having too much to eat, and nothing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The way it manifests itself is illustrated in a letter which the Great Falls ministerial association mailed to the chamber of commerce of that city. The chamber was in the midst of a campaign to improve the quality and quantity of the state’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">egg</span><span class="font7"> production, when it received from the ministerial association a motion, adopted by the ministers and signed by the secretary, which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That the chamber of commerce be asked to communicate with all farmers’ organizations concerned requesting that all eggs laid on Sundays be turned over to the association,” meaning themselves. Only a bunch of preachers could ever have shown the unmitigated gall necessary to make such a proposition; and as it is manifest that no healthy gall bladder could have produced such a demonstration, the inflammation of that organ in every member of the ministerial association is self-evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But if the ministers would only lay off from their weakness for fried chicken, roast chicken, chicken a la King, chicken croquettes, chicken fricassee and chickens and dumplings long enough to give the chickens a chance it is possible that some way could be found to gratify even this monumental piece of avarice and stupidity. But they cannot have the chickens and the eggs both; that much is certain. They would next be asking for all the milk the cows give on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Anonymous Essay on the Cow</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">^rpi£E cow is a female quadruped with an alto voice and a countenance in which there is no guile. She collaborates with the pump in the production of a liquid called milk, provides the filler for hash, and at last is skinned by those she has benefited, as mortals commonly are. The young cow is called a calf, and is used in the manufacture of chicken salad. The cow’s tail is mounted aft and has a universal joint. It is used to disturb marauding flies, and the tassel on the end has unique educational value. Persons who milk cows and come often in contact with the tassel have vocabularies of peculiar and impressive force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The cow has two stomachs. The one on the ground floor is used as a warehouse and has no other function. When this one is filled, the cow retires to a quiet place, where her ill manners will occasion no comment, and devotes herself to belching. The raw material thus conveyed for the second- time to the interior of her face is pulverized and delivered to the auxiliary stomach, where it is converted into cow. The cow has no upper plate. All of her teeth are parked in the lower part of her face. This arrangement was perfected by an efficiency expert, to keep her from gumming things up. As a result she bites up and gums down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The male cow is called a bull and is lassoed along the Colorado, fought south of the Rio Grande, and shot in the vicinity of the Potomac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A slice of cow is worth 8 cents in the cow, 14 cents in the hands of packers, and $2.40 in a restaurant that specializes in atmosphere.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">AYS L. H. Middlekaupf: “According to the Bible account the first Zaccheus was told, ‘Zaccheus, come down.’ He did so and received the message of the Kingdom first-hand, from the Lord himself. I recently had dealings with Zaccheus II and Zaccheus III. They did not come down; they stayed up, but they got the message of the Kingdom just the same. Here is the story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I spent the week of September 13 at Williamsport, Md., meeting and working with the little company at Hagerstown, working most of the time on Virginia avenue, which connects the two towns. On this highway is a gas station, eating place and miniature golf course combined, called ‘The Always’ (24-hour service). I ended my work at this point, exhausting my supply of booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The proprietor, to increase his business, engaged two young men to perform the pole-sitting stunt. The poles were about twenty feet in height, topped by easy chairs, covered by a canopy to protect the sitters from the elements. At the time of my call they had broken the world’s record, having been up 55 days. After serving two autos with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font7"> booklet one of the young men called down to know what kind of book I had. I asked him if he wished to inspect it. He said he did; so I attached one to his rope and he pulled it up. After looking it over he told me to get the 5c from the cashier. Then a young girl from one of the autos said, ‘Give Dan one, too.’ Dan was on the other pole; so I gave her one to loop on Dan’s rope. The man in the second auto handed me ten cents on behalf of the two modern Zaccheuses (sometimes spelled Jacchauses) and I went away happy.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">FRIEND has sent us a circular letter to his flock put out by the pastor of a church in the state of Washington. After explaining that the church has a debt of $16,000, which means an interest charge of $80 per month, and that the total collections have been only in the neighborhood of $100 a month, the pastor says feelingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To tell the truth, I am really discouraged, and I must say disgusted, at the cooperation which I have received in Raymond since my arrival. As you are well aware, I did not contract this debt, and I have labored diligently to take care of it; but in all my labors, I have had very little help or encouragement. If I call a meeting of the men of the parish to talk things over, two or three come; if I call a meeting of the ladies it is very little better. If I announce a choir practice or an altar society meeting, the same thing happens; and if I ask the people to wait after mass on Sunday there is a quick exodus immediately that mass is over. Lately the spirit seems to have taken possession of the altar boys, for even they argue and strive amongst themselves not to serve mass. This has led me to believe that the majority of the people do not want a church in Raymond. Perhaps you feel different; if you do, I would like to hear from you in the near future. I enclose a statement of what you gave in the collections from January 1 to September 30, 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Was It Had the Bible?</span></p>

Charles</span><span class="font7"> N. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Frost,</span><span class="font7"> of Illinois, says: “Last summer a worker called on the people of this town, and a few days after she was here one old lady told me that the minister had called on her and had told her that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">those people </span><span class="font7">did not have a Bible. They just had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">those books. </span><span class="font7">Last week I had a chance to talk with the minister myself. He does not believe in the prehuman existence of Christ. He said that in Genesis 1: 29 and 3: 22 God was speaking with the other gods, and that no one could prove that there was only one God. He also said that it would be just as sensible to think I myself dwelt somewhere in spirit before my birth. He thought I was rather strong on John, and when I spoke of other scriptures he said, Well, those are mostly all taken from Paul.’ He stated further that the Bible was not known of for hundreds of years, so how could one prove it was all true or whence it originated. I tried to talk to him and prove the Bible is true, that there is but one God and that Christ was with Him as the first creation; but he hushed me up and told me I was welcome to think and believe as I chose, and he would think and believe as he chose. He was very lofty. His name is Cecil Frasier, and he is a young man, just ordained this summer. He is a Mason, appears very sanctimonious, is well liked, and has a Bible from which he preaches every Sunday and thus makes his living, and tells that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">those people</span><span class="font7"> do not have the Bible, but only their books. I offered to lend him my books, but he ignored the offer.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“I am an old man (77 years of age), sick and poor, and have been meditating on the Kingdom conditions, sighing and crying for all the abominations that are part and parcel of our evil time. I submit a partial list of things which I believe will be abolished by the kingdom of our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and believe it might be a source of encouragement to some situated as I am if it were published. The list does not claim to be complete:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Armies, arsenals, assassins, banks, blasphemy, bombing planes, boards of trade, bribers, bribe-takers, capitalists, chambers of commerce, coffin-makers, congress, cowardice, crime, crop failures, dance halls, death, debauchery, debts, degeneration, devil, dishonesty, divorce court, disasters, doctors, drug stores, drunkenness, earthquakes, emperors, evictions, evil spirits, evolutionists, famine, fear, financiers, food adulteration, frontiers, gambling dens, generals, governors, grafters, gun factories, hags, hatred, hospitals, hunger, hypocrites, idiots, idleness, idolatry, ignorance, immorality, incompetence, insanity, injurious insects, interest, jazz, kings, lawyers, liars, ministers, monks, moonshine, morgues, morons, mortgages, mourning, narcotics, navies, nervousness, newspapers, nuns, old age, orphans, overwork, perplexity, pestilence, poison gas, police, politicians, poor farms, popes, pride, priests, prisons, profiteers, prostitutes, ravenous beasts, reptiles, revolution, ruffians, sickness, sighing, slavery, slums, soldiers, sporting houses, stool pigeons, storms, thieves, tramps, trusts, superstition, undertakers, vaccination, war, weeping and worry.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">xVi’S L. E. McNair, of Missouri: “In the year 1886 husband and I were engaged in Salvation Army work. Two altar boys, 'wicked,’ and doubtful regarding the ceremonies of their church, played a practical joke which nearly cost the life of the priest, and lost them their liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They put rat poison into the communion wine. They wanted to test the transubstantiation matter for themselves. If those holy words had </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">actually</span><span class="font7"> changed the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wine,</span><span class="font7"> of course the rat poison would also be changed with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A large number of confessions and subsequent absolutions were gone through with the next day, which was Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“As usual, the priest, overcome by the weight of sins, and the amount of wine he had partaken of, as the communicant gets only the wafer, was helped (they said 'dragged’) from the confessional, and was very sick; so sick that a physician was hastily summoned, a stomach pump used successfully, and his life saved. The altar boys, watching for results, were scared nearly to death. They told their parents, and they were severely punished, and hastily taken from their home to some institution miles away. This occurred in Brattleboro, Vt.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">sold, let us say, jewelry, books, stationery, etc. The owner kept a nice large stock, fresh and well chosen; but realizing that he had a clear monopoly he held his prices always at the very topnotch or a little beyond, so that most people simply could not buy, and 'got along<sup>5</sup> without. His customers became so few and far between that he felt he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font7"> jack up his prices still higher in order to live. This cut his customers still more, and then some one proposed the conundrum, “Why is Mr. ------’s store like home,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sweet home?’ The answer was, ‘Because it is the dearest place on earth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Bad became worse, and finally a rival store arose and the old monopolistic place became only an unpleasant memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am very hard of hearing; compelled to use a so-called ‘deaf-phone’, and my appliance cost, I believe, about $65. Now that sum of money is almost or quite out of the question for most deaf people in ordinary times: quite unthinkable during the present unemployment. I now need a much stronger instrument badly; but can I afford it? Not to any noticeable degree; I can’t!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yet that $65 (or higher) cost must lie principally in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">selling cost</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">profit,</span><span class="font7"> for I had mine apart a couple of weeks ago, for cleaning and to repair a broken switch-spring, and I made up my mind then that I would be glad to have a chance to make up a million of them for $10 apiece and would expect to clear up $1,000,000 on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It seems to me that people who run their affairs like the man who had ‘the dearest place on earth’ certainly ‘deserve their come-up-in’s’ and are pretty sure in the end to 'git ’em’, and I say, Peace to their ashes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saluting the Dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">AYS R. Oliver, of Ireland: &quot;Through the pages of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> we have been getting our eyes opened to the fact that we have been unwittingly rendering homage to the Devil himself by observing certain dates, customs, and ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We who wish to be entirely on the side of Jehovah desire to get rid of everything that savors of the enemy, and so we rejoice when these things are brought to our notice so we may more and more divest ourselves of everything that dishonors the name of Jehovah God. From this standpoint, I have often wondered if we were not paying homage to the enemy by rendering salutations to corpses, by doffing our hats or caps to the same, as the Scriptures declare that death is our enemy and is also the work of ‘the enemy’. May we not, then, although unwillingly so, be rendering homage to the enemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Of course, it may be said that salutations are a mark of respect to the relatives of the deceased; but I think the best respects we could pay to them would be to give them the message of the Kingdom, with its glorious hope for their dead friends, which would be more beneficial than saluting clay.”</span></p>

The churches are a business institution, pure and simple, controlled by a very small minority of our citizens, with very little benefit to those closely associated with it; with no benefit whatsoever to the vast majority outside its respective portals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The church buildings, as a rule, occupy the most valuable and sightly corners, the very best locations in all our cities and villages throughout our country, so that it is only just to assume that the real estate is of more value than the church buildings or edifices. Undoubtedly there is fifteen billions of actual wealth which to this day is not touched by a tax. For instance, a nominal rate of three mills levied upon this business institution would yield four hundred fifty millions of dollars yearly.”</span></p>

When the baby was two days old the Sunday school teacher came out and enrolled him in her Sunday school class. Seems that he will likely be a candidate for membership in the church, and thus increase the membership of the church. Here is another instance: In Abilene, Tex., a certain Baptist church was about to ‘die down’; so the pastor decided to bury the church and resurrect it. He ordered out a casket, had pallbearers and flowers, and preached the funeral service of the church. Some of the members didn’t understand what it was all about, and were crying and trying to find out who was dead. So the church died, and now the pastor says he is resurrecting it!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">H. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coyle,</span><span class="font7"> of Ohio, says: “In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden • Age</span><span class="font7"> No. 300 appears an interesting article entitled ‘Federal Council Associates’. One is always interested in this great organization because this combination, known as the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, has done about all it could to make the world safe for democracy, unemployment, starvation, high prices, etc., by cheerfully approving the late war, claiming that the same was from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Most of us had always thought that the Roman Catholic church had a monopoly, by virtue of ancient tradition, on the classification and grading and making of ‘saints’; but it seems not. The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America see the error, the futility, of honoring or bestowing titles on dead churchmen as in the old days, and are certainly up to date in lavishly strewing with unstinted hand these saintly titles upon the living for only a few dollars, the price rising according to and in proportion to the size, name and importance of the title bestowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It was a gigantic blunder to bestow honor, emoluments and glories on dead saints of the remote past; and certainly it is a sign of church-ly advancement and financial progress for eminent clergymen to follow the drift of modern times and big business by taxing the aspiring, ambitious living only, evidently on the principle that ‘a living dog is better than a dead lion’. How the world does change!”</span></p>

While the fact that Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s Representative is now present is vastly more important than the time of His arrival, yet the Scriptures disclose in no uncertain terms, and which we may now understand, just when He did return. It is always pleasing to Jehovah that His people search the Scriptures to ascertain those truths due to be understood in their season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus was on earth He spoke several parables relative to His return and the work to be done at that time. He also gave His disciples certain prophecies concerning the end of the world and the harvest, the fulfilment of which now forms a basis on which we might know the time of His coming and the work to be done. The truth is much like a quarryman digging into the mountainside in search of a stone answering to certain dimensions and consistency. Many days may be spent, and much labor. Here is marble that is very beautiful, but it does not have the required size; there is a white mass that has the required proportions, but the color is unsatisfactory and the consistency is not uniform. At last he hits upon a stone! What joy! It answers all of the requirements. His labors of many days have been rewarded. Just so, in the Lord’s due time He reveals to His people the truth concerning certain questions; and they know when they find it, because it answers the many requirements of the Scriptures. This gives to the Lord’s people confidence in Jehovah’s dealing with them, strength for their faith, and they go on rejoicing in the great work set before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nobleman Receives Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the many parables which Jesus spoke concerning the Kingdom one is given in Luke the nineteenth chapter, and this supplies a clue as to the time of His return. “He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.” It will be noted that the nobleman went away for the very purpose “to receive for himself a kingdom”. It logically follows that he did not return until after he had received the royal sovereignty. This is a point in harmony with other scriptures and with the facts as we now know them. According to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font7"> we find, “And it occurred, that at his return, having received the royalty.” Christ Jesus was the appointed One of Jehovah, but His return must await His receiving the royalty which assured Him of the highest station in the Kingdom and the privilege of acting with authority as the Father’s executive. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> translation has it in this manner: “And it came to pass when he returned, having received the kingdom.” The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth</span><span class="font7"> translation is uniform with the rest, and is specific in showing that He returned after receiving the regal power: “And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty.” The German </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Elberfeld</span><span class="font7"> translation is similar in thought: “And it happened, as he returned, after he had received the kingdom.” The conclusion must necessarily follow, and is supported by numerous scriptures, that the return of the Nobleman could not be before 1914, at which time the Kingdom began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before beginning aggressive operations in the earth and ousting the enemy, Jesus had to await the Father’s due time. Satan’s rulership over the nations was not disputed before the new kingdom began. The scriptures point out, “The Lord [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Christ Jesus], Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Psalm 110:1, 2) We cannot imagine that Jesus was at any time not active in some service of His Father, but the major activities of the Kingdom must await the time of Jehovah. Now that time has arrived. Satan has been cast out of heaven down to the earth, and Christ Jesus, the Nobleman, is ruling in the midst of His enemies. This shows that He begins His reign while the enemies are still active, seek to disrupt the new work and to destroy the remnant upon the earth who are giving faithful testimony to the name of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and His incoming kingdom. The vindication work for the name and word of Jehovah has begun. Christ Jesus, as the returned “nobleman”, is directing servants according to the parable, and He is now beginning to realize the joy that was formerly set before Him in the vindication of His Father’s name. All who have the same spirit of the returned Nobleman with zeal and great joy participate in lauding the name of the great Jehovah. “Jesus . . . , for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”—Hebrews 12: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joy of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the joy of the Lord is important to the Nobleman and also to His servants during His presence (Matthew 25:14-30), we may ask, What is the cause of this gladness of heart? Joy in a measure may be had by faith by believing that certain promises are certain of fulfilment at some future time because the almighty Jehovah will perform them. It is highly important, therefore, to rely upon the promises of Jehovah. Furthermore, joy in fullness is realized when we witness the fulfilment of the promises. Thus some faithful men and women on earth looked forward with eager expectation for the establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom. There was a measure of joy as the wise virgins prepared to receive the Bridegroom at the temple in 1918. But there was still greater joy when the faithful realized from fulfilled prophecies that the Nobleman not only had returned but had also established a new nation. (Isaiah 66:10) Furthermore, joy is realized when success and prosperity attend a friend or his cause which is held dear to the heart; and likewise sorrow comes over one when his friend is injured. The disciples were exceedingly sorrowful when Jesus was crucified; but they rejoiced in His resurrection. Not only do we rejoice in the return of the Nobleman now, but all who love the Lord rejoice in the success of the cause which He espouses. Those whose hearts are right toward Jehovah sing with one voice, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“0 </span><span class="font7">Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Psalm 118:25) Those who have been faithful servants of Jehovah and His Nobleman, according to the words of Jesus, have entered into the joy of the Lord. (Matthew 25: 21) The conclusion must be that those rejoicing in Jehovah’s service now love the Lord and His work, and the Almighty strengthens them to be His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom parables of Jesus which describe the conditions of the harvest and the work of His followers could not possibly have application prior to 1914. The physical facts in fulfilment of prophecy show that we have reached the end of the age, or world, since 1914; and Jesus said, “The harvest is the end of the world.” (Matthew 13:39) Christ Jesus, as the Nobleman and Judge representing Jehovah in the harvest work, would have an active part in that work. The beginning of the harvest marks the appropriate time for Him to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You may have walked on a country road on a summer day and have seen a sign in the far distance as you approached a certain city. On the sign, as you thought at a distance, would appear a statement of the founding of the city, and a brief history. What it was all about was a mere guess. On approaching the sign you read it carefully, but it was different from what you had expected, and you did not at that time realize the things described thereon. It was not until you had gotten into the city that you realized the sight of the beautiful parks, the refreshing waterways, and the busy hives of industry. Just so, a number of people who had faith in the Lord had been walking Kingdom bound, when they came to the time for the Lord to set up His kingdom. It was not until several years later that they realized what the Lord was doing; and we can thank Jehovah that we are still learning, not for the knowledge in itself, but that one might be better equipped to laud and serve the great Jehovah. Many of the things are now seen more clearly; many of the things that we once thought we knew were mere guesses, and we have thrown them overboard. We have now come into the new city of God; we are better acquainted with the great Jehovah, know more about the Nobleman and the privilege of working under Him; we now begin to see things as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Parousia of Nobleman</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to 1914 and years thereafter we thought that our Lord’s return dated from 1874; and we took it for granted that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font7"> or presence of our Lord dated from that time. An examination of the scriptures containing the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font7"> shows that the presence of the Lord could not date prior to 1914. The word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia </span><span class="font7">occurs twenty-four times in the New Testament; and the first place where it occurs Jesus gave unmistakable evidence as to its application. It is for the thoughtful guidance and the instruction of His people that Jehovah has time and again given us definitions and necessary descriptions of names and important statements where they first appear in His Word, or when such are first given to His servants. Take for example the idea which we have of the word “God”, in Genesis 1:1, as the 'Creator of heaven and earth’, of “Abraham”, in Genesis 17:5, as 'a father of many nations’, and of “Jesus”, when the angel, announcing His coming birth, many years before any of the New Testament was written, said, “for he shall save his people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21) Just so, when the disciples asked Jesus, “What shall be the sign of thy presence </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[parousia],</span><span class="font7"> and of the consummation of the age?” (Matthew 24:3) the Master gave unmistakable evidence of its proper application. For some time now many have believed that the things mentioned in the great prophecy of Matthew twenty-four have application since 1914 and not before. It necessarily follows, then, that the presence or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font7"> of Christ, the “nobleman”, could not be before 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conditions During Parousia</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same great prophecy Jesus said, “For as the days of Noah, thus will be the presence </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[parousia]</span><span class="font7"> of the Son of man. For as in those days, those before the deluge, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and pledging in marriage, till the day that Noah entered the ark, and understood not, till the deluge came, and swept them all away; thus will be the presence of the son of man.” (Matthew 24:37-39) Not that it is wrong to eat, drink and marry, but Jesus indicated that these tilings would be among their chief pleasures rather than the love of God and His service. And have not these things obtained especially since the new King has been placed upon His throne? “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, . . . traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.”—2 Timothy 3:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In recent years, by the grace of Jehovah, we have been privileged to learn that those who had fallen asleep in Christ during the age were awakened in the presence of the Nobleman. The purpose of their awakening was that they might become a part of Jehovah’s temple for the vindication of His name. God’s people have learned of Him that this active work began in the invisible realm of Jehovah in 1918 and was taken up by the remnant on earth in 1919, but specially in 1922. The apostle Paul refers to those that had fallen asleep as “they that are Christ’s, at his coming [presence, from the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia]”. </span><span class="font7">Again he refers to their awakening: “We which are alive, and remain unto the coming [presence, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia]</span><span class="font7"> of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep.” (1 Thessalonians 4:15) Paul the apostle expected to be included in the number who would be raised from the grave and be given the crown of life at the return of the great Nobleman. And be it noted he expected His appearing and also the crown and awakening </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">at that day.</span><span class="font7"> That day began in 1914; and it was in 1918, as the Scriptures show, that the early faithful followers were awakened. “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”—2 Tim. 4: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lightnings During Parousia</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another text that will bear consideration at length is that found in Matthew 24: 27: “As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming [presence, from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia]</span><span class="font7"> of the Son of man be.” The language of Jesus applies specifically to the time of His coming to Jehovah’s temple and the gathering of the approved ones into the temple condition. (Malachi 3:1-3; 2 Thessalonians 2:1) Since that time God’s people have reason to expect a better understanding of the truth concerning Jehovah’s purposes. Since seeing the meaning of God’s lightnings this text is better understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “lightning” in this text does not mean “bright shiner”. In the same verse the word “shine” appears and is translated from the Greek </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">phaino.</span><span class="font7"> The word simply means to shine or to appear brightly or to cast illumination, and is often rendered 'appear’, 'be seen,’ or 'shine’, in the English. The word “lightning” in this text is derived from the Greek word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">astrape.</span><span class="font7"> This latter Greek word is thought to be derived from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">aster,</span><span class="font7"> which means star, evidently from the prominent feature of the star, to wit, the twinkling or flashing of light. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font7"> renders the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">astrapto</span><span class="font7"> as flashing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “sun” is derived from the Greek word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">helios.</span><span class="font7"> In the same conversation, and in verse twenty-nine of the same chapter, Jesus used the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">helios,</span><span class="font7"> or sun. It seems quite certain that He would have used the same word in verse twenty-seven had He intended the thought to be that His presence would be like the sun rising in the east and shining to the west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Heretofore it has been said that Jesus must have referred to the sun in verse twenty-seven, because that body does rise in the east and gradually shines to the west and is the only body that fulfils this description. It is true that lightnings do not always appear in the east and reach to the west; nor does that seem to be the meaning of the words of Jesus. Rather this is the meaning : Lightnings come from one part of the heavens and shine forth unto all parts, and are therefore not local. Frequently the lightning appears in one part of the heavens and its reflections are seen long distances away in other parts of the heaven. That such was in the mind of Jesus when speaking is borne out in His words recorded in Luke 17:24, wherein He was speaking of the same matter. “For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.” The important fact is that the flash of lightning is for the information of those who are watching and is not confined to any local place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nobleman at Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Evidently Jesus then had in mind the time when He would come to the temple which God would build; that He would come for judgment, which judgment would include His denunciation of the false temple foreshadowed by Herod’s temple and the complete fall of the Babylonish systems. Since the words of Jesus on this occasion were in answer to the disciples’ question as to the end of the world and the sign of His presence, we must make the appropriate application thereof. The year 1914 marked the end of the world and the time when Jehovah placed Christ Jesus upon His throne as the rightful King of the world. Three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in 1918, Jesus came to the true temple of God, first for judgment upon the true house of God, and then for judgment upon the professed house of God, which judgment includes the complete destruction of Satan’s organization, including the professed temple.— Psalm 11:4-6; 1 Peter 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to 1914 there was no evidence of the fulfilment of our Lord’s prophecy as set forth in Matthew 24. From 1914 to 1918 the Bridegroom seemed to tarry and the “evil servant” class became unfaithful and therefore manifest. The motive of the “evil servant” class was selfish, because they had been looking to the time when they might receive a reward for themselves. Those unselfishly devoted to the Lord remained faithful and were faithfully representing the Lord the best way they could when He came to His temple, and of these faithful and approved ones is made up “that faithful and wise servant”. To the “faithful and wise servant” the Lord committed all His goods, to wit, His Kingdom interests. He brought these faithful ones into the temple condition, gave to them the garments of salvation, and covered them with the robe of righteousness.—Matt. 24: 45-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The World War ended in 1918; and later the faithful anointed ones awakened to the fact that there must be given a wide witness to the nations of all the world concerning God’s purpose, and particularly the evidence relating to the Kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Matthew 24:14) The Lord was then in His temple enlightening the minds of His faithful ones. The false Christs and false teachers have appeared and spoken their “wisdom” even as Jesus foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now with this setting of the text of Matthew 24:27 let us consider the text and the context together. Jesus said: “Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.” (Verses 25, 26) Jesus was warning His followers against deception that might be practised upon them by false teachers concerning the place where Christ would be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is Jehovah who makes the lightnings. (Jeremiah 10:13) Jehovah is the One who gives light to His people through His Chief Executor and Nobleman, Christ Jesus. Therefore the Lord was giving warning to His followers that the light concerning His presence would not come from someone who spoke of His being in a specific place. Hence He said: ‘If some human creatures, who cannot make lightnings and who cannot make the truth, say unto you who are of God’s anointed class and in the temple condition, Behold, he is in the desert or in the secret chamber, do not believe them.’ “For as the lightning [flashes of divine truths originate with</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah and are sent to the members of His organization through the Head thereof, Christ Jesus] cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west [and is therefore not merely in one place]; so shall also the coming [presence] of the Son of man be?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other words, Christ Jesus, the returned Nobleman, would not be located in some private place, but would be in His temple, “in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17), and the light that would illuminate the minds of the temple class concerning His presence would come from Jehovah and would shine to every one of the temple class, regardless of what part of the earth He might be in. This thought is borne out by Luke 17:24. This conclusion is borne out also by the facts. It has been since 1922 particularly, several years after the arrival of the Nobleman, that His faithful people here upon the earth have been illuminated by the flashes of lightning which informs them of the new work to be done. As time went on in subsequent years His people on earth learned of God’s organization and the enemy’s organization; and then comes the climax : the revelation of Jehovah himself and the giving of His name to His witnesses upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore it may be said with propriety that the “east” represents the position of Christ Jesus relative to the members of His body who are on earth; that the flashes of God’s lightning come from Him through Christ to His church, and that therefore the flashes of God’s lightning that illuminates the minds of the faithful anointed do appear from the east (by and through Christ) and shine unto the west, that is, to the relative position of the body members on earth. It shines into the minds of God’s faithful, regardless of where they may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can note, therefore, that the long-awaited Nobleman has returned; He has set up the kingdom of Jehovah for the vindication of His Father’s name and the subsequent blessing of all the obedient of mankind; He has separated the “evil servant” class from His righteous followers ; and He, as the Representative of the Father, has given to the witnesses of the Most High new interests and work in the Kingdom and great joy fills the hearts of those who have waited in faith, because they love the Lord and His service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Thirty*five Centuries of Free Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font7">O OTHER liberty is so fundamental or so essential to human happiness, progress and prosperity as the liberty to express freely one’s honest convictions and to convey to others such information as may be of benefit to them. There is only one class that could object to the freedom of expression and the free use of the means of communication by those who have a message for the people. It is the class whose works are unrighteous and who therefore find it necessary to lay their plans and find their security in darkness. Anything that would tend to throw light upon their activities or call in question the justice or fairness of their course would be most unwelcome. They will not bring their deeds to the light, because their deeds are evil. More than that, they will not tolerate others to enlighten the people and to give them the truth, because their own works would in contrast be seen in their true light and they would therefore be condemned, and properly so. Hence the workers of iniquity have been and are willing to resort to violence and crime to evade detection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Honest men have at all times brought their works to the light. They have had nothing to hide from others. They could afford to be open and aboveboard. Not only so, but they have let their light shine, and this has reproved, directly or indirectly, those whose works were evil. In heathen countries whose peoples knew not God there have been sincere and honest souls who have fearlessly sponsored the right and opposed the wickedness of selfish men who enriched themselves at the expense of the public good. In the record of the Bible we find men who not merely were impelled by a sense of duty, but were guided by divine instruction, in their denunciation of transgressors. They delivered a divine message, and no amount of opposition or attempted interference prevented them from carrying out their God-given mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophets of Israel were notable for their fearless declaration of the laws of God and their defense of the rights of the people. No doubt attempts were made to silence them, and a number of cases are on record where the prophet suffered much for his faithfulness in doing as commanded. Whether the privilege of free speech was granted them or not, they delivered their messages. Moses stands out as a notable example of one who braved the ire of a powerful ruler in delivering a message from God which was undoubtedly most unwelcome. Moses was, first of all, the servant and representative of God. He was, further, the champion of the liberties of the people of Israel. “Let my people go,” was the message which Moses conveyed to the king. Subsequent messages impressed upon Pharaoh the importance of giving heed to Moses. Pharaoh had not yet conceived the idea of censorship; for Moses seems to have enjoyed the privilege of free speech, even though his message was an unwelcome one. Free use was made of whatever opportunities presented themselves to get the ear of the proud oppressor. The time may have been inconvenient to Pharaoh, but it was convenient to Moses. When Pharaoh came out to have a dip in the river, Moses told him that the Lord Jehovah had something to say to him, and then proceeded to drive home his message by turning the water into blood. Moses got his message across, and only after the ninth plague did Pharaoh become reckless and put the gag on Moses. He told him not to see him again, on pain of death; but Moses had accomplished God’s purpose and delivered his message. Pharaoh had to send for him finally and acknowledge defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another occasion on which the right to free speech was exercised to accomplish God’s purpose was when King David had transgressed the law which God had given to Israel. Though he was king he had been carried away by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">beauty of Bathsheba, and in order to get out of the resulting predicament he had contrived to so arrange matters that her husband was slain in battle. Nathan the prophet boldly called the king's attention to the fact that his sin was not hid from Jehovah. David was sincerely repentant, but, though he did escape the extreme penalty of the law, he could not go unpunished, and he accepted the death of Bathsheba’s child as just recompense for his sin. The king, so far from resenting the boldness of Nathan, humbly confessed his sin, and was reinstated in divine favor. He did not despise or resent the chastening and correction of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another example of the use of free speech is that of Elijah. He opposed the idol-worship prevalent in Israel in the days of Ahab and Jezebel. He kept after King Ahab and, at the command of the Lord, took him to task for his wickedness. When the king had conveniently disposed of Naboth and taken possession of his vineyard, Elijah was on the job and gave the king a message that put a definite end to his unholy joy at having obtained the vineyard. When after the three years of drought Elijah presented himself to Ahab, the king said to him, “Art thou he that troubleth Israel!” Elijah boldly replied, &quot;I have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord.” And then he challenged the king to have it out, saying, 'Get the prophets of Baal together, and let them offer a sacrifice, and I will do the same, and we will see who is worshiping the true God.’ The result of the contest demonstrated clearly that Elijah was serving Jehovah, the true God, while his opponents, though hypocritically claiming to serve the Lord, were really serving the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the greatest example of boldness and freedom of utterance was that of our Lord Jesus Christ. The scribes (clergy) and Pharisees and the whole priestly tribe, then as now, were opposed to the truth of God, and did not stop at any means to discredit and besmirch the Son of God and misrepresent His message. Jesus did not revile again, but the time came when in defense of the truth He exposed the whole impious crowd, and He did it so thoroughly that they determined to “get him” at all costs. So they gathered their henchmen, bribed Judas, enlisted the aid of the government, suborned false witnesses and obtained the cooperation of a dissolute and unscrupulous mob to accomplish their purpose. Jesus was “arrested” and brought to trial, accused of “sedition”, a favorite charge with those who are of Satan’s world and not of God. Jesus might have saved himself had He not openly and freely confessed the truth before Pilate. He had come to bear witness to the truth, and He made no effort to evade the inevitable consequences of His faithful acknowledgment of the fact that He was what He was, a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus told His followers that they would receive the same treatment He had received; and so it is. He was the faithful and true witness, and His followers must likewise be truly and faithfully Jehovah’s witnesses. They have His example and that of the prophets, and willingly endure the opposition they have to contend with. The clergy and the principal ones of their flocks, corresponding to the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day, have put every possible obstacle in the way of a proclamation of the message of Jehovah’s witnesses. Time and again they are denied halls in which to hold meetings; newspapers refuse to carry their advertisements ; officers of the law arrest them for “putting out handbills” or for calling on the people at their homes; radio stations are coerced into denying them time on the air, though they are willing to pay the proper rates. It will be seen that in this way every avenue of publicity would be closed to the proclamation of the truth and that if Jehovah’s witnesses did not resist these unjust and unlawful discriminations by every means in their power they would be effectually restrained from carrying out their commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By Jehovah’s overruling providence, however, there are still manly men who will not accede to the demands of the clergy, and the message therefore continues to go forth by radio and in various other ways, while Jehovah’s witnesses submit to persecution, arrest and imprisonment when necessary to maintain their right to call on the people at their homes and bring them the message of God’s kingdom by word of mouth and by means of the printed page. Though officers of the law harass them and arrest them on the pretext that they are “peddling or soliciting without a license”, they go on. They know that they are bearing the truth to the people and that they have the right to do so. The fundamental law of the land provides that they shall have the liberty to serve God according to their understanding of His will, and though judges are frequently pleased to ignore this most important factor in their work and to stigmatize it by calling it “peddling” and “bookselling” or “putting out advertisements”, they know, and the judges should know, that it is none of these things, and that no license can properly be issued to grant them permission to do what God’s Word commands them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing examples show that the testimony and warning must be made known by all available means of publicity. They show that the ones entrusted with this work must be faithful in performing it, and that those who heed the warning will have mercy extended to them while those who refuse to give heed will be deserving of divine disapproval and judgment. Those who resist the truth line themselves up on the Devil’s side. They clearly identify themselves as those who come not to the light lest their works, which are evil, should be exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let the truth be freely spoken by word of mouth, by printed page and by radio, and let no self-appointed censors attempt to set a limit upon the proclamation of the message which Jehovah’s Word has for this day.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>The Inconsistencies of Science</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font7">INCE science is so boldly accusing the Bible of all the inconsistencies of reason, what can you say of science to show its own inconsistencies ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Science claims to be so pure that its every utterance is truth even from the time it was a one-cylinder protoplasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enclosed is a “scientific” article which glorifies science and craves for more glory. [We reproduce four paragraphs from the article.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early scholars, looking for the solution of mysteries, turned nowhere but to the old Hebrew legends. Dr. Lightfoot, the vice chancellor of Cambridge University a few hundred years ago, could blandly announce that man was created at 9 a.m., October 23, 4004 B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As late as 1850 a great Egyptologist changed the dates he found in his researches so that they would not conflict with the dates of Noah’s Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today poor Doctor Lightfoot is remembered only as a joke and an evidence of pitiful bigotry, for today there is hardly a respectable scientist who believes that man was created at all in the sense that Doctor Lightfoot implied. Today there is hardly a scientist who takes the bigots into consideration when he works with telescope, microscope, test-tube or the geologist’s hammer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And yet we still go on ignoring the splendor of the scientific achievements; we still delay to give them lofty recognition as the chief friends of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In reality the article established the Bible truth that all men are liars, especially the scientific kind, that ‘worked itself from the ocean depths millions of years </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ago’</span><span class="font7"> and now crowns itself as monarch of all it surveys. The casual reader of the gospel knows that it contains a message more noble than science has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By James 8. Watson (Honolulu)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scientists accuse Christians of hindering science in its search for knowledge. But since science is busy patting itself bn its protoplasmic head for its discoveries, let it tell how its discoveries and inventions of most cruel instruments blotted out ten million souls in the last war and crippled thirty millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let it tell how it has perfected these instruments so that in the next war it will be able to blot out its tens of millions instead of mere millions. Let it tell how harmonious science is by explaining how the German science used all its science to destroy allied science, all to glorify science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let science tell who, during the Dark Ages, invented the scientific instruments that were used to destroy fifty million souls, while the doctors were busy prolonging the agony of the tortured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Science has discovered some things and used its discoveries to awe mankind. They claim to help mankind; but mankind foots every bill; so the poor remain poor, and the rich, rich. All this shows that science is guilty of all the deviltries of which it accuses others. Science could have helped mankind, but it has faithfully served the god of this world. But we joyfully and hopefully trust that it will more faithfully serve earth’s new King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is to be hoped that the editor will enlarge upon this, not by way of hating science, but to show that the kettle is just as black as the pot, and that the gander should not kick at receiving goose sauce.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Suppression of Free Speech in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7"> BILL passed unanimously by the Manitoba legislature provides that the repeated publication of anything calculated to expose persons belonging to any creed to ridicule shall entitle such person to sue for damages and injunction to restrain further publication. The manifest purpose of this bill is to prevent honest criticism of the doctrines of hell-fire, purgatory, and other indefensible relics of the Dark Ages. Widely lauded as an “anti-hate” bill, it is, in reality, a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">b&gt;itter hate</span><span class="font7"> bill of the worst sort. Similar bills are projected in all the Canadian provinces, and have been launched in New Jersey and other centers of intolerance in the United States.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Freedom of Speech in Britain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font7"> has a cartoon of a national personage giving a talk on free speech under the auspices of the British Broadcasting Company. As he talks he stands on a trap door, under the control of an operator who can speedily drop him into the cellar if he says anything off-color. Over his head is a ton weight which can be dropped by another operator, to make sure of his exit. He is surrounded by smiling officials, one of whom has a gas tank wherewith to asphyxiate him, another has the fire hose ready to turn on him, a third has a sand bag with which to sock him, a fourth has a death hood to pull over his head, while a fifth is at the controls to shut him off the air the moment he says anything offensive to the censors of the British Broadcasting Company.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Estonia and Bulgaria Go Fascist</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font7">STONIA and Bulgaria having gone Fascist, there is a solid belt of Fascist countries all the way from the Upper Baltic to the Mediterranean sea, including Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy. But for the Lord, the outlook for liberty-lovers in the world would be dark indeed. The Fascist victory in Austria was accomplished by the government troops’ “bravely” shooting women and children, shelling apartment houses in which the Socialist workmen made their homes. A hospital also was shelled by the government artillery. One artillery officer obeyed the command of his superiors to fire on the apartment house in which his own wife and children lived.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The question before the American people—a question that is inextricably interwoven with the policies and experiments of the moment—is this: Do we want a democratic or a collectivist system ? Do we want freedom as individuals to live our lives under the Constitution and free courts; do we want individual opportunity and scope to work out our private and business lives within sane and law-abiding limits or do we want to be regimented—told what we can do, how much we can do and when we can do it; do we want a free press, a free radio and free speech, or some one to tell us what we can think and what we can say? . . . The Democratic party has cut loose from its traditions and stands for a strongly centralized, bureaucratic government that is getting a grip on every kind of private business and putting into effect many extremely radical measures that look toward ultimate collectivism. ... It is impossible to escape the conclusion that today we are having government by amateurs—college boys, irrespective of their age—who, having drunk deep, perhaps, of the Pierian spring, have recently taken some hearty swigs of Russian vodka. We cannot solve our problems with a discredited European ideology and a Marxian philosophy. The great illusion of the moment is that we can gain any worthwhile happiness or prosperity by the sacrifice of our hardly won liberties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Democracy is far the most difficult form of government because it requires for perfect functioning the participation of everybody. Democracy wants constant guarding, and for us to turn to a dictatorship would be an act of consummate cowardice, of surrender, a confession that our strength and courage alike had gone. It is quite true the wheels of our State coach may be creaking in heavy ground, but are you sure the wheels of the coach are not creaking in Moscow, Berlin and Vienna and even in the United States? The whole tendency of a dictatorship is to squeeze out the competent and independent man and create a hierarchy accustomed to obeying. Chaos often results when the original dictator goes.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE triumph in Austria was the triumph of the pope over socialism. That is putting it bluntly. The socialists, fought bravely for the preservation of their rights, but they stood no chance. The municipal tenements, housing 200,000 persons in ideal conditions, were recognized as a model all over the world. To their lasting shame the Roman Catholic troops shelled these apartments. One of these, the Karl Marx Hof, consisted of 1,200 apartments, each having separate stairs, a balcony and at least one room exposed to the sun; there were separate kindergartens, assembly rooms, laundries and bathhouses. It was built around spacious landscaped courtyards, with ornamental statuary and pools. In defending their homes the socialists descended to the sewers, but all in vain. The forces of the pope are in full control. Even the jobs held by socialists in the government were declared forfeited. To all intents and purposes the republic of Austria has ceased to exist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N AN address in the House of Representatives Hon. George Foulkes, of Michigan, called attention to the fact that in the past three years the United States expended $60,000,000 more on its navy than the combined navies of France, Italy and Japan, and twice the sum that Great Britain spent on its navy; that during the past three years Japan expended $381,000,000 and the United States $4,000,000,000, while the sum desired for this year is a billion and a quarter. Coming directly to the point he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Do you know that ignorance is rampant in our land; that young men and women are unable to secure the educational advantages that would fit them for good citizenship ? This one appropriation alone would endow 2,078 colleges with $500,000 each to carry on this most-desired and benevolent work. Did you know that the more than $4,000,000,000 appropriated for destruction of human life within the past few years would redeem every farm mortgage within the United States, thereby leaving the sorely distressed agriculturist the master of his own home and securing the destiny of his children? Did you know that this one appropriation alone now being demanded would build an 18-foot concrete road at the cost of $20,000 a mile for a distance of 52,000 miles, equal to 16 paid highways across the American continent from New York city to San Francisco, and that literally hundreds of hospitals, now so badly needed, could be endowed for a mere fraction of this amount ? ’ ’</span></p>

The Inland Waterways Corporation on the Mississippi river, owned by Uncle Sam, gets 40 percent of its charges from shippers and the other 60 percent as a present from the taxpayers. It costs the taxpayers of New York state $5 a ton for every ton of freight that traverses the barge canal. The postage on air mail letters defrays less than half the actual cost.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Priority of Labor</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Abraham Lincoln </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(From a message to Congress In 18G1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7"> SEE in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me, and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of war, corporations have been enthroned, and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money pow’er of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of our country than ever before, even in the midst of war. God grant that my forebodings may be groundless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a refuge from the power of the people. In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit to raise a warning voice against the approach of returning despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask brief attention. It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else owning capital, somehow by the use of it, induces him to labor. Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could not have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration. I bid the laboring people beware of surrendering the power which they possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to shut the door of advancement for such as they, and fix new disabilities and burdens upon them until all of liberty shall be lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the early days of our race the Almighty said to the first of mankind, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,” and since then, if we except the light and air of heaven, no good thing has been or can be enjoyed by us without first having cost labor. And inasmuch as most good things have been produced by labor, it follows that all such things belong of right to those whose labor has produced them. But it has so happened, in all ages of the world, that some have labored and others have without labor enjoyed a large portion of the fruits. This is wrong and should not continue. To secure to each laborer the whole product of his labor, as nearly as possible, is a worthy object of any government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems strange that any man should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing bread from the sweat of other men’s faces. This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All corporations shall be conducted on a profit-sharing basis, the charge upon each being minimum and maximum compensation for all employees—manual laborers, clerks and officials—in no instance to be less than $14 a week or greater than $500 a week until the corporation is earning 6 percent on its capital stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When any corporation shall earn over 6 percent, after setting aside reasonable reserves, paying fixed charges and minimum wages, the excess earnings shall be distributed among all employees in such proportion as shall be determined by vote of all stockholders and employees present in person at the annual meeting. The business policy of the corporation shall be determined by a similar vote, and the officers and employees selected in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Competition to maintain fair prices for consumers shall be kept free by enforcing the anti-trust laws. All directors of any corporation infringing those laws shall be liable to imprisonment for a misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No corporation shall pay dividends higher than 6 percent a year; no stock dividends shall be permitted ; no stock shall be issued in excess of the fair value of the property as determined by federal experts; there shall be no splitting of stocks, no issuing of nopar stocks or stock under par, and no distribution of bonus stock; holding companies shall be forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All stock exchanges shall be conducted under federal regulation. Selling short, buying on margin or manipulation of stock shall be prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The federal government shall open banks in all communities similar to the postal savings banks except that they shall provide the same accommodation now afforded by commercial banks. No banks or bankers shall be permitted to have affiliated corporations for speculation in stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the currency of the country shall be issued by the United States Government, which shall endeavor to stabilize currencies throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Individuals and partnerships where full personal responsibility is assumed shall not be limited as to their net profits, but shall be bound by this code as to wages and hours.</span></p>

Our governor is trying to pass a liquor bill; the mayor believes that prohibition repeal means that the people want to be able to buy a drink. No one wanted to see the return of the old-fashioned saloon, so they have changed the name to “tavern”. Some people believe that drinking is O.K. if a fellow doesn’t stand up while he pours it down. That hoists the question, How should a fellow be allowed to consume the spirits, sitting, standing, leaning, or kneeling? If we can’t have saloons we are bound to have speak-easies. The difference between a saloon and a speak-easy is the way you get into the place. To convert a saloon into a speak-easy all one does is to lock the front door and open the rear, and pay for protection instead of tax. Women barflies are the new feature at the taverns, and all Chicago says they are an offensive nuisance, and there are more of them than can be reckoned. Well, anyway, it gives the preachers something to squawk about. I see Billy Sunday has started out to take in another fortune by running the Devil around and saving souls by the glass and stein; there is a fortune in those tabernacles.

<p><span class="font7">AYS Rupert Webb, of Pretoria, South Africa, in his little book entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Feed, Clothe and House the People:</span><span class="font7"> “It is a simple process to analyze the fungous growth of interest on money. We will therefore analyze one hundred pounds invested, as from the year 1800, at the low rate of interest, say 3|%, and find: In the year 1820 this £100 with added interest became £200; in 1840, £400; in 1860, £800; in 1880, £1,600; in 1900, £3,200; in 1920, £6,400; and in 1933, £10,000. These figures are not fairy tales; they are the truth and demonstrate the fallacy of attempting to continue further with a system that has been able to drag us down to the depression, starvation and the unemployed state in which we now find ourselves. We have, by some unforeseen force, survived from the £100 invested in the year 1800, which has now grown to £10,000; but what of the next 60 years, when the £100 will have reached the colossal figure of £80,000? Is it possible to continue with such a Hydra-headed monstrosity of a system which has been able to degrade a sound, healthy nation with poverty and distress?” Mr. Webb’s proposed remedy is the taxable currency originally proposed by Silvio Gesell, and a seemingly sensible method of gradually doing away with the interest system that Mr. Webb properly describes as a helpless, gibbering imbecile. The interest system will demonstrate its own complete idiocy to anybody who knows how to multiply and divide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ Three drops will kill. This gas will penetrate any mask, causing its removal and allowing the more deadly gases, with which it may be mixed, a clear field. General A. Ross, M.P., noted military medical man, claims that a portion of this gas mixed with 10,000,000 parts of air will put a human creature out of action in one minute. As far back as 1918 this gas was used on a herd of goats. All were killed but four. These four, in their agony, smashed their heads against fences. More so, it is stated by this general that the gas can be put up in five-pound containers, 600 forming a load for a commercial airplane. Two of these planes, not a military type even, can carry sufficient to destroy the population of London. Many more gases can be named. Take cacodyl isocyanide. One breath of this gas is absolutely fatal. Diethyl telluride will penetrate the skin without injuring it, yet this gas is 100 times greater in its effect than strychnine. With these gases, General Ross notes, a bomb of an incendiary nature, when dropped from a plane, develops a heat up to 3,000 degrees, piercing iron, steel and earth to get at gas mains. Two pounds of this gas is sufficient to destroy a large city.”</span></p>

These “flags” were papyrus, a tall, smooth-stemmed reed of triangular form, which grew to a height of ten or fifteen feet, and terminated in a tufted plume. From its smooth green stems was made, as early as 2000 B.C., a material called by the same name, “papyrus,” a crude paper. The outer rind of the stem was first removed, exposing an interior made up of numerous successive fiber layers, some twenty in number. These were separated with a pointed instrument, or needle, arranged side by side on a hard, smooth table, crossed at right angles with another set of strips placed above, and then dampened. After pressure had been applied for a number of hours the sheets were taken out and rubbed with a piece of ivory, or with a smooth stone or shell, until the desired surface was obtained, when the process was complete except for drying in the sun. Single sheets made thus were fastened together</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N SOME sections of Latin America nearly the entire population is leprous. Brazil has the largest number, probably 75,000. Chile has none, due to its temperate climate, rigid immigration policy and the barriers of mountains and deserts which shut it off from other Latin-American countries. Brazil, the melting pot of the world, now has 150,000 Japanese immigrants, and has just offered to receive 10,000 Assyrians.</span></p>

The night after it was discovered, he sat up all night with a rifle on his knees, his two sons sitting on either side of him with revolvers in their hands. With the dawn of day they bumped away to town to dispose of their find. The actual find was by a colored man employed by Jonkers. The stone, 726 carats, is pure white, flawless, and was found within three miles of the Cullinan, discovered in 1905. By some it is believed to be a part of the original Cullinan stone, which is the largest ever found, 3,025 carats, but, even at that, showed a fracture.</span></p>

There are flights of steps each step in which is a single square-cut stone twenty feet in length, ten feet in width, and three feet in thickness. There are many building blocks that weigh more than 200 tons each. These blocks were bound together with silver staples. When the Spaniards overran the country they upset everything in order to get the staples. The cutting of the stones was done with absolute precision. How the cutting was done, in view of the fact that steel was unknown, cannot even be guessed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNOUNCEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> is pleased to announce that a series of brief and illuminating talks by Judge Rutherford, covering a wide variety of Scriptural subjects, will appear in its columns, beginning with this issue. It is hardly needful for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> to express its conviction that these compact and worth-while lectures will be greatly appreciated by its readers. There is so much crowded into the compass of one of these articles that they will bear repeated reading and discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE name Jehovah applies exclusively to the Supreme Being. He is the Most High, above all. His name Jehovah signifies His purpose toward His creatures. He is the Almighty God, which means that He is the Creator of all things in heaven and in earth, and that His power is almighty and nothing can successfully resist Him. God created man and created the earth as a place for man to live. All men who will ever gain life everlasting must know and obey Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah provides two primary ways for man to gain a knowledge of Him: (1) by man’s observing the things created, which of themselves silently tell of a supreme power, and (2) by His revealed Word, which is the Bible, otherwise called the Holy Scriptures. Jehovah God long ago caused faithful men to write the Bible at His dictation, and this divine record is made for the purpose of giving man needed information. The Bible is the truth, and for centuries has successfully resisted all efforts to discredit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the human race are the offspring of one man, whose name was Adam and who was created by Jehovah God a perfect man. That man disobeyed Jehovah and was sentenced to death, after which all of his children were born; and for that reason all the human race by inheritance are sinners. The Scriptures truly declare that Jehovah God is love, which means that He is unselfish and that He does good unto all creatures without any gain to himself. Every act of Jehovah is prompted by love or unselfishness; hence He is wholly devoted to righteousness. It is His will that His creatures be wholly devoted to righteousness. He has provided the means for all men to gain a knowledge of the truth in order that they may learn the way of righteousness and live for ever in happiness. We have now come to the time when men are given greater opportunities than ever before to learn the way of righteousness and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is the giver of life; hence it is properly said of Him He is the fountain of life. His beloved Son is Christ Jesus, whose position in the universe is next to that of Jehovah. The purpose of Jehovah is to give life to obedient men by and through the ministration of Christ Jesus when such men are fully obedient to Him. For this reason Jesus said of Jehovah and for the benefit of men: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) No man can get everlasting life without knowing Jehovah and obeying Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A meek person is a teachable person, that is to say, a person who is willing to be taught. Jehovah’s promise to man is that He will teach the meek in the way that he should go; hence if a man seeks knowledge, earnestly desiring the same, God will reward his efforts. Jehovah has now brought to pass conditions in the world that make it possible for man to understand His name and His purpose, and for this reason He has supplied the means for understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah commands that all men shall love Him with a pure heart and must be obedient to His commandments in order to prove their love for Him. Such is not a selfish command, but is entirely unselfish and for the special benefit of man. There are mighty creatures that are called gods, because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">god</span><span class="font7"> means “mighty one”, but there is but one Jehovah, the Almighty God. He is the Eternal One, and there is none other who can give life everlasting to man. It would be inconsistent for God to give everlasting life to anyone out of harmony with Him, and therefore He tells man that if he desires to have everlasting life he must be obedient. Jehovah also commands that man shall make no image and worship that. That requirement is for man’s best interests. If a man devotes himself to an image or thing, that tends to turn his mind and his affections away from God and to lead him into destruction. All law and commandments of Je-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">hovah are for man’s good; and the more fully we understand them and obey them, the more we love Jehovah. That which is of greatest importance to man is to gain a knowledge of Jehovah as set forth in the Bible. “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sur e, making wise the simple.”—Psalm 19:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since God created the first man perfect, and all men are the offspring of that first man, why is there so much sickness, distress and sorrow and death amongst the human race? Is Jehovah responsible for all this sorrow and suffering amongst men, including death? Jehovah is not responsible at all therefor. The Bible answer to the question as to why these disagreeable things have come to pass will be answered in another speech called “Rebellion”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Twilight of Kings </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Annie Johnson Flint</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Reprinted from the Boston </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HREE kings there be, and one is mad, And one is weak, and one is old, And all are blind—they will not see</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hand that writes a doom foretold;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And all are deaf—they will not hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Voice that speaks, the word it brings—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Voice of the people and of God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This is the twilight of the kings!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From mountain pass, from fertile plain Where harvests wait the reapers’ tread, From vineyards on the sunny slopes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where dressers of the vines lie dead, From homes where starving children wait</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The father’s coming—and in vain, From pallid cheeks and voiceless lips</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of manhood wrecked and manhood slain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From smold’ring roofs and blackened walls,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From idle wheels of labor stilled,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From ancient battlefields, and new,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That reek of blood unjustly spilled,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A solemn Voice that eries aloud,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through all the world the portent rings: “The Sword shall free us from the sword—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the twilight of the kings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the twilight! Spent the day Of splendor, tyranny, and crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The long, long day that had its birth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the far-off dawn of time—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The day of iron band and heel, Of bondage, cruelty, and woe, The day of Babylon and Rome, Of Louis, Herod, Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The night that follows on that day</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Across the world its shadow flings;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outworn dynasties shall pass— It is the twilight of the kings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fast falls the night; beyond its gloom There shines the dawn of better things— The light of liberty and peace, Of justice higher than the kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When breaks that dawn no more one man Shall move a million at his will</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like pawns upon a chessboard played, To vaunt his power and his skill;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No more one man, by “right divine”, On age-old wrongs his house shall build;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No more the slogan “Might makes right” Shall serve his selfish greed to gild.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their glory fades as fades the day;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In fire and blood their sun has set, Though in the swiftly dark’ning skies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A smoky crimson lingers yet;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For hopeless, when the tide has turned, To fight against the trend of things, The thrones are rocking to their fall— It is the twilight of the kings!</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Questionnaire of “The World Tomorrow”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The World Tomorrow</span><span class="font7"> sent out 100,490 questionnaires to Protestant clergymen and theological seminary students, receiving 20,870 replies. Of the number replying, 17,023 were opposed to military training in public high schools and colleges and universities; 15,985 are in favor of substantial reductions in armaments; 15,598 believe that the policy of armed intervention should be abandoned; 13,997 believe the churches should go on record as refusing to sanction or support any future war; 12,904 are prepared to state that it is not their present purpose to sanction any future war or participate as an armed combatant; and 8,014 could not conscientiously serve as army chaplain on active duty in wartime. That is considerable shrinkage, but is worth noting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the expressions of those who said they believe the churches should go on record as refusing to sanction or support any future war were the following, culled from a number of different replies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“War is murder on a wholesale scale, and is incompatible with the teachings and spirit of Jesus Christ.” “War is hell! It kills human [creatures], love and fellowship, destroys property and civilization, breeds hatred, leaves poverty and ruin in its wake—and the church of Christ must oppose these things or die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For fourteen months I served as chaplain in France and Germany, and for the last fifteen years I have not been rid of the horrors of it for a full twenty-four hours. My position on war is unpopular, but the way I saw wholesale murder for several months has left me with no alternative but to curse the institution which has all but wrecked the world.” “The church denies the name of its Founder and ceases to be Christian to the extent that it participates in war. Christ is unequivocally opposed to war. War is murder on a wholesale, glorified scale. No murderer is a Christian.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What part has the gospel of love with rapine, murder, slaughter and bloodshed? You can’t whip the Devil by acting like him. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The record of the clergy in the years of the World War was indeed a dismal one. As one commentator remarked, ‘The pulpits reeked with blood.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If the churches have sincerely repented of their unchristian attitude and action during the World War, they can do no less than to put themselves on record as refusing to sanction or support a future war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have been a most blasphemous people, praying to God to aid us in murdering others of His creation. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE pathetic Palestine Pastors’ Association, Palestine, Texas, solemnly met and stated that “hearing that a petition was being circulated . . . for the purpose of preventing the ministers of the gospel from being denied the privilege of broadcasting their messages, the Palestine Pastors’ Association has asked the press to state that . . . The Pastors’ Association does not endorse the petition being circulated”. All of this is as we would expect, and all that it does is to help the people to see that the pastors are lined up squarely on the Devil’s side, and squarely against Jehovah and Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

McAvoy, Geneva Presbyterian church, Chesley, Ontario, Canada, has a thrilling 2|-column sermon in the Owen Sound </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun-Times.</span><span class="font7"> The sermon is devoted to proving that furniture, sweaters, automobile accessories, groceries, drugs, tobacco, meat, hay, shoes and ladies’ wear are as cheap in Chesley as in Toronto. Not sure if the reverend gent speaks with authority on the last item, but probably so. No Scriptures are cited, but if those storekeepers don’t come across with the long green, then there is no such thing as gratitude in this world.</span></p>

Sheridan, Curtis Baptist church, Augusta, Georgia, broadcast over WRDW urging his listeners to burn all books having J. F. Rutherford’s name or that of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society printed upon them. Thanks, “Reverend”! Every knock is a boost. “Ye know not what ye do.” And the clergy never do know; they don’t find out what it is all about until after it is all over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7"> QUESTIONNAIRE dated January 1,1934, was sent out to the clergy of the United States. It was signed by S. Parkes Cadman, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Edward M. Israel, M. Ashby Jones, William P. King, F. H. Knubel, Francis J. McConnell, John McDowell, D. P. McGeachy, Kirby Page, Daniel A. Poling, and William Scarlett. Of fifteen questions put to them, the very first one was, “Do you favor the immediate entrance into the League of Nations 1”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7"> FIVE-YEAR survey of church organization and life in the United States, Alaska and the West Indies, presented at the annual meeting of the Presbyterian Home Missions Council, Fifth Avenue, New York, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the last decade, Christianity to many has seemed to present but a glorified social service program. We have compromised and qualified until what remains of Christianity is but an anemic member occupying a place at the table of world religions. It is neither vital nor vitalizing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE big fellows are all jumping into the new program whereby it is to be made to appear that there is no essential difference between the Catholic, Jew and Protestant faiths. All that the people have to do is to go along where the clergy direct. In every state the campaign is under way, and the most influential men in the state are put on the committees that have the drive in hand. The real object is to prevent the common people from hearing about and accepting God’s truth and God’s way, His King and His kingdom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Warning to the Episcopal Church</span></h4>

Barton, professor at the Philadelphia Divinity School, in an address given at the annual Protestant Church Congress in that city, said of the Episcopal church that it is in danger of being blotted out, and added: “The church is in danger of becoming one of the greatest obstacles in the realization of the kingdom of God. The so-called sects are in many ways doing more in reaching people and bringing them to God than we who sometimes think we have a pipe line to the holy spirit through the historical episcopacy.”</span></p>

Massey, Sussex, writing in the London weekly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Everyman,</span><span class="font7"> thinks that in these days of soaring expenditures for armaments the consistent thing to do would be to recommend the worship of the inventors of poison gases instead of the Prince of Peace and a day should be set apart to celebrate “Strife on earth, ill will toward aliens”.

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HOSE who love the Word of God often sing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Blessed Bible, precious Word! boon most sacred from the Lord”. It seems not to have been the attitude of mind of Reverend Robert Wesley Hanford, M.E. pastor of Lansdowne, Maryland, when, in his Easter sermon, he hurled his Bible across the room and said, “Cursed be the church and cursed be the Bible when used to enslave God’s highest creation on earth, to enslave man created in the image of God.” The “Reverend” seems to have been peeved about something. The account says that he was “denouncing the fellow who says he is a Bible student”. Not certain, but it looks very much as if some Bible student had put something up to him, or at least to his congregation, that the dominie found not easy to explain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“We wanted money. We got it, and since we got it we’ve paid for it. The manufacturer poured metal into guns to kill youth; the government poured old rags into paper money and we were debauched in our own hypocrisy. The politician said the war was to unite the world, but it has done the opposite. We were all thankful when the butchery was over, but again the guns are ready to bark in the Far East. All the peace and economic conferences the nations have had, including the League of Nations, have been a failure. . . .

Two papal commissions are now examining the shroud to determine if it is genuine, and a book will be published on the subject.

<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">DDLY enough, it was on so-called &quot;Ground Hog Day” that the interview with the pope was published in which the pope urged worldwide prayer that Armageddon might be averted.

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE pope recently said to the Dominicans that when he gets ready to put the Inquisition in active operation again he wants them to be back on the job as the inquisitors, as they were of yore. That is interesting. And it now transpires that the Protestants are in training for their part as fellow-inquisitors. An inquisitor who balks at torture is of no good, and so the Devil is training a large and enthusiastic army in the school of vivisection. Protestants are strong for this. The Right Reverend T. Albert Moore, D.D., S.T.D., LL.D., moderator of the United Church of Canada, in a letter boosting the work of “the Canadian Social Hygiene Council, for the prevention of diphtheria through toxoid inoculation”, recently said: “It might also be pointed out that in the province of Quebec diphtheria prevention through toxoid inoculation has the unqualified approval of the Catholic church. Announcements urging parents to protect their children with toxoid are frequently made from the pulpit by the parish priests.” Toxoid is the new dope with which the vivisectionists are experimenting since they came to agreement that the toxin-antitoxin formerly recommended is really of no good. The Protestant churches in Canada recently issued an intermediate “Sunday School Quarterly” with a lesson in it on vivisection. Now wouldn’t it be a good joke, when the Catholic and Protestant inquisitions both get to going, under the direction of trained vivisectionists, if they should suddenly take up the idea of using one another’s officers as their subjects of experiment?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">N ITEM comes to us from Lehighton, Pa., giving the following details: “The priest came to a miner by the name of Anthony Ma-darea, who met with an accident last Wednesday. Madarea fell down a slope 150 feet when a large weight of coal, rock and dirt, estimated at 40 tons, gave way. His back was broken at several places; also both legs were broken from the hips, and both paralyzed; and he suffered internal injuries. He was unconscious until the Saturday following, but regained consciousness. The priest stated to him that if he paid $10 he would pray for him; he replied to the priest that he could not pay the $10; then the priest left his bedside in the hospital without offering a prayer for his recovery. This is true. The patient has no faith in him any more.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font7">OST people of common sense would say there is no virtue in torturing oneself. Nevertheless, a dispatch from Vatican City states that Maria Micaela was made a saint, the outstanding reason being that when she attended balls and parties, in the middle of the nineteenth century, she had beneath her clothing self-torturing devices. Nobody but the Devil would imagine there was any virtue in a scheme of that kind. Recently, a Washington (D.C.) undertaker disclosed that he had cared for the body of a poor Catholic woman who wore a knotted rope about her hips until her entire abdomen was one mass of callouses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>Odd Ute for the Missing Foot</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T SEEMS that in a church at Paris they had a foot of Saint Victor, said to be 1,600 years old. Recently somebody swiped it, and the priest in charge announces that in eternity the thief will be kicked by the foot which he stole unless he returns it. This raises interesting pictures in the mind. If you see a one-legged man in heaven or elsewhere bearing down on some luckless individual, and about to give him a swift kick, you will know that it is Saint Victor. If the kick lands all right an investigation will show that it was planted, not by the foot on which the one-legged man hobbles around, but by the one that was swiped from the priest. There doesn’t seem to be any reason why Saint Victor should not kick him with both feet, except that it is rather inconvenient to have both feet off the ground at the same time. If the priest had not told us which foot would be used we would suggest that Vic sock the man with his spiritual crutch and let it go at that. How did the priest get the foot in the first place? Maybe Vic came back and got it on the sly and the priest is in for trouble in the spirit realm, when he lands there, if he ever does. By rights Vic ought to both kick him and sock him with the crutch for keeping his foot in the show case 1,600 years, making him hobble all over heaven and other places so long without it.</span></p>

It seems, according to the circular, that “one mass heard by you during life will be of more benefit to you than many heard for you after death; you shorten your purgatory by every mass; you are blessed in your temporal goods and affairs”. The circular then adds, thoughtfully, “Inclose the amount in the small envelope, place it in the larger envelope, mail it to us, and we shall assume all responsibility in the transaction.” This all sounds very reasonable on the basis that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and the mass-purveyors would rather have your $2 now than trust to getting some from somebody else saying masses for you later. We can also see why they are willing to assume the responsibility. They evidently think they will never be called to account. But that is where they are wrong.</span></p>

In return the holder was to get either a wrist watch, a ton of coal, a luncheon set, a rosary, or a crucifix; awards under the lottery were to be made January 15,1934. Lotteries are illegal in the United States, and even if you had won the ton of coal it would have been bothersome to send it by parcel post across the border. But there is nothing to hinder your parting with the $1.25. Not sure if the “Sisters of the Precious Blood”, as they call themselves, would accept it, but you might try them and see. It must be all O.K.; for they do business under the protection of Saints Joseph, Anthony and Brigid of Ireland, and surely a saint ought to be on the level, anyway.

Another suggestion would be that he persuade the Devil, who he acknowledges is his partner, to turn the gas down a little, and not make the climate of this purgatory place so hot.

<p><span class="font5">“Take a bunch of carrots and a bunch of celery. Wash and cut into pieces. Put in kettle with about three pints of water and boil briskly for twenty minutes.

For a stubborn case take four glasses daily, at intervals. This is unfailing and can be continued until complete relief is effected.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By a Farmer’s Wife</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N JUNE of 1928 I went to my dentist for a dental examination and to make arrangements to have necessary work done on my teeth. Among other things, the dentist declared that my teeth were badly in need of cleaning. Sickness prevented my returning to him on the date set; and when I did go back for the work it was November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the interval I had not taken any better care of my teeth than previously; so you may imagine my surprise when he exclaimed, 'How nice and clean your teeth are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I”</span><span class="font7"> He said that my teeth did not need cleaning at all. This puzzled me for a while, and then a light began to dawn on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That autumn had brought us an abundance of very sweet, crisp turnips, and I had been eating them raw almost every day for several weeks. We served great slices of them at our meals, and ate them with bread, butter and a little salt. We seemed never to tire of them. I reasoned that the act of masticating the turnips not only scoured and exercised the teeth, but also liberated mineral-laden juices which both tended to correct unhealthy mouth conditions and served to nourish and harden the teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I had also been eating raw apples. Later the dentist suggested that these might have been responsible for the improved conditions. But I had eaten apples plentifully before, when turnips were not available, but without the same gratifying results, although there is no doubt that the apple is very beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is a salad of w’hich we do not tire, and which guests soon come to like as well as we do:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five or six large, crisp, sweet turnips Two or three medium-sized carrots One pulverized onion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One-half cupful raisins</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Run all but the raisins through a food chopper, mix, and add this dressing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One cup sweet milk</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two teaspoonfuls salt Two dashes red pepper One-half cup vinegar or juice of one lemon One tablespoonful cornstarch Two-thirds teaspoonful mustard Two eggs</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One tablespoonful butter or olive oil One-fourth teaspoonful celery salt</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sugar added improves the taste of this salad, for some. It may be varied by adding nuts or apples. This dressing is cooked; but all the vegetables in the salad are used in the raw state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">D</span><span class="font7">EFINED according to the inspired Word of God, “baptism” (from the Greek word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">baptein,</span><span class="font7"> meaning </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to dip, to dip in or under) </span><span class="font7">means 'to be buried; to be interred; to be hid away, out of sight’. It means the consecration of oneself; the full and unconditional devoting of oneself, and acceptance by the Lord. Romans 6:4 says: “We are buried with him by baptism into death.” A thing cannot be buried, interred, or hidden, by sprinkling a few drops of water upon it from some religious font.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark233"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>Israel Baptized</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Some sixteen hundred years before Christ the Hebrews, or Israelites, were sojourning in Egypt, where they were oppressed by the monarch, Pharaoh. Egypt was a type of the world, Satan’s organization; while Pharaoh was a type of the Devil, the god of this evil world. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Then Jehovah God sent His prophet, Moses, to Egypt primarily to make a name for Himself, and secondarily to redeem the Israelites. 'Wherefore thou art great, 0 Lord God: for there is none like thee, . . . And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name?” (2 Samuel 7: 22, 23) Before Moses could become the deliverer of the nation of Israel that people must agree to obey and follow Moses as the one sent of Jehovah God. Their full and unconditional agreement to follow Moses meant that they had fully committed themselves to Moses. This constituted their baptism </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">unto</span><span class="font7"> Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. When they reached the Red sea they were closely pursued by the Egyptians. God caused a cloud to stand between His people and the enemy, burying His people out of sight of the Egyptians; also, He caused the sea to divide and to stand on each side of them as they passed through to safety. By this means they were buried in the cloud and in the sea; and thus was symbolized their baptism unto Moses. Concerning this the apostle Paul wrote: “Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should he ignorant, how that all our [Hebrew] fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.”—1 Corinthians 10:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the night preceding their deliverance from Egypt the Israelites held their first passover feast, by slaying the passover lamb and feasting </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">570</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">upon it. This was according to God’s law. There Jehovah God made the law covenant by Moses as the mediator for Israel while in Egypt and at the time of the slaying of the paschal lamb. The inauguration of this law covenant took place in the season of Pentecost, or about fifty days after the Israelites were brought out of Egypt and had come to Mount Sinai (Mount Horeb). (Exodus 19:1-25; 20:1-21) At that time God made promise of the coming of One greater than Moses and of whom Moses was a type; to Moses God said: “I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth.” (Deuteronomy 18:15-19) The apostle Peter identified this Greater Prophet to come as being Christ Jesus. (Acts 3:20-23) The law was made a schoolmaster to lead Israel unto Christ, that great Deliverer. (Galatians 3:23,24) But the Jews lost confidence in the promises made by Jehovah; and when the time drew near for the coming of Jesus, the antitype of Moses, there was only a remnant in the proper heart condition to receive the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of the law covenant with the Jews was to get for Jehovah a “people for his name”; but that covenant failed because of the imperfection of the Jews. When Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, came, He was the “seed” according to Jehovah’s promise to Abraham, “the friend of God,” and those Jews who were then found faithful were transferred from Moses to Christ and thereby were made a part of the “people for his name”. The faithful disciples of Jesus Christ were striking examples of this fact. They were already consecrated to do the will of God and had been baptized into Moses “in the cloud and in the sea”, and now it was not necessary for them to again undergo baptism. Moses was the mediator for all of God’s chosen people, the nation of Israel. They “were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea”. Moses was therefore the mediator for all such and none other; hence the Jews that were found faithful at the coming of Christ Jesus were transferred from Moses to Christ. Christ was made the mediator for all such and for all Gentiles who covenant to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. . . . Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.” (Matthew 3:1-6) “John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font7"> unto] the remission of sins.” (Mark 1:4) John was announcing Jesus, the antitype of Moses, who had come to do the work that Moses could not do. The Jews had not been living up to the terms of their covenant, even to the best of their ability. They were commanded, therefore, to repent of their sins against God’s arrangement with them under the law covenant; and by being baptized they thus testified that they acknowledged their sins and repented of them, preparatory to the washing away of their sins by the blood of Christ. (Hebrews 9:14,15; Revelation 1:5) Of course, this baptism applied to the Jews only; for no other people was a party to the law covenant, and this baptism by John could apply to none other than God’s covenant people.—Acts 19:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some professing Christians have for a long time practiced and yet practice “John’s baptism”. Without doubt they do it ignorantly. One powerful religious church system practicing water immersion claims it was founded by John the Baptist. But since no Gentile or nonJew was a party to the law eovenant, and since John’s baptism was exclusively for Jews, it follows that the practicing of John’s baptism is without any avail to Gentiles at any time. The water immersion of the Jews by John only testified that they had repented of their sins and were looking to Jehovah God’s provision to wash them away. Long centuries ago God’s special favor to the Jews under the law covenant ceased because of their rejection of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sin of the world which affects all men is the sin resulting from Adam’s disobedience. (Romans 5:12) Every one of the human race has been born imperfect, and every imperfect creature before God is a sinner. The provision for the remission of such sin is only through the blood of Jesus. ‘Without shedding of blood is no remission.’’ (Hebrews 9:22) John the bap-tizer did not say that to repent and be baptized would take away </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the sin</span><span class="font7"> of the world. On the contrary, after he had practiced this baptism for six months, Jesus appeared and John pointed to Jesus and said: “Behold the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lamb of God, </span><span class="font7">which taketh away </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the sin</span><span class="font7"> of the world.” (John 1: 29) It is only by exercise of faith in the shed blood of Jesus and by the imputation of the merit of His sacrifice that the great sin of man can be taken away. It is clear, then, that mere water immersion at any time does not remit the sin and that such water immersion does not constitute real baptism.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark235"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>Real Baptism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Real baptism can therefore be understood only by understanding why Jesus was baptized. Jesus was born after the flesh a Jew; therefore in harmony with the law covenant. (Galatians 4:4, 5) He was at all times perfect and without sin. Therefore His baptism could have nothing whatsoever to do with remission of sins, for He had none. It will be observed also that He was not baptized as a babe (Luke 2: 21-39), nor as a child of twelve years of age when His parents lost Him in Jerusalem and later “found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions”. (Luke 2:41-51) Hence there could be no authority for infant immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus was about thirty years of age, being then of legal majority under the terms of God’s law covenant with Israel, He presented himself to John the baptizer to be baptized. John knew that Jesus was not a sinner; therefore he protested, saying, “I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me! And Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.”—Matthew 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to Numbers 4 those who ministered in the house of God, the Levites, were numbered from thirty years old upward. Jesus had reached that age. Immediately upon reaching that age He entered upon the performance of the work for which He had come to the earth. He came to exercise His own will in full harmony with God’s will. Therefore He gladly devoted himself to Jehovah. That constituted the consecration of himself as a perfect man to do the will of God, whatever that might be concerning Him. Here it was that He entered into a covenant with His Father. A </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">covenant</span><span class="font7"> means a solemn agreementor contract. Unconditionally giving himself to God constituted His part of entering into that covenant. That eovenant led to His death as a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Jordan river, when baptized, Jesus presented himself without spot or blemish unto God in fulfilment of the prophecy previously written concerning Him: “Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [the Bible] it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40: 7,8; Hebrews 10: 5-9) That was the “covenant with me by sacrifice” between God and Christ Jesus, since it was the will of God that He should be a sacrifice. (Psalm 50:5) There Jesus unconditionally offered himself to do whatsoever was the will of God, and it was then the will of God that Christ Jesus should be the Vindicator of His holy name and word; and that to qualify for such He must maintain His integrity toward God under the most severe test even unto an ignominious death, and that His lifeblood poured out should be and is the redemptive price for man. ‘And for this cause He is made the mediator of the new covenant.’ (Hebrews 9:15, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah God gave to Jesus the ministry of the new covenant, that is, the work of taldng out a “people for his name”; and this ministry is more excellent than that committed to Moses. (Hebrews 8: 6) When the apostles believed on the Lord Jesus as the Christ and left all to follow Him, that marked the time of their entering into a covenant by sacrifice. (Luke 18:28-30; Matthew 16:24,25) The covenant by sacrifice means to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the ransomer and, based on this faith, to exercise such faith by unconditionally agreeing to do the will of God. Three and one-half years after Jesus entered the covenant by sacrifice God made the new covenant with Him. (Matthew 26:27,28; Jeremiah 31:31-34) This seems clearly to fix the rule that no one can be taken into the new covenant until after having entered into a covenant with Jehovah by sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At His baptism in the Jordan Jesus made and began the performance of His covenant by sacrifice and which performance was finished at Calvary. Because of His covenant by sacrifice, which sacrifice was holy and acceptable unto God, Jesus is made the mediator of the new covenant. (Hebrews 8:6; 9:14,15) The new covenant is a means of providing a people to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah, and who may have a part in the vindication of His name. The mere fact that a mediator is provided shows that others would be joined with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. These “others” are those taken into the new covenant after it is made with Christ Jesus, and after they have made a covenant with Jehovah God by sacrifice and have been accepted by Jehovah as His sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the divine standpoint Jesus was counted dead </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">as a man</span><span class="font7"> from the time of His baptism in Jordan forward. There began His baptism. That real baptism was completed when He died upon the tree. As proof that it began at Jordan and progressed and ended at Calvary, we have His own words. “Can ye ... be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” He asked those w<sup>T</sup>ho requested a position of special favor in His kingdom. (Mark 10:38) Thereafter He again said: “I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !” (Luke 12: 50) The covenant He made with Jehovah at the time of the complete offering of himself at the Jordan was executory, that is, in process of being carried into effect from that time forward. That same covenant was completed on the tree at Calvary, and hence there became fully executed. God </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">counted</span><span class="font7"> His baptism as completed at the Jordan. His real baptism was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">actually</span><span class="font7"> completed when, on the tree, He cried: “It is finished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The water immersion of Jesus was an open testimony to the effect that He had entered into a covenant with Jehovah to do the Father’s will, which covenant was entered into by the full offering of himself to the Father. His being buried in the water was proof of His complete immersion into the will of His Father. His being raised out of the water testified that He had entered upon a new course of higher life and action, which the Father had provided for Him. From that time forward He was carrying out His covenant as the Father willed it. He learned His Father’s will after His immersion in Jordan. In proof of this it is recorded: ‘When Jesus was baptized, he went up straightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him.’—Matthew 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From there He went to the wilderness, where for forty days and nights He studied the Word of God, properly applying the “shadows” (types) and prophecies thereof to himself. (Matthew 4:1-11) By this means and by sweet communion with the Father He ascertained the Father’s will. To carry out His Father’s arrangement meant that He must be broken in body and must pour out His lifeblood to provide the ransom price for man and qualify as Jehovah’s vindicator. It was the completion of His covenant in actual death that He had in mind when He said: “I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !” It was finished at Calvary.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark237"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>Baptism of Footstep Followers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Addressing himself to the followers of Jesus, the apostle Peter wrote: “Even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Peter 2:21) The baptism of Christ’s disciples, therefore, must be in the same manner and for the same reason that Jesus was baptized. The apostle Paul corroborates this view when he says: “We are buried with him by baptism into death.”—Homans 6: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The real baptism for a true Christian, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is therefore, as the apostle Paul states, being buried with Christ into death, a sacrificial death. This sacrificial death takes place (so far as the man is concerned) at the time he is justified by God through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ, and is accepted for sacrifice and is begotten by the spirit of Jehovah as a son of God. Such being then taken into the new covenant to be of the “people for his name” and proving faithful thereto under test, he is baptized into Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant. “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.” (Romans 6:3-5) Paul states that the nation of Israel was baptized unto (into) Moses and that Christians are baptized into Christ. The baptism of the nation of Israel showed the full consecration of that nation to follow Moses as Jehovah’s representative and their deliverer. The baptism into Christ shows that the Christians are fully consecrated to do the will of God, following Christ Jesus as their deliverer. These are baptized into Christ’s death; that is to say, their real baptism consists in being joint-sacrificers with Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark239"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>Symbol and Necessity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Symbolic baptism, that is, baptism in water, is performed for the purpose of showing that one has made a full and unconditional consecration to do Jehovah God’s will through faith in Christ Jesus. The one who administers the water immersion for that particular purpose pictures the Lord Jehovah. The one being immersed, completely submitting himself to the administrator as Jesus did to John, illustrates how he has consecrated himself wholly, submitting himself completely to another; thus showing the complete submission to the Lord. The administrator raising the immersed one up out of the water beautifully pictures how the Lord raises up those immersed to walk in newness of life. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Complete immersion in ivater is the Scriptural symbolic baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The proper and Scriptural time to perform the symbol is within a reasonable time after one has consecrated himself to the Lord. In fact, the one who appreciates the privilege of following the Lord will give diligence to follow His course in the performance of the symbol. One inquires: “When I became a member of a denominational church I was immersed in water, which immersion I understood to be for the remission of sins. Was that immersion correct and sufficient?” The proper answer is that it was of no avail, because not performed for the Scriptural purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another says: “When I united with the Baptist church I was immersed in water. Since that organization practices the proper symbol, should I be immersed again after having come to a knowledge of the present truth?” The proper answer is: If, when immersed in the water, the one so immersed had prior thereto fully consecrated himself to Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, then there would be no necessity for repeating the symbol after coming to a knowledge of the “present truth”. (2 Peter 1:12) On the other hand, if at the time of water immersion he had not previously fully consecrated to the Lord, then the water immersion was of no value. The controlling question is, Had the person so immersed fully consecrated before the performance of the symbol? If in doubt as to that, the doubt should be resolved in one’s own favor and all doubt be removed from the mind by performing the symbol again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is there any real virtue in water immersion? There is no virtue in the water itself, but the real virtue arises from obedience to the Lord’s arrangement. If we see that Jesus was immersed in water in order to fulfil all righteousness and that He left us an example, then we see what a privilege it is to take the step He took in symbolizing the real consecration by water immersion. It would seem that if after one came to a knowledge of the reality and the purpose of the symbol such person would then fail or refuse to perform the water symbol, such a one would show a disregard of the Lord’s provisions and probably would be greatly retarded in gaining a knowledge of the truth and the great issue. ‘It is better to obey than to sacrifice.’ It is the obedience in performing the symbol when it is seen and appreciated that is really pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>Jonadab Class (2 Kings 10:15-23)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">There is today a class of people of good will toward Jehovah God and toward His witnesses, and who correspond to Jonadab the supporter of King Jehu. In a parable (Matthew 25: 31-46) Jesus pictured such class as sheep because they have endeavored to do good to the Lord Jesus by doing good unto the least of His brethren on earth today, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those of this class realize that they are not anointed with Jehovah’s spirit as His witnesses and hence are not Christians called to the heavenly calling nor taken into the covenant for the heavenly kingdom with Christ Jesus. Hence they inquire: “What can I do ?” To such question the Scriptural response is: Have you taken your stand on the side of Jehovah? If so, that means that you are trusting in the precious blood of Christ Jesus shed for the remission of sins and that you have made a consecration or agreement to do the will of Jehovah God. It would be proper for you to symbolize that agreement or consecration by water immersion in the presence of witnesses. Anyone who trusts in Jehovah and Christ Jesus could administer or perform the baptismal service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such should then diligently study the Word of God together with His provided helps that they may learn meekness and righteousness. (Zephaniah 2: 2, 3) If in their community there are others interested, so that four or five of them (or more) can get together for Bible study, that would be a good thing. The time has come when the words of Jesus are being fulfilled (Revelation 22:17): “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” The Jonadab class have heard the good news. They should then tell it to others. Let them take advantage of such opportunities and time as they have to call on other persons and tell them of the kingdom of Jehovah by Christ Jesus and of His gracious provision for the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord is now separating the “sheep” from the “goats” (the disobedient ones). This He is doing by bringing to their attention the great truths of His Word. The “sheep” must do their part to get the truth to the people. This means that you are joining no earthly organization, religious or otherwise, but that you are joining yourself to the Lord, as Jonadab did to Jehu, and are joyfully serving Him, appreciating the fact that His kingdom under Christ is the hope of the human race.—Matthew 12: 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">My dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beg to advise you on last Sunday, March 11, ’34, a Christian lady stopped at my home with literature and I was a very sick man at the time she was talking to me. Nevertheless I received two small books, one named </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance;</span><span class="font5"> and I have read and reread this book, which is very interesting to me, owing to the fact it certainly tells the Truth. When it comes to the Roman Catholic church, I can and will confirm all statements contained in this little book pertaining to Romanism. I am sorry to say I was born and raised a Roman Catholic and studied three years for a priest and lived a Catholic for almost thirty years. On July 14, 1919, at Cedar Lake, Ind., Moody Conference Grounds, under preaching of Paul Rader I found “Jesus the Christ”. Amen, it happened to me. Thank God for His power to change a man’s life; praise God for ever; I have read a great many of Judge Rutherford’s books; he certainly puts out the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the little </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font5"> book, page 40, which I now have before me, I quote or read as follows: ‘ ‘ The head of the Roman Catholic hierarchy announced that the year 1933 is a holy year, made so by his own personal declaration. . . . The Catholic press throughout the land denounced me for making that speech, and made many false statements against me. I replied in a letter addressed to them, and, they having failed to publish it, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine has published it [Thank God for that. Amen.], and each of you may have a copy of that letter, together with the speech.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now my dear good brethren, I am asking you for a copy of this letter, also copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine containing the speech, thanking you very kindly in advance for same. May God bless you all in your work. I would not part with this little book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font5"> for any set amount, say ten dollars, knowing I could not get another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have been in the Lord’s service since my conversion July 14, 1919, up to 1930, when I took sick with sugar diabetes, and have been under care of several physicians during the past five years. The last three doctors have given up my case and pronounced it incurable. So here I am, trusting for a cure from the great Physician, “Jesus the Christ,” the same yesterday, today and for ever. Amen. I believe He is able to heal and will do it when I obey and meet conditions. Praise the Lord for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have here in Wayne eounty, Ind., 124 acres of good ground, eighty tillable and forty in grass. On these forty acres the Lord is leading me to hold a big tent meeting or camp meeting. It’s ideal; has running spring water, plenty of shade and good surroundings, 4| miles from Richmond, Ind., —only a few minutes drive, good road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have no cash money, but, thank God, I have more than a plenty to eat, and a good place to sleep. If any of you happen this way, especially Judge Rutherford, please stop and see me. You will be welcome. The doors are open to you all. I am “interdenomination” always. If you have any free literature to put out I will do so prayerfully, if you will send it to me. May the love of God and peace be with you all, is my prayer for you all. Amen.</span></p>

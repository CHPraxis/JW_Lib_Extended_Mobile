<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DIVIDING THE PEOPLE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The title of this new booklet focuses attention on the work which Jehovah God, by his Judge at the temple, Christ Jesus, is now doing in view of the great slaughter to occur at Armageddon. The cover illustration is very expressive of the title and gives compelling force thereto. This booklet contains the three lectures “The True God”, “The Mimic God,” and “Why Serve Jehovah”, delivered within recent mouths over both a coast-to-coast radio network and one along the Atlantic coast, and which deserve thoughtful study by all. Like all other booklets of the Society, it may be had for 5c.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HOPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Zn </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his name shall [the] nations hope.”—Matt. 12:21, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH caused his prophet to give utterance to the words of the above text. The words are therefore Jehovah’s giving expression to his purpose, and ‘having purposed it he will also do it’. The peoples of the nations of earth need to know that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God. He has made provision for them to know. Because Jehovah’s name has been defamed he has appointed Christ Jesus the vindicator of his great and holy name. Those who refuse to hear and give heed to God’s great vindicator shall be destroyed. Those who desire to know the will and name of Jehovah God shall learn, and then obeying him they shall live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In the years next preceding this we have had emphasized the Scriptural truths that ‘they shall know that Jehovah is God’ and that the privilege of delivering the testimony of this great truth is given to Jehovah’s witnesses and for that reason these witnesses are the objects of Satan’s wrath. Jehovah’s witnesses having received his name, which he bestows upon them, have learned that his name is their high tower, and into it they run and are safe. They are not immune from persecution, but, remaining faithful to the name of Jehovah, they shall be delivered. The peoples of the nations are without hope in the world; therefore appropriate for this year is the text: “In his name shall [the] nations hope.” Having this text in mind during the year Jehovah’s witnesses will appreciate their duty and privilege in carrying such great truths to the people, even though by so doing they must endure many hardships. In this manner must they follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, their Head and Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VINDICATOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">• Jehovah God being the Creator of all things good, his name must stand for everything that is good, pure, holy, lovable and righteous. He having purposed to do a thing and having given his word as expressing that purpose, a failure to accomplish that purpose would prove that his name does not stand for everything that is good, holy, pure, righteous and all-powerful. The experience of Job discloses the question or issue raised as involving the name of Jehovah God, and the record there shows that his holy name must be completely vindicated. Satan declared before Jehovah that if God would afflict or permit affliction to come upon perfect man that man would curse God to his face, meaning necessarily that all men would in time become the enemies of God and turn against him and thus prove that no man would maintain his integrity toward God when put to the crucial test. Jehovah God accepted that challenge and permitted the test to proceed. (Job 2:4-6) Should Satan eventually prove the truth of his boastful challenge the name of Jehovah would stand for ever blemished. But if Satan fails in his boastful challenge the name of Jehovah God stands completely and for ever vindicated. Satan is doomed to complete failure. The victory is given to the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">* Adam, the first man created by the Lord God, was perfect in his organism, but he failed to maintain his integrity toward his Creator, which fact tended to prove Satan’s side of the question at issue. All of the human race descended from Adam; hence all were born in sin and, as sinners, they could have no standing before God. (Rom. 5:12) Then Jehovah made his Logos or Word a man, full of grace and truth, and caused him to dwell upon the earth amongst men. (John 1:14) Adam and Jesus were the only two perfect human creatures that have ever lived on the earth. Jesus was sent to the earth in the name of his Father, Jehovah God, which necessarily means that he was sent as the vindicator of Jehovah’s name, that is to say, to prove that the challenge made by Satan is false.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup>Jesus was a perfect man; which truth is often denied. “God sent forth his Son, made of a woman.” (Gal. 4:4) That the man Christ Jesus was perfect of necessity must be true, for several Scriptural reasons. Jesus was the direct creation of Jehovah, and “his work is perfect”. (Deut. 32:4) He was sent to be the ransomer, redeemer and savior of sinful man. (Matt. 1:25; John 3:16; 1 Tim. 2:5,6) He must therefore be a price exactly corresponding to the man Adam at the time Adam was perfect and before Adam sinned. As man’s redeemer Jesus was foreshadowed by the paschal lamb slain in Egypt, which lamb must be without blemish. (Ex. 12:5) Man is not redeemed by an imperfect thing, but “with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot”. (1 Pet. 1:19) Nothing more and nothing less than a perfect man could be the ransomer or redeemer of the human race, because God would require only the life of a perfect man. Jesus was made a little lower than the angels, a man perfect in every respect. —Heb. 2:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MADE PERFECT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* If Jesus was perfect as a man, then why is it written of him in the Scriptures that ‘he was made perfect through suffering’? (Heb. 2:10; 5:9) That scripture could not mean that he was made perfect in his organism as a man by reason of suffering, because he was already perfect. Could it mean that he was made perfect as a spirit creature ? It could not mean that; for the reason that he is Jehovah God’s creature and whatsoever God creates is perfect, and suffering could not make him more perfect. (Deut. 32:4) Does it mean that he was made perfect in character development? No; for the reason he was at all times a perfect character. Does it mean that by his sufferings he was made “perfect as a new creature”? No; because as a new creature he was never at any time imperfect, and indeed could not be.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> What, then, is meant by the scripture, ‘ ‘ Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. 5:8,9) Jehovah God sent his beloved Son to earth as the vindicator of his (Jehovah’s) name. The issue or question for determination was: Could, a perfect man be subjected to all manner of afflictions and sufferings and maintain his integrity toward God? Satan said he could not. God’s word and name declared exactly the contrary. In order to prove the name of Jehovah, the perfect man Jesus must be subjected to the assaults and sufferings that Satan would inflict upon him. If he came through the fire of affliction unscathed and victorious, that would prove Satan a liar and Jehovah right. It was Satan who tempted Jesus at the beginning of his ministry and thereby attempted to bring about his self-destruction. Failing in that, then Satan caused Jesus to be persecuted in every conceivable manner. Truly “he was oppressed, and he was afflicted”. God did not afflict his own dearly beloved Son; “yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him . . . [and] put him to grief.”—Isa. 53:7-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Why would it thus please Jehovah to have his Son put to grief? God permitted his Son to thus be bruised and afflicted because it was necessary in order to settle the question at issue raised by the boastful challenge of Satan. There never was a time that Jesus was disobedient to his Father, but he must suffer in order to learn obedience under </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">suffering</span><span class="font3"> and thus prove that under suffering he would be obedient. Therefore in all of his sufferings Jesus learned obedience and steadfastly maintained his integrity toward Jehovah God. The final suffering came when Jesus knew that he was to die the ignominious death of a sinner. Jesus did not fear death, but because his Father’s name was involved he did fear that, dying like a sinner, he would thus defame his Father’s name, because the Devil would appear to triumph. For that reason Jesus in Gethsemane cried out: “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done.” (Luke 22:42) That time of suffering is the same referred to by the apostle who wrote: “Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared.” (Heb. 5:7) The Scriptural proof is conclusive that Jehovah at that time gave Jesus assurance that his death as a sinner would not be a reproach to the name of Jehovah but that eventually Jehovah would use that very thing to the vindication of his name. ‘ ‘ And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.” (Luke 22:43) Thereafter Jesus exhibited no fear whatsoever, which shows that it was not death that he feared, but that his agony was because of the apparent triumph of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The meaning of the scripture above quoted concerning Jesus’ being made perfect by suffering manifestly is this: As the Son of God he was perfect, but as a Son who was at all times obedient to his Father he had not suffered and there was no occasion for him to suffer. He was made a perfect man, and now Jehovah would have him prove that a perfect man can be subjected to all manner of suffering and still maintain his integrity toward God, and, this being done, such would prove Satan to be a liar and would be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus must therefore go through all manner of suffering, and through it all he was obedient to his Father; hence ‘he learned obedience by the things which he suffered’. Whether he suffered or did not suffer he was always obedient; but if he had not suffered there would have been no proof that he would be obedient under suffering. His constant obedience under the most terrible suffering proved Satan’s boastful challenge absolutely false, and hence was the vindication of Jehovah. The word in this text above quoted, and which is rendered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">make perfect,</span><span class="font3"> is also rendered to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">complete, accomplish, finish, </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fulfil.</span><span class="font3"> By remaining steadfast throughout his period of suffering Jesus did completely accomplish and fulfil his Father’s side of the question at issue, and this he did by being obedient to his Father under the severe test.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> What was Jehovah’s purpose in thus having his beloved Son ‘made perfect through suffering’? The answer is, to prove that Satan is a liar, and that his challenge is without foundation, and that Jehovah God is right and always righteous, and that the one gaining the victory over Satan under the test would prove his qualification to be the redeemer of man and the leader of all obedient creation back to the Father, and the one whom Jehovah would use to destroy the Devil. Therefore says the apostle: “And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. ’ ’—Heb. 5: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> It was necessary for Jesus to be a human creature of flesh and blood like other men and, as a man meeting the terms of the question at issue, to prove his qualification to be the one whom Jehovah would use to destroy the Devil and all of his wicked organization. In support of this conclusion, it is written: “Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.” —Heb. 2:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Jesus by his triumph in this contest becomes the vindicator of Jehovah’s name and the executioner appointed by Jehovah to destroy the enemy. The resurrection of Jesus proved that Jesus had been faithful and true to Jehovah, had maintained his integrity as a man, and therefore as a perfect man he had fully and completely met the contest and vindicated his Father’s name. This proves Satan’s boastful challenge to be an empty thing. Jesus not only becomes the redeemer of mankind, but becomes the vindicator of his Father’s name and the leader and commander of all peoples, and all who live must obey him; and this is a further vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah therefore commands that all creation shall bow before the name of Christ Jesus. “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:9-11) The suffering of Jesus therefore had nothing whatsoever to do with making him perfect as a man, or perfect as a new creature divine, or perfect in character development, but by his suffering he did prove fully and completely that a perfect man can, under the most severe test and suffering, remain true, obedient and steadfastly devoted to Jehovah God. Only those who suffer in like manner, and who in like manner prove their integrity toward God, will be permitted to be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. (2 Tim. 2:12) That the suffering of Christ and his true followers is a privilege enabling them to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name is further supported by the following texts: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2:21) “Because to you it was graciously given on behalf of Christ, not only to believe into him, but also to suffer on his account.”—Phil. 1:29, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Having proved his Father’s side of the great issue by reason of his faithfulness even unto the ignominious death, Jesus, when he was raised up out of death and ascended on high, was ready to proceed with the work of destroying the enemy, if such was the will of his Father. That was a part of the work he was commissioned to do. This is proved by the statement: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:1,2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font3"> Heb. 10:12,13) Jesus must await Jehovah’s due time to destroy the enemy and his organization. During that period of waiting two important things would come to pass, to wit: (1) Jehovah would permit the Devil to remain and continue his efforts to prove his side of the question at issue and to practice all kinds of fraud, deceit and oppression, particularly by and through fraudulent religion; and (2) Jehovah would take out from amongst imperfect men a company to be associated with Christ Jesus, who must prove their integrity to Jehovah and be made the associates of Jesus in Zion, and who must declare the name of Jehovah throughout the earth, and thus further prove Satan as a liar and a fraud: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lees.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah puts his own name upon his beloved Son and commands that all creation must worship him. Why would he do that? It is the name of Jehovah that is involved, and now his beloved Son having been appointed to the office of vindicator and executioner, he bears the name of his Father. Jehovah honors him above any and all others. Jehovah puts his spirit upon his beloved Son, and the Father and Son are one, that is to say,, in complete unity for the accomplishment of Jehovah’s purpose. The Father is Master, and Christ Jesus, his Son, is the servant, hence subject to Jehovah. “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles [nations].” (Isa. 42:1) “Christ” means the anointed One of Jehovah; which means that Jehovah has commissioned this mighty One to carry out his purposes and particularly the vindication of his name. Concerning his anointed One Jehovah says: “I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another [than Christ], neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isa. 42:8, A..R.V.) No creature aside from Jehovah’s anointed can ever have the honor of bearing his name. Images or organizations that parade in the name of God and of Christ are not permitted to share in that honor. Those who have this honor conferred upon them must prove their integrity to Jehovah God, and it is limited to Christ Jesus and the members of his body.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> During the waiting period of 1800 years and more Jehovah has been gathering out from amongst human creatures those who have signified their desire to be the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. In that period of time millions of persons have professed to be followers of Christ Jesus, but the Devil has blinded most of them by his divers and numerous fraudulent methods. Most of those professed ones have understood that Jehovah was trying to get them into heaven so that the Devil could not get all the human race into hell. Such a conclusion is entirely foreign to Jehovah’s purpose. Many persons have heard the truth in recent years and responded thereto, but only a small number, comparatively speaking, have been chosen. Satan has turned millions of professed followers of Christ Jesus away from God, and God has at no time tried to prevent him from so doing. Those who worship God must do so in spirit, sincerity and truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> What God has been doing during the waiting period is to ‘take out from the nations a people for his name’. (Acts 15:14) This people taken out and approved by Jehovah must bear his name. Since Jehovah confers this honor on none aside from his anointed, it follows that all thus taken out must follow the Lord Jesus not only for a time, but to the end, and that they must prove their integrity, must become members of God’s organization of which the anointed Christ Jesus is the Head, and must bear testimony to the name of Jehovah faithfully unto the end. To take men and women to heaven would be no honor to Jehovah’s name; but to select out from amongst fallen men 144,000 who would prove their integrity and unswerving devotion to Jehovah God even unto death is a vindication of his name, because such further proves the Devil’s boastful challenge is wickedly false. The anointed servant of the Most High is composed of Christ Jesus and 144,000 who are made the associates of Christ Jesus. All of these must through suffering learn obedience and prove their faithfulness unto God. They must all be brought to unity and made one in Christ, even as God and Christ Jesus are one. (John 17: 21) The 144,000 company must be brought into absolute unity and participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Eph. 4:11-14) Such unity means perfect and harmonious action as members of God’s organization to vindicate his name. This unity is accomplished when Christ Jesus comes to the temple, builds up Zion, and puts the entire organization into harmonious action under his direct supervision. The waiting period named in the Psalm ended in 1914, and then Jehovah sent forth his beloved Son to rule, and he comes to his temple and gathers the approved ones, because the time has arrived for the vindication of Jehovah’s great name. —Ps. 110:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>ir</sup>In the year text the term “nations” means the peoples throughout the earth. (Matt. 12:21) Many millions of these profess to be followers of Christ Jesus, and yet most of them are without hope because they are ignorant of Jehovah’s purpose. After centuries of operation of a religious system called “organized Christianity” the peoples of “Christendom” are hopeless. Divers and numerous schemes formulated by men and man-made organizations have been placed before the people and which schemes have promised the people relief and blessings. The people have feared their men leaders and have trusted in them, and for that reason have been led into the snare of the enemy. They have failed to trust in God and in his Word. “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29:25) Selfish men have made and promulgated these various schemes, and the invisible ruler, Satan the Devil, has overreached the men of the world and hence led the whole world into his snare. The nations of the earth are therefore under the domination of that wicked one, the Devil. (1 John 5:19) Only those who have trusted in the Lord and who faithfully serve him have escaped the snares of the wicked one. (Ps. 119:110; 2 Tim. 2:26) Satan by and through his various worldly agencies has blinded the people to the truth of God’s purpose. In times past the people had hope in the schemes of men, but now those schemes have all failed and the people are sad and distressed. (Prov. 13:12) No person can have a substantial hope who is without knowledge of God and his kingdom. The only hope for the nations of the earth is the name of Jehovah and his Christ, because it is the kingdom under Christ that will vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring relief to mankind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>18</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has stated that the clergy of “organized Christianity” serve the Devil and do not serve Jehovah God. This statement has been vigorously challenged, the contention being that there are sincere ministers who preach and who are preaching the gospel as they believe it. The answer thereto is that sincerity in belief does not make one a servant of Jehovah God. Let it be conceded that there are sincere men in the ministry of so-called “organized Christianity”. It must also be conceded by those who defend them that such ministers preach doctrines that are selfish. Even those who preach that the salvation of man comes by and through the blood of Christ Jesus tell the people that Jehovah’s purpose is to save men and take them to heaven in order to prevent the Devil from getting all mankind. Such a conclusion not only is erroneous, but is extremely selfish and results from deception practiced upon men by Satan, and thus such men are made to serve the Devil, regardless of whether they are sincere or not.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">They are the servants of him whom they serve. (Rom. 6:16) The clergy of “organized Christianity” never tell the people that there will be but a small number to go to heaven, and that the most that are saved will find restitution blessings under the kingdom of God on earth. They never tell the people about the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through his King, Christ Jesus, and that their hope rests in faithfulness to God and his kingdom. They do not tell the people these things, because they do not believe them. They tell the people, probably in all sincerity, that God sends afflictions upon them because of their indifference to their church obligations, which is not only erroneous, but a defamation of God’s holy name, and serves the Devil. The preaching of error, even though done in all sincerity, tends to turn the people away from Jehovah God and thus makes the preacher of such error a servant of Satan. In order for the people to have hope, they must know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LEADER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The greatest of all questions for determination is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. All other matters are subsidiary thereto. The salvation of the human race or any portion thereof will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name and prove his supremacy, but the salvation of the human race is not the important thing. Jehovah could wipe out the entire race and make a new one, and in so doing he would in no wise violate justice. On the other hand, by placing the truth before his creatures and giving life everlasting to those who willingly obey him, such is a vindication of his name and results beneficially to the creature that obeys. When the wicked are destroyed, and those who love God and are obedient are given life, such proves that Jehovah alone is the Supreme One and worthy of all worship and joyful service. That will settle for ever the question of supremacy, and then all creation will see that only the obedient ones are given life everlasting by the Most High. Thus is magnified the name of Jehovah’s anointed King, through whose name he brings vindication and the hope of life to the obedient ones of creatures.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah made Christ Jesus his servant or anointed one to vindicate his name. He appointed Jesus as leader of all who will ever get life. Therefore it is written by his prophet: ‘ ‘ Incline your car, and come unto me; hear [obey], and your soul shall live; . . . Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isa. 55: 3, 4) Those who faithfully and successfully follow the leader must have faith and confidence in the leader’ and must obey his commandments. They must do as the leader does; and since Christ Jesus maintained his integrity toward Jehovah God, others who live must do likewise. He leads first those whom he associates with him in his kingdom, and afterwards all that get life everlasting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah sent his beloved Son to earth to bear testimony to the truth, and everyone who maintains his integrity toward God must hear and obey the truth as declared by Christ Jesus. (John 18:37) Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus takes out from amongst men a people for his name. Now, as the great vindicator of Jehovah’s name, Christ Jesus commands these taken-out ones to ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom as a witness to the nations’. (Matt. 24:14) This means that they must obey this commandment in order to maintain their integrity towards Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARING THE HONOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah having taken out from amongst the nations a people for his name and having now brought them unto Zion and built them up into his organization, he bestows upon them as members of The Christ his own great name. This is the honor or glory which no others are permitted to have. “And the Gentiles [nations] shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” (Isa. 62: 2) As Christ Jesus is the great witness of Jehovah, likewise all those who are brought into unity with him, and upon whom the new name is bestowed, must be witnesses to the name of God and Christ; hence Jehovah says to them: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God,” that is to say, the Supreme One, and besides whom there is no other. (Isa. 43:10-12) Jehovah committed to Christ Jesus the testimony of his purpose to vindicate his name, and all those who are brought into unity with Christ have in turn committed to them the privilege, duty and obligation of bearing witness to that great name. (Rev. 12:17) Christ Jesus is therefore the great leader and great witness to all those who are now in Zion, and those who continue therein must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah God and to his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPREMACY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The question of supremacy must now be for ever settled, because it is Jehovah’s due time to settle it. He has assembled Zion and made his taken-out people a part thereof, and to them he says: “1 am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. . . . Fear ye not, neither be afraid; have not I told thee from that time, and have [I not] declared it? ye are even my witnesses.” (Isa. 44:6-8) Jehovah’s anointed, therefore, must fully trust him and fearlessly declare his name. The time approaches now when Jehovah will give opportunity to the people to determine in whom they will trust and whom they will serve. Because he has made Christ Jesus his vindicator Jehovah now speaks to his great Servant and Witness, saying: “Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein; I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the [nations]; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.” (Isa. 42:5-7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> This scripture does not say that Christ Jesus is commissioned to take the people to heaven, but it does say that he is commissioned to open their blind eyes and inform them of the truth, that they may have an opportunity to choose whom they will serve. Those who believe upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer and the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, have reason for a hope. They must then be obedient to Jehovah, the Supreme One. Every one who maintains his integrity toward God, to that extent, therefore, will prove Satan to be a liar and hence have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> When Jesus had endured much suffering and thereby continued to be obedient unto his Father he was made the vindicator of his Father’s name. For that reason Jehovah made Christ Jesus his “right hand” and his “holy arm” to accomplish his purpose of proving his own great supremacy. It is Jehovah, therefore, who gains the victory over his enemies; but he gets this victory by and through his beloved Son as his instrument, and he makes his Son this instrument or vindicator because the Son was obedient under suffering. In harmony with this Jehovah caused to be written by his prophet: “ 0 sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things; his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his salvation; his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the [nations].” (Ps. 98:1,2) It is Jehovah who saves the obedient ones and gives them everlasting life, and this he does for his own great name’s sake. Their salvation is a vindication of his name, and this vindication operates beneficially to everyone who proves his integrity toward God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DESIRE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” All reasonably sane persons desire to have life and to dwell in peace and to enjoy the things which God has provided for them. No human creature can realize such desired blessings until he learns whence they come and what he must do to obtain them. Jehovah God sent his beloved Son to earth that man might believe in him and live and not perish. (John 3:16) That means that without knowledge and without belief mankind must perish. The life of the perfect man Jesus provided the redemptive price for man, but in order for man to reap the benefits thereof he must know Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and choose to be obedient to the righteous laws of his kingdom. “Where there is no vision [knowledge and understanding] , the people perish; but he that kcepeth the law, happy is he.” (Prov. 29:18) Hence it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Jehovah has made provision for the people to learn, and he lays the privilege and obligation upon his witnesses to now declare to them that their hope is in his kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> The crisis is here when the paramount question must be settled. Satan is exercising all his power in his efforts to win, but he is certain to lose. Satan would destroy all the people rather than see any of them serve God. Satan continues to oppress and increase the burdens of the people, and this drives them to desperation. (Rev. 12:12) The rulers in their efforts to pull the world out of the mire continue to lay greater burdens upon the people. There is absolutely nothing in this world upon which the people can hope; hence the nations are in despair.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Standing out boldly in contrast to the miserable condition of the world is Jehovah God’s gracious provision for obedient mankind. He has made Christ Jesus his vindicator and has placed the name of Christ above every name save that of his alone, and he calls upon the people to hear his great King and to learn the importance of his name. The remnant of the elect company yet on earth are made the witnesses of Jehovah, and they are commanded to point the people of good will to Jehovah’s kingdom and his great King. The name of Christ Jesus stands for the kingdom of Jehovah, which will vindicate Jehovah’s name, and “in his name shall [the] nations hope”, and there is no other name in which they can hope or whereby they can possibly be saved. (Acts 4:12) Jehovah’s witnesses must therefore point the people to this one and only and complete hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Is it to be expected that Jehovah’s witnesses can give testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom without being subjected to persecution and suffering? Certainly not! The Devil piled persecutions upon Jesus in an effort to prove his side of the question at issue and to prevent the giving of testimony by Jesus concerning God and his kingdom. Amidst great sufferings Jesus continued to the end to bear testimony to the truth and to maintain his integrity and to thus prove God to be true. Those who are associated with him, and particularly the remnant now on earth, must likewise suffer at the hands of Satan, because they are bearing the testimony of Christ Jesus the great King. At the same time they must maintain their integrity by learning obedience by and through the things which they must suffer. “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) But there is a real joy in tribulation when we know that the tribulation is heaped upon us because we are doing right in obedience to God’s commandments and if we continue faithful unto the end we shall prove our integrity and thus have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. That is the reason Jesus invites his faithful ones to ‘enter into the joy of thy Lord’, meaning the joy of participating in the vindication of his Father’s name. (Matt. 25:21) For the same reason the apostle wrote: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font3">am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.” (2 Cor. 7:4) As Jehovah’s witnesses go forth and with boldness declare the name of Jehovah God and his King and kingdom it is to be expected that persecutions and sufferings will be their lot. Those who willingly persecute Jehovah’s witnesses and oppose God’s kingdom are now marking themselves for the slaughter that shall come at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. They are putting on their garments of identification; and the people of good will must be told that their only hope is in the name of Jehovah God’s great vindicator and they must identify themselves as being on his side. In due time Jehovah will go forth to fight for his own people, and thus he will vindicate his witnesses who have faithfully maintained their integrity toward him in proclaiming his name and the name of his King.—Zech. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">14:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The testimony now being given by Jehovah’s witnesses is not for the purpose of converting the world. The whole world lies in the wicked one, and all these walk on in darkness, except those persons who have a desire to escape from the wicked one and take refuge in the kingdom of God’s dear Son. Such must now be told the truth, that they may have hope in his name. The testimony must continue to be given until the organization of Satan is “wasted without inhabitant”. (Isa. 6:9-11) Truly this is a great and glorious time. It is a time of great distress amongst the nations and peoples of the earth, and a time of great opposition to the truth, and a time of great joy to those who are privileged to bear the name of Jehovah and his beloved Son and to tell the people what is their only hope. Those now devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom will not permit tribulation to discourage them. We should be in doubt about the understanding of the prophecies if there were not opposition to and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses now. “Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.” (Ps. 91: 9-11) “In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.”—Ps. 89:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> From the Scriptures and the physical facts we know that we are right and if we continue faithful to the end we shall triumph in Christ and have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> Summing up the matter, it is seen that the name of Jehovah, the Most High, is involved; that in order </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to clear </span><span class="font3">his name and prove to all creation that Satan </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font3">liar, Jehovah God must put on earth a perfect man who can and will remain true and steadfastly faithful even under the most severe and crucial suffering; that Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth, made him a perfect man, and permitted him to be subjected to great sufferings in order that by the things which he suffered Jesus could prove Jehovah’s side of the question at issue and that by his faithfulness under such sufferings Jesus could establish his qualification to be the savior and redeemer of man, the executioner of the Devil, and the vindicator of Jehovah’s great name. In the exercise of his loving-kindness and as further proof that Satan is a liar Jehovah God selects a company of 144,000 human creatures from amongst imperfect men, all of whom must suffer as Christ suffered, and likewise maintain their integrity unto God, and for so doing Jehovah graciously gives them a part with Christ Jesus in the vindication of his name. No one can obtain everlasting life except by Jehovah, and they must believe on the name of Christ Jesus, and obey him, in order to receive life, because Jehovah has made this provision. The peoples of the nations of the earth must be told to whom they can look for hope. Therefore God commands his witnesses to tell the people that in the name of Christ Jesus, the vindicator of Jehovah and the Savior of the world, they shall hope. Blessed is the privilege of those who have part in keeping these commandments of Jehovah and pointing the people to the King of kings.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INCREASE OF HIS GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3"> RIGHTEOUS government on earth, administered for the general welfare of the people, has for centuries been the desire of honest persons. In obedience to the commandment of Jesus Christ his faithful followers for nineteen centuries have prayed for the coming of such a government that the will of God might be done on earth even as it is done in heaven. Centuries before the coming of Jesus to earth men who believed in and served Jehovah God looked forward with confidence to the time when there would be a righteous rule on the earth. Their hope was based upon the promise Jehovah made to Abraham, the father of the faithful, that he would in due time raise up a seed that would rule the world in righteousness and by and through which seed all the families and nations of the earth shall have an opportunity for lasting blessings.—Gen. 22:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth to give testimony of and concerning the purpose of God and to redeem the human race. It was in the year (A.D.) 33 that Jesus Christ began his ministry, preaching to his hearers: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand’’; meaning that Jesus himself was God’s anointed King and had begun his work amongst men according to the will of the Most High. Jesus gathered round him faithful men and taught them and used them as witnesses for Jehovah. He strongly impressed upon their minds the fact that he must die and be raised from the dead in order that mankind might have the opportunity to live, and that he must go away to heaven and receive from Jehovah the authority for his kingdom or rule of the world. He further informed his disciples that in God’s due time he, Jesus, would come again and receive unto himself those whom he found faithful and that then he would begin his reign as the world’s ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Portions of the Bible were written by the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ, and this they did under the inspiration and direction of the holy spirit. That which, in the writings of the apostles, is emphasized above all things else is the fact that Christ Jesus the King shall come again and establish Jehovah God’s kingdom and carry out the purposes of the Most High, that the peoples of earth may be blessed. It was the apostle Paul who identified Christ Jesus as the seed of Abraham according to the promise which Jehovah made to Abraham long centuries ago. (Gal. 3:16-29) Thus the promises of Jehovah set forth in the Old Testament are directly connected with the truths in the New Testament, and this proves that the Old Testament and the New Testament constitute the &quot;Word of God given to man for his direction in the course of righteousness and that it is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostles were informed that from the time of the resurrection of Christ Jesus and his ascension into heaven until his coming again to set up the kingdom or government would be a long period, during which men must wait. What was to be done in that long interval of waiting? The apostles and other men of mature mind met together at Jerusalem to consider this very matter. (Acts 15:6) They knew that God had dealt with the Jews as his chosen people and that because of unfaithfulness of the majority of that people God had removed his favor from them as a nation, but that his favor still continued toward the faithful individuals of that nation. They also saw that honest seekers for the truth who were not Jews were receiving God’s favor. Some of these faithful men at the convention above mentioned made known to their brethren that ‘God had wrought miracles among the Gentiles [nations] ’ by giving them the truth. The Lord had especially directed Peter to take the gospel to Cornelius and other Gentiles. (Acts 10: 1-48) Thus they discerned that God was no respecter of persons but now opportunity should be given to non-Jews to become followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostles then considered the words of the prophecy of Jehovah, spoken by Amos, which disclosed Jehovah’s purpose to take out from the nations a people to be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom and that in due time Christ Jesus would come again, receive these faithful ones to himself, and set up his righteous government, which government or kingdom was foreshadowed by the reign of King David. (Acts 15:14-18; Amos 9:11,12) The Lord therefore revealed to the apostles that the long period of time of waiting, from the exaltation of Christ Jesus to heaven to the time of his coming again, would be employed in teaching or preaching to the people of and concerning the Kingdom; and this the apostles proceeded to do. This preaching of the gospel has been for the purpose of bearing witness to Jehovah’s kingdom and for the taking out a people for his name. All those persons so selected from the world and who continue faithful to God and Christ Jesus must bear witness to the truth. (John 18:37) The apostles stressed the fact that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus would look with eagerness for the coming of the Lord again and that those who remained faithful and true to God would love the appearing of Christ Jesus, and that such would then receive their reward, to wit, the crown of life, that is, the highest element of life. That would mean that such faithful ones would be made a part of the Kingdom or righteous government.—2 Tim. 4:7,8; Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With these great truths ever before those who love and serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesus it can readily be seen that such faithful ones would eagerly look for the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. It was about the year 1872 (A.D.) that a small company of earnest and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, while studying the Scriptures and comparing these with events coming to pass, saw evidence that the Lord was giving special attention to those on earth, and that the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom was imminent. This little company of faithful Christians continued to grow in numbers and in knowledge of the precious things which are found in the Word of God. Shortly thereafter they formed themselves into a Society for more systematic study and teaching of the Word of God. Living on earth and in a nation that has laws for the holding and control of property, both real and personal, and desiring that their organization should perpetuate its work and activity without depending upon the earthly existence of any particular person, this little company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus decided to form a corporation, which corporation should have the management and control of the property and holdings and direct the activities of those who would continue faithful to God and who were looking for his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the year 1884 these followers of Christ Jesus formed a corporation under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, which was then given the name Zion’s Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. The word “Zion” is one of the names which Jehovah God has given his capital organization and frequently appears in the Bible. The word “Zion” appearing in the corporate name had no reference to or connection with the Jewish organization which is called “Zionism”. Afterwards the name of the above-mentioned corporation was, by the law of the State of Pennsylvania and order of court, changed to that of Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society; and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth have continued that name of their corporation to this day. At no time has any Jew been connected with or supported the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Merely for convenience and to comply with the laws of the land, and to further the interest of its work, the Society organized the Peoples Pulpit Association, in 1909, under the membership corporation law of the State of New York. For the same reason the International Bible Students Association was organized, in 1914, under the laws of Great Britain. These three corporations are really one, and they are all directed by the same officers and have possession and control of the property of the Society. By the word “Society” is meant the united company of faithful men and women now on earth who are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ and who are, by His grace, carrying forward the work of the Lord in the earth. No one of these three corporations above named has any capital stock. They pay no dividends to any person, and no person receives any pecuniary profit therefrom. They are wholly and entirely devoted to carrying forward the work of the Society, which is the preaching or making known to the people the good news that Jehovah’s time is at hand for the establishment of his kingdom under Christ, and the truths kindred thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These statements of fact are here made for the information of any and all honest persons who desire to know what is the purpose of the Society and the corporations that carry forward its work. Misinformed persons, who have been misled and deceived by the willful enemy of God and his kingdom, have been induced to believe that the Society and the corporations above mentioned are selfish, political organizations, operating in connection with other selfish, political organizations for the overthrow of present governments. Such wicked falsehoods proceed from the Devil, who at all times has opposed every one who serves Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In every country of the world where there is an anti-Jewish sentiment the malicious falsehood is circulated among the people that our Society and its corporations are financed by commercial Jews. That is also a malicious lie originating with Satan and carried forward by his earthly representatives. In countries where socialism and communism are threatened the enemies charge the Society and its supporters with being in league with socialists and communists for the overthrow of the government; which is also a malicious lie emanating from Satan and carried forward by his earthly representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This Society and the three corporations named herein have at all times kept completely separate and apart from all political parties or affiliations. We have no part in the political affairs of this world, for the reason that our devotion is absolutely and completely to God and his kingdom under Christ, for which kingdom faithful men and women have been hoping and praying for the past nineteen hundred years. It would be foolish and contrary to God’s will for us to participate in or be associated with any political organization. Our Society and its corporations have never received one cent of financial support from Jews. From the very beginning of the Society until the present day its money to carry forward its work has come from contributions made by humble men and women who have a desire to make known the truth of and concerning Jehovah God’s provision for the blessings of the peoples of the earth. The work of the Society is done according to the will of Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and he puts in the hearts of faithful men and women the desire to supply the money to carry forward his work. All the money and all the property of the earth belong to him, and he can see to it, and does see to it, that the money which is necessary is supplied for his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who love God, and who believe and rely upon his Word as set forth in the Bible, plainly sec and clearly understand that Satan the Devil is the arch enemy of God and the opposer of all true followers of Christ Jesus. It was Satan the Devil who at the very beginning of human history challenged Jehovah God to put on earth men who would remain faithful and true to God. Satan declared his ability to cause all men to curse God and turn away from him. That raised the issue, which Jehovah accepted, and he has permitted or suffered Satan to do all within his power to make proof of his wicked challenge, Jehovah biding his own due time to vindicate his great name and to completely destroy Satan and his wicked organization. The great time of climax has arrived, and hence the strenuous witness in the earth and the opposition thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To carry out his wicked challenge Satan commercialized the human race and has caused his agents on earth to deal in human flesh and blood. He is the one who put in the mind of man the greedy love for money, or the things that bring personal gain, and by which men have builded among the nations a tremendous commercial organization that at all times has been oppressive and injurious to the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a part of his commercial scheme, and as another means of defaming Jehovah’s name and of turning men away from the true God, Satan early in the history of man organized religion, and since then every religion practiced on earth has been used by Satan to defame the name of Jehovah God. “Religion,” as that word is properly used, means an outward form of worship which gives honor to men and to an unseen power. Many honest people believe that they are worshiping God, when in fact they are being misled by the Devil to defame God’s holy name. Some parts of the Bible are used by the clergy to support religions, and this affords another means of deceiving the people. All religions have indulged in the politics of this world, which is contrary to the Word of God. —James 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True Christianity means the faithful following by men in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, the Anointed of God. (1 Pet. 2:21) That means entire devotion to Jehovah God, and not to any man or to any worldly organization directed by man. It means that the true Christians or followers of Christ Jesus must be witnesses to the majesty and supremacy of Jehovah God and bear testimony to the truth of God’s Word. (John 18: 37) In order to give testimony of the truth it is necessary for one to study and to understand the Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, which is the truth. —John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Organized Christian religionists” have entirely overlooked the Scriptural meaning of the second coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. The Bible testimony is all one way, to wit, that the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom is to vindicate Jehovah’s name by proving that Jehovah is the supreme and true God, that he is the God of wisdom, justice, love and power, and from whom all life and blessings flow. The Bible testimony further is that the kingdom of God under Christ is a righteous government, which kingdom or government will vindicate Jehovah’s name and is the only hope of the peoples of the world. In this year of 1934, when the nations and peoples all over the earth are in great distress and perplexity, “organized Christian religionists” entirely ignore the Scriptural testimony as to the cause of this trouble, and how the world can be brought out of this depression, and in the place and stead of the Scriptures they follow the theories of men and join in all man-made schemes to relieve mankind. These religionists not only entirely ignore the cause of the trouble, but appear to be entirely blind to the divine remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy and the politicians pose before the people as followers of Christ and by word of mouth say, “We implicitly believe in divine guidance, ’ ’ and at the same time entirely ignore the Word of the divine God, who is Jehovah the Most High. No one who is truly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom can have any part in the political affairs of this world. If these men, as they say, did implicitly believe and trust in the divine God, then they would follow his Word and would see that the great climax of trouble and wickedness is now upon the earth because of Satan, and that soon God will destroy this wicked organization, and in its place there shall follow a rule of complete righteousness; and they would teach the people these truths, and inform them that the kingdom of God alone will bring relief and blessings. Any persons who would join forces with socialists or communists or any other political organization in this day would thereby furnish the conclusive proof that they are not the servants of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At all times opposition to the truth has originated with and proceeded from the Devil, and “religionists” have been the chief instruments of the Devil used to carry forward this opposition on earth. At the very beginning of the ministry of Christ Jesus the Devil tried to cause the destruction of Jesus. (Matt. 4:1-11) Jesus was constantly persecuted by the religious leaders, the clergy of his time, and the proof in the divine Word is that such religionists, the clergymen, were the agents of the Devil. Those religionists claimed to be the representatives of God, but to them Jesus said: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of Iris own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:40-44) Why has opposition to the Lord Jesus and his kingdom always been manifest ? Because the Devil had sworn to turn all men away from Jehovah God and he has taken every opportunity to oppose God and his servants. When Jesus came to earth as the special witness of Jehovah and to redeem the human race, and to begin the work of taking out from the nations a people to be witnesses to Jehovah, the Devil wickedly opposed every part of his work. In this opposition the Devil used his earthly agents, to wit, the religionists of that time, and he has continued to use such men ever since. Jesus plainly told his true followers that they would receive like persecution from the same source of religionists.—Matt. 10:24,25; John 15: 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is therefore certainly to be expected that the witnesses of Jehovah, that is to say, the true followers of Christ Jesus who would be looking for the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom and testifying thereto, would be the objects of the Devil’s wrath and of his cruel opposition. Jesus told his faithful followers that they would be hated of all nations at that time for his name’s sake; and the facts that have come to pass in recent years completely prove the fulfilment of this prophecy. (Matt. 24:9) To his faithful followers Christ Jesus committed the work of giving testimony to the truth, and told them that they would be wickedly persecuted by the Devil and his earthly representatives; and it is even so to this day.—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SEDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The false charge of sedition and blasphemy was made against Jesus by the religionists, and he was wrongfully and without any true evidence convicted of that crime and put to death. The clergy who were his persecutors were the very ones who tried to destroy the evidence of his resurrection, and in that it is manifest that they were the instruments of the Devil. (Matt. 27: 62-66) It is certain, therefore, that the second coming of Christ and his kingdom would be violently opposed by the Devil and his agents, even as we see it going on at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Organized Christian religion” had its origin in the day of Constantine, the emperor of Rome. Then it was that the Roman Catholic hierarchy came into existence. From that time to the present day the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been the most powerful religious organization on earth and also the chief instrument of the Devil in opposition to the kingdom of God under Christ. It not only practices religion, but is a powerful commercial organization and a cruel political organization. Its opposition to truth has been and is subtle and deceptive, and thereby many honest persons have been deceived. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has always appeared before the people as a representative of God and of Christ, and yet at the same time has been the chief instrument for the persecution of all who have told the truth concerning God’s Word. It has tried to keep the people in complete ignorance of the Bible and has induced them to follow, instead of the Scriptures, the teachings of the Papal “religious organization”. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has at all times indulged in politics and tried to control the nations of the world. It has collected fabulous sums of money from the people to carry on its works. All true witnesses for the Lord have been classed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy as bigots, blasphemers and enemies of the state, and the charge of sedition and blasphemy is often laid against the humble followers of Christ Jesus. Such wicked opposition to the truth, and such persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, are made manifest today, particularly in the countries of Italy, Germany, Canada and the United States, and that persecution is led by the religionists of so-called “organized Christianity”, the chief instrument of Satan on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a time when ministers of the Protestant religious organization opposed the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and called attention to its ungodliness, but in modern times the so-called “Protestant religionists” have abandoned the “protest theory” and joined forces with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and both organizations are in opposition to God and his kingdom under Christ. These opposers of God’s kingdom under Christ, in an effort to hide their own crookedness, falsely charge the faithful followers of Christ Jesus with the crime of sedition and blasphemy. Such opposers constantly indulge in a campaign of circulating slanderous and libelous reports to the effect that Jehovah’s witnesses are violators of the commercial laws of the land and are allied with communists to overthrow the government. All reasonable persons can readily see that such opposition and persecution originate and proceed from the Devil and therefore “organized religionists and religions” are instruments and servants of the Devil and do not serve God and his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These statements are here made, not to provoke a controversy, but in order that honest persons who desire to know the truth may have a proper understanding of our Society and its work. The Society and its supporters are in no wise interested in the politics of the present world. Our work and devotion is entirely to Jehovah God’s kingdom under Christ, because such is the only hope of the human race, and because all blessings must proceed from God, and his witnesses delight to obey his commandments because such is right. Having devoted ourselves to Jehovah God, the divine commission and duty is laid upon us to bear testimony before the rulers and the peoples of earth of and concerning the great Jehovah and his kingdom. We have no fight with any person on earth, but in fulfilling our commission and duty of telling the truth as contained in the Word of God we draw upon us the fire of the visible agents of the Devil, and amidst such opposition and persecution we proceed with the work assigned to us. Knowing that this work is being done at the commandment of the Lord God we are certain that no opposition can destroy it, but that it will go on until Jehovah’s name is completely vindicated.—Isa. 54:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has no formal creed, as that word is generally understood. It has no membership roll, but all who are truly devoted to God are asked to work together to the honor of Jehovah’s name. It is not in any wise engaged in propaganda, because it does not seek to propagate any doctrine or bring others into its fold. As the followers of Christ Jesus we believe and teach what is in the Scriptures, and nothing more and nothing less. That being God’s doctrine, no human creature could propagate it; hence our work is not propaganda, but merely bearing testimony to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNUAL REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">JEHOVAH has blessed the united efforts of his witnesses on the earth during the past year, and it is a real joy to report the progress of that work. Having in mind that this witness work is carried forward in North America and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the isles of the sea, and that the printed message is distributed in fifty-eight different languages, you will appreciate the fact that in this report it is practically impossible to give the minute details of the work. We must be content to make mention of some of the more important facts. Even though the number of the witnesses in the field is small, and the opposition is much greater now than in times past, yet the results show that the work of bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom has gone steadily forward. This fact will serve as a comfort to each one who is privileged to have a part in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses today and every day delights to sing forth the praises of the Most High. It could not be otherwise with them. For many centuries the lovers of righteousness have waited for the coming of Jehovah’s King and his kingdom, and now Christ is here and his reign has begun. Soon wickedness shall be eliminated from the earth, Jehovah’s name vindicated, and the people brought to a realization of the .fact that lasting peace has come to earth, and everlasting blessings to all who have good will toward God and righteousness. The fulfilment of the prophetic utterance at the time of the birth of Jesus is now being realized. (Luke 2:9-14) Jehovah’s witnesses are privileged not only to discern these truths, but to announce them to others and thus to declare amongst the people the gracious works of the Almighty God. With gladness they have received the truth, and with joy and boldness they tell the truth to others.—Isa. 12: 2-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First we delight to give thanks to Jehovah for the abundance of food provided for his own at the temple. He gave his word that all who are born of his organization shall be taught or fed by him and shall have great peace, and we have now abundant evidence that this precious promise is being fulfilled. Christ Jesus, the Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, has gathered unto himself at the temple those whom he has found faithful. Jehovah and Christ are the teachers, and Christ imparts to those of the temple company the present-day truths, and thus he teaches or feeds them upon food convenient for their upbuilding and consolation. All of the temple class fully appreciate the fact that no man is teaching them and that they need no man to teach them. Their strength comes from the Lord, because he is the great Shepherd of the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among other precious things which the Lord has taught his people during the year is the truth that the church have ‘ come into the unity of faith and knowledge’ and ‘henceforth are no more carried away by every wind of doctrine and the craftiness of men’. (Eph. 4:11-14) The cleansing of the temple is an accomplished fact. Those of the temple class are at unity, and henceforth ‘ ‘ in his temple doth every one speak of his glory”.—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year among some of the companies there have been disturbances made by fault-finders and murmurers, but it is quite manifest that such faultfinders and trouble-makers are not of the temple. They may be walking along in the company of some of the temple members, but in fact they are outside of God’s organization and cannot see what is on the inside. Only those of the temple class appreciate the truth and rejoice in their privileges just now. The temple class will proceed together in unity. They will not, and are not disposed to, waste any time in discussing foolish and unnecessary things, nor do they make an effort to justify themselves before men, knowing that such a course is displeasing to the Lord. (Luke 16:15) They know that Christ Jesus is their Judge and, if they are faithful in the performance of their divinely given commission, they will please him and please the Eternal Father, and that is all-sufficient. For this reason the faithful push forward in the work which has been assigned to them. They have and do manifest patience, which means that, knowing they are right and doing the Lord’s work according to his commandment, and have the approval of the Lord, even though suffering great inconvenience, persecution and contradiction of sinners, they steadfastly move on and boldly declare God’s truth as they go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the great Teacher has made known to his own the meaning of other prophecies not heretofore understood, and these truths have served as a great comfort and stimulus to the faithful, and thus the Lord has sustained them in making a hard battle. As you read here concerning some of the experiences of your brethren in other parts of the earth you will rejoice that you are privileged to be a part of the organization of the Lord that suffers at the hands of the wicked and yet amidst all such cruel opposition does not break its ranks but marches onward singing the praises of the Most High. Every one of the temple loves every other member of that blessed temple class, and all must be and are at complete unity. It is a little company united in the holy cause of Jehovah’s kingdom and in obedience to his commandments which continues to lift high the standard of the King that others may have the opportunity to know the true God and to set their hopes upon his King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the message of truth has been ‘proclaimed from the housetops’ by means of radio, by other means of speech, and by the wide distribution of books, booklets and magazines. The factory in Brooklyn has run on full time. Likewise the factory in Switzerland has operated full time. The Society’s factory at Magdeburg, Germany, during the first part of the year operated three shifts of eight hours each per day, but about the middle of the year the enemy succeeded in closing it down. The production during the year, however, will be of great comfort and satisfaction to those who have had some part in the work. The distribution of the books and booklets amongst the people in all languages during the year has reached the aggregate of 24,074,401 volumes. Had not the enemy hindered the work in Germany the distribution would have been greater. We are not disturbed, however. The Lord is at the helm and he has good reason in permitting everything, and with this we are entirely content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has declared that all shall know that he is God. It seems clearly to appear that now is the time when those who have been taken out from the world for his name’s sake must deliver Jehovah’s message to the rulers and to the people that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here. The enemy and his agents on earth, particularly the Catholic hierarchy, continue to fight desperately against Jehovah’s witnesses. This is to be expected. Regardless of all opposition Jehovah’s organization, like a great war chariot, moves majestically forward. The world is in a great economic depression and steeped in crime, and this condition continues to grow worse. The people of good will desire to hear the message of truth; hence the work of advertising the King and the Kingdom has progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the year ending September 1932 slightly more than twenty-two million books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. For the year ending September 1933 more than twenty-four million books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people; an increase of approximately two millions over the preceding year. In the report for 1932 it appeared that from the year 1922 to the year 1932 the distribution of the books and booklets carrying the message of the Kingdom aggregated 132,779,040. For the year 1933 the output exceeded any previous year, as above stated, bringing the total distribution since 1922 up to 156,853,441.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These figures do not take into consideration, however, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which during that period of time has been devoted exclusively to present-day truth published twice each month, and would aggregate the equivalent of 1,309,040 bound books. In addition thereto are also the Year </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Books,</span><span class="font3"> issued once each year since 1926, and the distribution of which up to the present time aggregates more than 214,204 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the praise of Jehovah and his King has been sung by those who love him and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is to be regretted, however, that with a few of the companies of Jehovah’s people there are some who formerly held the office of “elective elder” and who still think that they should spend their time by giving addresses before the companies or others that might be assembled. Such do not seem to have an appreciation of the way the Lord is carrying forward his work. Jehovah’s capital organization is functioning according to his will. Every one in that organization must be a witness, and the method which the Lord is blessing ought to be sufficient evidence that the work is being carried on according to his will. The radio and transcription machines advertise the truth and open the way for approach to the people, and then the individual workers carry the message into the homes of those who wish to hear. Personalities do not enter into the matter at all. If the Lord has assigned one part of the work to some and another part to others, then each one should be glad to do his or her part and not covet the work that is assigned to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the brethren have expressed their opinion that the president of the Society is given too much advertisement and that others should be advertised somewhat. Be assured that the advertisement is not of an individual, but only in connection with the truth. Probably somebody else could do it better, but let each one be content with what the Lord gives him to do. There are very few murmurers, however, walking along with the real ones. The Lord’s parable concerning the laborers in the vineyard clearly shows that there would be some murmurers, and we should expect to find some; but this will not at all disturb the ones who really delight to do with their might what their hands find to do and not worry about what somebody else is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the teachers, and all in the temple are taught by them and not by men. Some in the organization are used to print and manufacture literature, while others are used to put it out; but there is no preference to anyone. All are one compact body engaged in a common cause, and those who really love Jehovah and his kingdom are following organization instructions without murmuring or complaining. With all such the year has been filled with joyful service, and the faithful workers today are strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The year concludes with Jehovah’s witnesses fully united in spirit and in the service of the Lord. Those really of the temple are avoiding all controversies with those who oppose the method of carrying on the work. The faithful fully appreciate the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the capital organization of Jehovah, that he is the great Prophet, and it is the privilege and duty of each one of the faithful class to be obedient to his commandments; as it is written: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory,” and not of the glory of men. The faithful remnant have but a single purpose, and that is to do faithfully the will of God. They keep in mind the precious words written for their comfort: “Jehovah sitteth as King for ever. Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” (Psalm 29: 9-11, A.R.V.) With full assurance of faith, and strong of hope, the faithful continue their onward march, giving praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A TRULY BLESSED YEAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At our annual business meeting, last Sunday, we unanimously agreed to write you expressing once more our united love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The service year just closed has been a truly blessed one for all who have put forth a sincere effort to exalt the name of Jehovah our God. We will not take up your time with details of our many happy experiences throughout a year filled with real, practical kingdom service. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers, Bulletins </span><span class="font2">and other literature repeatedly tell of the joy, peace and unity possessed by Jehovah’s witnesses as they march to the war, and because these things enter into our experiences we know that what is written is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whilst acknowledging Jehovah as the author of all good, we are not so unthankful as to forget the means he is pleased to use to dispense his blessings. Accordingly, we desire to tell you of our appreciation of all your unselfish service, including the writing of the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> which is now in our hands and is going on our schedule as a topic of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We remember you always in our prayers, and are determined, by divine grace, to press on with you throughout the new year and as long as it is the Lord’s good pleasure to have us continue here.</span></p>

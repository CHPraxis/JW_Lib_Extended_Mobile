<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency</span><span class="font5"> teas </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">found in me; and. also before thee, 0 king, have I done no hurt.”—Dan. 6: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S rules of action do not change, even as lie does not change. (Mal. 3:6) This truth was reflected by the unchangeable law of the Medes and Persians. The fact that the Scriptures mention the unchangeablencss of the laws of the Medes and Persians is further evidence that everything recorded in the Bible is recorded for a definite purpose, and particularly for the interest of those who now constitute the remnant. The great question for determination is the supremacy of God, and this question is now to be settled, and in this is involved the integrity of God’s creatures. The man Jesus was perfect, yet he must prove his integrity, and this he could do only by suffering from the assaults made upon him by the enemy Satan. “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” (Heb. 5:8) “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” (2 Tim. 3:12) “Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) The faithful men of old, including Daniel the prophet, of necessity must be and were subject to the same rule of testing to determine their integrity, and this entailed upon them much suffering. The things concerning them were written aforetime for the comfort of the remnant now on earth. When we appreciate what Daniel and other faithful men of his time had to endure, we can understand why Jehovah permits his faithful witnesses in these perilous times to suffer at the hand of the enemy and his agents. By no other means could their integrity be fully tested and proved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The shamefaced, bewhiskered, hypocritical satraps stood before the king, holding, as they confidently believed, the death warrant of Daniel in their hand. The spokesman for that wicked combine then addressed the king in behalf of his coconspirators: “Then answered they, and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, 0 king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.”—Dan. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> What was the real reason or cause that moved those conspirators to desire the death of Daniel? Surely not merely because he was a Jew. Had Daniel been agreeing with and working harmoniously with the crooked satraps they would not care whether he was a Jew or of some other nationality. Daniel was the only honest man among all the satraps, and it was his honesty and faithfulness that interfered with their graft operations carried on as officials of the government. Jehovah’s law required Daniel to be honest and fair in all his dealings, and Daniel was obedient to God’s law and he was not being guided by the laws or customs amongst men. Daniel must and did do Hie very right thing; otherwise he would not have had Jehovah’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The hypocritical satraps who wickedly sought the life of Daniel evidently made mention to the king and emphasized the fact that it was a Jew who had been found violating his decree, and this they did for the purpose of arousing the indignation of the king against the Jews, even though the law of the Jews was different from that of the Medes. The king had issued his decree, which decree must be fully obeyed by all at their peril, and it would really have made no difference whether the violator was a Jew or a Gentile. The mention of the fact that Daniel was a Jew discloses the malice on the part of the satraps. Haman employed the same tactics when he said: “There is a certain people [Jews] scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people, neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.” (Esther 3:8) This has always been the policy of the Devil, to create prejudice in the minds of the ruling powers against those sought to be destroyed. The proof now brought by these conspirators that Daniel was disobeying the royal decree should, as they reasoned, be enough to stir the indignation of the king and bring about the immediate execution of the offender. The conspirators, claiming complete loyalty to the king, would present an argument before the king to this effect: That this man Daniel holds a high position in the government, am] his conduct not only is a gross insult to the king but is such a bad example before the people that the people will he led to disregard the law, and therefore he greatly endangers the peace and safety of the nation. The decree recently issued by the German government against Jehovah’s witnesses is to the same effect, that Jehovah’s witnesses serve and worship their God Jehovah and by so doing they thereby endanger the peace and safety of the state, and that hence Jehovah’s witnesses must be suppressed. Oh the same theory, backed by the same false and fraudulent argument, earthly agents of Satan in other places are attempting to enact laws to prevent the proclamation of the truth. This effort is put forth in many of the states of the United States of America, and in other countries, which laws if enacted would lead to the destruction of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses concerning God's kingdom and would cause the imprisonment and probably the death of many of such witnesses; and this the conspirators desire in order to prevent the people from knowing of their own crookedness. The present or modern-day conspirators seek a “lawful means’’ to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, and it must be expected that before Armageddon the nations of “Christendom” will by law forbid the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and if the faithful persist in the witness work and service of Jehovah God many of them will be adjudged as deliberate lawbreakers.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">371 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The experience of Daniel forwarns of just such a condition as now obtains throughout the earth. A like wicked rule is already enforced in Germany, and the enemy, moving particularly through the Catholic hierarchy, is endeavoring to put such so-called “laws” in operation in the United States and other parts of the earth. In Germany Jehovah’s witnesses are subject to all manner of indignities merely because they have in their possession printed literature enabling them to understand the Word of God. In this the faithfulness and integrity of the witnesses of Jehovah in that land is put to a severe test. God’s permitting it to be done is manifestly for the purpose of testing their integrity. As Hainan said to the king, and as likewise the conspirators concerning Daniel, 'This people should not be permitted to longer exist in this land.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0</sup> Evidently Darius the king saw the trap into which he had been unwittingly led, but, being the supreme ruler, he must now stand by his own decree and the fixed laws of the nation. Men holding public office today see the hypocrisy of the clergy and their allies and observe their wrongful course taken against Jehovah’s witnesses, but such officials have not the courage to rise above the petty technicalities of the law and declare what is right, because they are. in fear of losing what they have. Being in fear of man, they are led into the snare. They are easily induced to say that public policy and the law are of first importance, and they arc easily induced to side-step iho real issue and to thereby permit the innocent to suhir and God’s name to be defamed. We must keep in mind that in the ease of Darius the king lie was performing a part in a great prophetic picture, even though he knew nothing about that prophetic picture. We must keep in mind that the king here pictured regal power, which power the conspirators hoped to induce to act in their behalf and against a righteous one. “Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.”—Dan. 6:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> 1t cannot be concluded that Darius was displeased with Daniel, but he was displeased with Ilie course of events which had put Daniel in this tight position and which had been brought about by the sinful and crooked acts of the officials of the government. This illustrates the displeasure of Jehovah with those who make and enforce laws upon the pretext of protecting the people, but the real purpose of which is to cause Jehovah’s witnesses to be brought into difficulties and to suffer injustice. The purpose of the conspirators is to cause the punishment of men and ■women because of their faithfulness in obeying God’s law. To be sure, Jehovah could immediately causa the persecution of his witnesses to cease; but, having heretofore decreed that Satan should have opportunity to carry out his boastful challenge, Jehovah will not change that decree, but permits Satan to &gt;&nbsp;through with his malicious work until God's due time for the complete vindication of his own great name. The opportunity is thus furnished for Jehovah’s witnesses to prove their integrity and hence to have a part in the vindication of God’s name. That is a marvelous privilege granted to creatures. Jehovah's witnesses can take great consolation now in the fact that they are permitted to sufi'er from the assaults of the enemy and thus have an opportunity to prove their integrity towards Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup> Darius the king probably felt some responsibility before Daniel’s God in permitting this faith fid man to come into the position of such great disadvantage to himself; hence, it is written, he “set his heart on Daniel to deliver him, and lie laboured” to accomplish that purpose. This illustrates how Jehovah provides the means for his faithful witnesses to present their cases before worldly courts to the end that his witnesses may give their testimony, and that, if released from custody of the unrighteous and from the penalties of misapplied law, they might be free to continue as witnesses in giving the testimony of the kingdom until their work is completed. Surely it is not the will of Jehovah that his witnesses make no effort to defend themselves before the courts. Such is an occasion, when one is arrested and put to trial, to give testimony to the name of Jehovah God and thus to boldly declare his name. Jehovah’s witnesses, by stating their position before the courts and the legislative bodies, are thereby giving testimony to the name of Jehovan and informing the people of Jehovah’s provisions made for them and all who will serve righteousness. The official element that is used by the conspirators to bring about the suffering and punishment of Jehovah’s witnesses must be told the reason for the giving of the testimony of and concerning the kingdom, and this makes known to them that by opposing Jehovah’s witnesses they are fighting against God. (Acts 5:38,39) Thus Jehovah uses his witnesses by putting in their mouths the scriptures and legal argument and giving them opportunity and ability to present this before the magistrates and courts, and to do so in a forcible manner such as worldly lawyers do not see and will not do. Worldly lawyers look at the technicalities involved. Jehovah’s witnesses have but one purpose, and that is to magnify the name of Jehovah, and lienee they see and present the real issue. Such is the reason for the “Order of Trial’’ and for the petitions and protests filed before the legislative bodies of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Evidently Darius the king heard the conspirators to the conclusion of their argument and then recessed his court that he might consider ways and means to rescue Daniel. During that recess the conspirators would be wondering why the king delayed in handing down his decree, and their spokesman would be ready to again stress before the king the unchange-ablencss of the law of the Medes and Persians and to insist that Daniel must be immediately fed to the lions. Then the king again assembled his court and sat upon his throne of judgment, and solemnly and with great dignity the hypocritical satraps again filed in and stood before the king. “Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, 0 king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king established! may be changed.” (Dan. 6:15) In modern times magistrates and judges of courts listen to similar arguments and then recess the court for a time upon the pretext of taking the matter under consideration or .advisement. Then later such magistrates and judges say: “We see no wrong in these people called Jehovah’s witnesses, but we must enforce the law<sup>r</sup> as it is written. We are powerless to help them.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The hypocritical satraps would see to it that the people were told that Daniel, the highest president of the land, was about to be sentenced to death. This they would do during the recess of the court. The morbid and bloodthirsty would hurry to the king’s palace and would crowd each other to come near and hear the sentence pronounced and to behold the “faithful satraps”; and the wicked-minded would say to each other: “What wonderful satraps we have to bring this lawbreaker to justice.” The high court of King Darius now duly assembled, the hypocritical satraps would see to it that they were standing in the front ranks in order that they might sec the complete humiliation of an honest Jew who had hindered them in their crooked work. A silence like that unto death prevails in the court room. Daniel is brought in and subjected to the gaze of the morbid crowd. Probably that was the first time he had appeared before the court after the conspiracy was formed, and now he was to be sentenced to a horrible death. Imagine yourself being an onlooker and hearing the stentorian court crier announcing the king's command: “Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and east him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniil, Thy God, whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.”—Dan. 6:1G.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Did the king, Darius, there picture regal power delivering up the innocent to suffer unjust punishment? The crucial test must eotne, else how could the witnesses of Jehovah prove their integrity? We can therefore easily see that Darius the king did occupy the position of representing regal power deliverin r up the innocent to their executioners. Jihovah permits his witnesses to be delivered up and subjected to unjust punishments, that the test may be. applied in vindication of his name and as a testimony against his enemies. “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; ami ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.”—Mark 13; 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> It is just as Jesus stated to his conspiring enemies: “Thou eouldest have no power at ail against me, except it. were given thee from above.” (John 19; 11). In that same connection Jesus further said, in order to disclose the most reprehensible: “Therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.” Today the class that “hath the greater sin” is the Judas or “man of sin” class, which class betrays Jehovah’s faithful ones into the hands of the cruel enemy. Those who have once been enlightened in the truth concerning the kingdom and who turn again to the “beggarly elements” of the Devil's world are in a position to more easily locate Jehovah’s witnesses and their manner of work and to misrepresent these to officials and cause Jehovah’s witnesses to be arrested and punished.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Being put into the den of lions was a place of fearfulness and of great danger, and hence a place of certain death to Daniel unless Jehovah furnished him protection. Let those who are faithfully performing their covenant in seiwing Jehovah God be just as fearless as was Daniel. Manifestly Daniel did not show any fear. His persecutors were vicious, even as the persecutors and conspirators against .Jehovah's witnesses today are vicious and are just as vicious as wild beasts, and would just as quickly tear God's faithful ones to shreds if permitted to do so. &quot;While this is being written it is reported that an officer, taking into custody one of Jehovah’s witnesses who had mercij’ been announcing a broadcast concerning God's Word had said to Jehovah’s witness, and in a manner vicious and wicked: &quot;I would like to kill every damn’ one of you.” We must here have in mind that the lions in the den where Daniel was put were the king’s lions, and therefore those lions pictured Jehovah’s forces of justice, and which forces do destroy those who are guilty of breaking the divine law. Jehovah’s innocent witnesses are in danger when the conspirators or executioners assume to be ‘bearers of God’s sword not in vain’, and this they do when taking the law into their own hands. They fail to reckon that Jehovah is looking after his own. Those fully devoted to the Lord, and hence trusting in him, are shown as saying under such conditions: ”0 Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me; lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.” (1’s. 7:1, 2) ‘‘My soul is among lions; and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.”—Ps. 57:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAFETY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah knows full well who serves him in spirit and in truth, and his own he will preserve. King Darius saw the helplessness of his position because of the unchangeable law, yet his confidence in Daniel and in Daniel’s God was great. Hence he said to Daniel: ‘‘Thy God, whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.” That was a real tribute to Daniel’s integrity toward Almighty God. It was an acknowledgment by a heathen king, yet it represented God’s tribute to those who are faithful to him. In these perilous days Jehovah permits his faithful witnesses to be led away to prison and to suffer indignities at the hand of Satan’s agents, and yet at the same time he gives them full assurance that he will preserve and deliver those who remain faithful and true to him. ‘‘The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even for evermore.” (Ps. 121:7,8) Doubtless inanj' of Jehovah’s witnesses in recent months have remembered these precious words of the Scripture when they have been led by the strongarm squad and placed behind prison bars. This is further evidence that the things heretofore written were written for their comfort and hope. ‘‘The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.” (2 Pet. 2: 9) ‘‘Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. He kcepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. ’ ’—Pg. 34:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The record does not disclose any reply that Daniel made </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> the words of the king when being sentenced; he said nothing to his persecutors. It is quite probable that he stood mute before the court; but if he spoke it must have been words similar to those spoken by his brethren on a previous occasion, who said: ‘‘If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, 0 king.” (Dan. 3:17) This would show Daniel’s complete confidence in Jehovah. The Judeans held in captivity in Babylon and who remained faithful trusted in Jehovah God; and now likewise in these modern days the faithful ones, in the world, are compelled to walk amidst Satan’s organization and to likewise trust Jehovah God, and are assured that he will keep them in safety and that he will in due time deliver them. Jehovah always rewards the faithful; and where they make Him their fear and refuge, to such he is a sanctuary and complete protection.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The conspirators would take no chance on Daniel’s escaping from the lions’ mouths; therefore they saw to it that the den was securely fastened and sealed after Daniel had been east in to the lions. ‘‘And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might hot be changed concerning Daniel.” (Dan. 0:17) They would demand that 1hc king would seal it with his signet, and then these pious-faced hypocritical lords would stick their signets on the wax as though that would make it stronger. We are reminded how the same hypocritical crowd did concerning the body of Christ Jesus. But why did the king seal the den ? The word and the name of the king was involved, and the conspirators would demand that there be no possible hope of Daniel’s escape, and hence they would insist on the king’s seal to be there in order that he might not change his decree. Likewise Jehovah’s name is now involved, the test is upon his remnant, and he permits the test to be carried through in order that the enemy may have no excuse to say that Jehovah has changed his decree or law. To be sure, the enemy could do nothing against the remnant save by the permission of Jehovah, who lets the enemies have all the rope that they desire and go the full length of it. He could stop the persecution of his witnesses at any time, but he will do it only in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1T</sup> The satraps put their seal upon the stone, and in doing this they thereby testified against themselves as to their own responsibility for Daniel’s ill-treatment and for his death, if that should follow. The satraps did not trust the king to faithfully keep his word; and even so today the agents of Satan have no confidence in the word of Jehovah God. but insist on carrying out their own supposed authority. If they trusted Jehovah God they would leave to him the punishment of wrongdoers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> When a person desires to search deeply into a matter he refrains from food and avoids what is called pleasure. He will not permit anything to distract his careful consideration from the subject matter. The brain is clearer when the stomach is not so well filled. Darius knew that Daniel was in a perilous place, and although his words show that he had confidence in Daniel’s God that lie would deliver him, he likewise knew that he as the king must do what he could consistently do to deliver Daniel. He might have thought that, he would be able to do something to bring about Daniel’s deliverance, and that, hence he must keep a clear mind and be on the alert and ready to act; hence, it is written, “Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him; and his sleep went from him.” (Dan. 6:18) This does not mean that God has to fast or refrain from pleasure, but here evidently it means that when a man has a serious task to perform, he should see to it that he conserves his faculties and uses them to the very best advantage. Darius was thus showing a genuine interest in Daniel’s welfare. This pictures how Jehovah has a deep interest in all of those whom he has anointed to be his witnesses and that, when they are passing through some strenuous ordeal that entails upon them suffering and puts them in great danger, Jehovah is watching over them with an eye. that never sleeps. Jehovah himself loves his own and, as it is written, “In all their affliction he was afflicted.’’ “For he that touch-eth you {his anointed] toucheth the apple of his eye.” (Isa. 63:9; Zech. 2:8) In harmony with this the anointed pray: “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me under the shadow of thy wings.”—Ps. 17: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are now in a tight place anti must watch, and the Lord watches with them. There is unity of all in God's organization. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are one with those of the remnant, and hence all at the temple are one with Them, that is to say, all arc deeply interested in the outcome of the test now upon the anointed. During this time of great danger the entire company of the remnant as the representatives of the King of Eternity keep themselves in an attitude of prayer and sober thoughtfulness lest they miss some opportunity of doing honor to the name of the Host High. The hour of great testing is upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and hence the admonition of the apostle, written under inspiration of the holy spirit, should now be heeded: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” (Eph. 6:18) They thus pray that they may at the opportune time open their mouths boldly and make known the purposes of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Daniel was in the lions’ den all night, and that would afford ample time for the unchangeable law of the realm to be fully satisfied and justice to be fully executed by Daniel’s being devoured by the lions. The king reasoned that, if Daniel continued to live at. the dawn of morning, he would live only by God’s intervention and hence it was time for him to be delivered or brought up out of the lions’ den; hence, it is written, “Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.” (Dan. 6:19) The king had not slept during the night, and as soon as day dawned he went to the relief of his trusted servant. Jehovah watches over his faithful ones and keeps his own, and he “shall neither slumber nor sleep”. (Ps. 121:4, 5) His capital organization is dear to Jehovah’s heart: “God is in the midst of her [his organization]; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.” (Ps. 46:5) These precious words are written in the Scriptures to give assurance and comfort to those who are passing through times of peril, that they might fully trust Jehovah, come what may.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Darius was deeply moved by reason of the unjust treatment to which his trusted servant Daniel hud been subjected, and he was righteously indignant that he had been unwittingly drawn into the position where he must put Daniel in a place of great danger. This is shown by his words as he approached the den: “And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel; and the king spake and said to Daniel, 0 Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?”—Dan. 6:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> In order to carry out his purpose to the complete vindication of his name Jehovah permits his faithful servants to suffer even unto a sacrificial death, all of which is precious in his sight; as it, is written: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” (Ps. 116:15) This does not mean that Jehovah is unable to prevent the suffering of the faithful, but he must be faithful and true to his own word and then in due time exercise his power in behalf of those whose hearts arc perfect toward him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> As the king approached the den of the lions where Daniel was supposed to have been devoured, he cried out. Likewise while the faithfid remnant are now in the midst of the wild beasts that control this world Jehovah proclaims to them, “Ye are mj' witnesses . . . that I am God.” These are a part of his “faithful and wise servant” class; hence Jehovah says to them: ‘In my servant my soul has delight.’ (Isa. 42:1-7; 43:10-12) Doubtless the hypocritical satraps were either personally present or had some of their representatives near the den who would be crying out to Daniel, “Is your God able to save you now?” It is even so in the present time that the representatives of Satan in mockery and derision ask of Jehovah’s witnesses, “Is your Jehovah able to deliver you from our law? We will show you who is the law in this land.” Darius, in asking the question as he approached the den, shows that now Jehovah asks a similar question of his witnesses in order to afford the faithful witnesses an opportunity to acknowledge their protection and deliverance, and that this is entirely due to Jehovah’s loving-kindness and his power exercised in their behalf. No one of the remnant could have a reason to boast of what he accomplishes in his own behalf. All honor is due and must be and will be given to the King eternal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD'S ANGELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’‘Jehovah’s angels are at all times on the alert to carry out the orders of the Most High. (Matt. 18:10) Daniel had some knowledge of this because, as he knew, on a former occasion Jehovah had sent his angel and delivered his three friends from the fiery furnace. Now he had witnessed the stopping of the lions’ mouths for his own protection, and this he knew to be a protection from God exercised by and through his angels. Though still in the den of the lions, Daniel answered King Darius with words of good cheer: “Then said Daniel unto the king, 0 king, live for ever.” (Dan. G:21) Thus Daniel acknowledged the king as his friend.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Daniel’s heart was pure and he spoke gracious words to the king. “He that loveth with a pure heart, and hath grace on his lips, will have the king as his friend.” (Prov. 22:11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leaser)</span><span class="font5"> Even so in these wicked days Jehovah’s witnesses in the clutches of the strong-arm squad, and hence in great danger of bodily harm, confidently respond through Christ, proclaiming that Jehovah lives for ever, and that he is the Friend, the shield and protector of those who faithfully serve him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Daniel was quick to assure Darius that the God whom he served had delivered him by the hand of his angel. “My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee. 0 king, have I done no hurt.” (Dan. 6:22) The faithful remnant know that Christ Jesus, the mighty Angel of Jehovah God, is present and is accompanied by his host of holy angels, and is charged with the preservation of those who are faithful unto the Most High. (Matt. 25:31) The remnant now appreciate the precious promises long ago written for their benefit in these perilous hours, to wit: “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (Ps. 34: 7) “For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”—Ps. 91:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> The lions in that den belonged to the king, and hence they represented Jehovah’s justice. (Rev. 4:7; 6:1) Those lions could not destroy Jehovah’s faithful servant, nor will God’s justice today destroy those who are faithful and true to him. The malicious enemy may kill the body of some of those who are faithful to Jehovah, but the everlasting existence of these anointed ones is in the hand of the Most High, and nothing can pluck them out. Satan has at all times tried to destroy men who show their faithfulness to Jehovah. Paul had a similar experience, and after all men had forsaken him he said: “Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known,<sup>-</sup>and that all the [nations] might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.” (2 Tim. 4:17,18) In these wicked days of conspiracy against the anointed of God the beastly element that now rules the earth would quickly destroy the remnant except for the protection that God furnishes them through his angels. With complete confidence and trust in the Most High the faithful constantly present their petitions to the throne of divine grace and continue in diligence to proclaim God's name and his kingdom; as it is written: “They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.” (Ps. 22:13,21,22) “Lord, how long wilt thou look on I rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling [A.Zi.V., margin: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dear</span><span class="font5"> life] from the lions. I will give thee thanks in the great, congregation: I will praise thee among much people.” (Ps. 35:17, 18) Jehovah gives assurance to those who have wholly devoted themselves Io him and who continue faithful, and says to them: “Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.”—Ps. 91:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Daniel was fully aware of the fact that he was innocent, and had done no wrong to anyone. It is even so today with the faithful remnant, who are likewise innocent and harmless before God and man. The modern-day conspirators falsely charge Jehovah’s witnesses with wrongdoing and work themselves into a frenzy in trying to convince themselves that Jehovah’s witnesses arc doing wrong, but they are entirely unable to establish by truthful and competent evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses are wrongdoers. The faithful witnesses of God refuse to have any part with wrongdoers, and that causes Satan’s agents to be greatly enraged at them. The true and faithful to God say in the language of the psalmist: “I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, 0 Lord: that 1 may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.” (Ps. 26:5-8) They are pure in heart and continue to proclaim Jehovah’s gracious words, and therefore they have the King eternal for tlwir friend. —Prov. 22:11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leaser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> The preservation of Daniel by the angel of Je-liovah God was proof that Daniel had been faithful. Likewise the preservation of the reinnant of God’s organization by the hand of his trusted officers is a confirmation that these witnesses have been faithfully maintaining their integrity before God. “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.” —Ps. 31: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> The conspirators against Jehovah and his anointed at the present day are entirely without truthful evidence that the remnant are movers of sedition or in any other manner willful violators of the law. Continuing to be the objects of the wrath of these conspirators, the faithful remnant receive the persecution without murmuring, well knowing that God is permitting them to have these fiery trials to carry out his own good purposes. ‘‘For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”—Phil. 2:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Compared to life everlasting with the Lord the faithful remnant count not their present existence at all dear to them, having always in mind their privilege of proving true and faithful to Jehovah. Like Paul and others of the same spirit, they now say: ‘‘Neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.” (Acts 20:24) The testimony of Jesus Christ has been committed to the remnant, and they know that they must fight to the finish. And in this conflict they have confidence that Jehovah will send his angel before them to protect and deliver them to the praise and honor of his holy name.—Hev. 12:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are now engaged in a righteous and holy war against a host of unseen wicked ones. (I’lph. 6:12) These unseen ones are using earthly creatures as their visible instruments for persecution. In themselves the remnant have no strength, and hence no ability to withstand the assaults of the powerful enemy, but in Christ Jesus they are invulnerable to the attacks of the enemy and in Christ they shall gain the victory. The divine commandment ha.-been given to the anointed that ‘this gospel of the kingdom must be preached unto the nations as a witness before the final end’, and this the faithful will, do regardless of the vicious attacks made upon them by the enemy. Daily they observe the enemy forming wicked devices and striving to bring forth some ap parently lawful means of inflicting punishment upon God’s anointed, and they know that at any time they are liable to be thrown to the “lions” of so-called “worldly justice”, but, trusting in the Lord, they go on in delivering the testimony, which they are commanded to do. The remnant will now stand steadfast in Christ Jesus, having and exercising full confidence that Jehovah in his own good time and good way will ‘stop the mouths of lions’ in behalf of those who continue to maintain their integrity toward him. In all their trials and fights and tribulations the faithful remnant rejoice and sing, because they know that the final result will be to their good and to the honor of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Darius the king was glad that Daniel had been preserved. “Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.” (Dan. 6:23) Likewise Jehovah takes pleasure in the preservation of those who maintain their integrity towards him. Jehovah caused to be written in his record his expression of pleasure because of the faithfulness of Daniel and other like faithful witnesses, and in that record these words appear: “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.” (lleb. 1J : 33) This testimony was written long after the death of Daniel, and this of itself is further proof that the words were written for the comfort of the remnant who are today on earth. Jehovah at another place caused specific mention to be made of Daniel and his faithful companions, manifestly because of their faithfulness and devotion to the Most High. (ICzek. 14:14,20; Heb. 11:33,34) Can Jehovah put men on earth who under the most severe test will remain true and faithful to him? This is the great issue. Certain it is that God is pleased with those who do prove their integrity toward him; hence it is written: “The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he.will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.” (Zeph, 3: 17) It is those who arc faithful to Jehovah that he preserves and over whom he rejoices: “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord deliveretli him out of them all. He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken. The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants; and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.”—Ps. 34:19,20, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> King Darius commanded that Daniel should be brought up out of the den of lions. This could not foreshadow that before Armageddon the remnant would be taken out of danger. Not until Satan and all of his organization are destroyed will all danger be removed. Daniel was just as safe inside as he was outside of the lions’ den, because he had the protection of Jehovah’s angel. His being taken up from the den seems more particularly to picture that there would be'a series of acts of deliverance by Jehovah of the members of his anointed remnant, to tlu- end that they might continue to serve as his witnesses. “God is unto us a God of deliverances; and unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death.’’ (Ps. 68: 20, A./t’.V.) Such acts of deliverance would be an indication of Jehovah’s approval of his servant class, and would also serve as a comfort for them and to that extent would be a vindication of his holy name. The conspirators reason that the punishment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the terms of their laws, which are improperly called “rules of justice”, would prove that Jehovah’s witnesses are wrong, and hence that their lions (earthly rules of justice) would tear to pieces these “pestiferous” witnesses of Jehovah. The enemy, however, overlooks the fact that the lions in the prophetic picture belonged to the king and that they represented true justice that proceeds from the throne of God, and that real justice is meted out only by the Lord. No one could ever have occasion to regret his faithful devotion to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RETRIBUTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> The rule of retribution is a just law. “If a false witness rise up against any man, to testify against him that which is wrong'; then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days; and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.” (Deut. 19:16-20) The modern conspirators doubtless expect to get away with their wicked acts, but they will not deceive Jehovah. The fact that God caused this law of retribution to be promulgated at the time of the making of the covenant of faithfulness on the plains of Moab, and the further fact that Darius the king proceeded in exact harmony with that divine rule, is additional proof that Darius in this prophetic picture represented Jehovah God. “And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.”—Dan. 6: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The men that today rule in “Christendom” and who have joined in a conspiracy against Jehovah and his anointed, and have attempted their destruction, must in harmony with the divine rule be cast to the “lions” of divine justice, and this God will do in his due time. The conspiring satraps who suffered destruction by the lions foreshadowed the fate of 1he modern-day conspirators, including, to be sure, the “man of sin”, whose portion shall be with the hypocrites.—Matt. 24:50,51,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The dividing of the people is now in progress because the righteous Judge of Jehovah is now conducting his court of inquiry. The rulers in “Christendom” have already donned the vestments of Satanic worship, and thus they have definitely identified themselves as against God and his kingdom, and they must be brought before and delivered to the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”, to whom is committed all judgment and authority to execute judgment. (Kev. 5: 5; John 5:22,27) It is the day of the vengeance of our Ged, and Christ Jesus is the great Executioner and Vindicator. As the lions “brake all their bones in pieces”, even so Christ will destroy completely Satan’s wicked organization. “The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion.” (Prov. 19:12) “The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinncth against his own soul.”—Prov. 20:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Those who are the chief schemers and conspirators seeking to bring about the destruction of Jehovah’s remnant are the clergy of “Christendom” ami the Judas or “man of sin” class. Those conspirators have shown themselves to be like, wild beasts seeking the unjust punishment and destruction of Jehovah's remnant, and the rule of retributive justice must be applied to them; as it is written: “Therefore I will be unto them as a lion; as a leopard by the way will I observe them: I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul oi their heart, and there will 1 devour them like a lion: the wiki beast shall tear them.”—Dos. 13:7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> All who now take their stand on the side of the conspirators and against Jehovah, and who render aid and comfort to the conspirators, shall sutler a fate like that which came upon those who conspired against Daniel. The “Lion” of Jehovah, that is, his Executioner, will not spare even the wives and children of this wicked crowd; as it is written: “And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women; but come not near’ any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.” “Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the Lord.” (Ezek. 9: 5, 6; Isa. 14:21, 22) Those wicked conspirator's are so despicable in tire eyes of Jehovah God that, they will not be even accorded a decent burial: “Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned.”—Isa. 14:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The divine record is that the lions broke the b.mws of the conspiring satraps before they struck the hot-tom of the den. This indicates the swiftness of divine justice: “because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.” (Rom. 9:28) “I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord. ” (Ps. 101: 8) None of that wicked crowd will ever be permitted to abide in God’s kingdom. The Scriptures indicate that some of the remnant will actuallj’ witness the execution of this retributive justice against the conspirators, and this they will witness while on the earth. “And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God, Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field [including lions], Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.” (Ezek. 39:17) “Only with thine eyes shall thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.”—Ps. 91:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECREE OF PEACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wicked conspirators having been cleared out completely, it was a time for peace. Hence the king issued an appropriate decree: “Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.” (Dan. 6:25) This clearly seems to foreshadow the proclamation of universal peace that shall be issued by the Lord immediately following the execution of the wicked organization that takes place at Armageddon. “For out of Zion [Jehovah’s capital organization] shall go forth the law,” that is, the rule of action commanding what is right. (Isa. 2:3) It is the great King of Eternity speaking to the survivors of Armageddon by his Chief Officer, the Prince of Peace, and there must then follow the fulfilment of the prophetic utterance, “On earth peace, good will toward mon.” That will mean permanent peace for the peoples of earth; and in no other way can lasting peace come. “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.” (Isa. 9:7) “In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.” (Ps. 72:7) The people will then behold the evidence of Jehovah’s expressed wrath and will know that wars arc done for ever and that never again will wickedness rise up.—Ps. 46: 8, 9; Nah. 1: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The decree of King Darius brought Daniel prominently before the people and magnified the name of Jehovah, the God of Daniel. In harmony with this Darius wrote in his decrece: “I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom mon tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.”—Dan. 6: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> That decree seems clearly to foreshadow the fust decree of the new heaven following Armageddon. The remnant being still on earth at that time, the decree of the Lord will necessarily bring them prominently before the people as the faithful servants of the Host High God and of Christ, who maintained their integrity toward Jehovah under the most trying conditions. Then those faithful men and women who have undergone horrid experiences, such as have been inflicted upon Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey, will be glad that they had the faith and courage to maintain their integrity toward God. They will look back upon the filthy jails and the harsh words and other unpleasant things that then came to them, and rejoice that it was their privilege to have a part therein, because they were on the right side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The battle of the great day of God Almighty will itself be a decree, because it will be royal expression causing all creation of earth to tremble and fear before Jehovah God. Then they shall know that Jehovah is God. The survivors will see that Jehovah has extended his favor to those faithful witnesses whom he has brought through the great tribulation, and they will know that the preservation of these faithful witnesses is the gracious act of the Almighty God. Then the Jonadabs in such places as New Jersey will rejoice that they insisted on worshiping Almighty God in truth and in spirit. Today only a few are desirous and willing to learn that Jehovah is God. Armageddon will fully convince all that he is the Most High. This the Devil himself must know before he is destroyed, that Jehovah is the all-powerful One. All the nations of earth shall tremble at his presence. (Isa. 64:2) When the storms of Armageddon have passed, then the royal decree will command that all shall fear and tremble before the Most High. “For he is the living God and abideth for ever.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lioth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> When Jehovah gave his law to his people chosen for his name he said to them: “And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy* God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” (Ex. 20:1-3) The battle of Armageddon will emphasize this great law to all living creation. Jehovah abides for ever, when all other gods and images are done for and gone for ever. The great controversy Who is The God? will then have been settled for ever. “Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that 1 will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.” (Jer. 51: 47,52) “The burden of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the mid.&gt;t of it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">(Isa. 19:1) “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. . . . 'They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.”—Jcr. 10:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">** In times past men have thought to establish a government which God would approve and perpetuate, and we know that all their efforts have been in vain. In these last days the nations of “Christendom” have combined to set up a league, which they call the “expression of God's kingdom on earth”, but which in truth and in fact is the great “abomination of desolation” about which God caused Daniel the prophet to prophesy. The decree issued by the king of Medo-Persia foretold the kingdom of God under Christ, and Daniel was divinely directed to write that this is the kingdom of God: “And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” This universal empire is the kingdom of the Most High; and the capital part thereof, the Christ, takes the leading part in the vindication of Jehovah's name and the everlasting rule of righteousness; hence the fruitless efforts of imperfect men to set up a kingdom are for ever at an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4T</sup> Jehovah God honored Daniel by permitting him to write a prophecy foretelling this great change from wicked earthly kings to his righteous kingdom, when he wrote: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” (Dan. 2:44) This completely and everlastingly settles the question of supremacy and of who shall rule the world, and in that great controversy Jehovah wins, and all who live shall for ever praise his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> Jehovah’s kingdom and righteous rule under Christ shall endure, “and his dominion shall bo even unto the end.” That means that his supremacy and sovereign rule shall continue. Were all other things to end, Jehovah’s supremacy and sovereign rule would continue for ever. “From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” The immediate rulership of the world Jehovah confers upon his beloved and chief witness Christ Jesus, and this he caused Daniel to record: “And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”—Dan. 7:14,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> What foolishness and insanity is today manifested by the world rulers in their counsel and conspiracy against Jehovah and against his anointed! How unwise the people, and what a great exhibition of blindness on their part, when they imagine that the imperfect men who now rule can rid the earth of the testimony of God and his kingdom and hold sway according to their own wicked pleasure! Concerning this great stupidity of man Jehovah long ago caused his prophet to write: “Why do the [nationsj rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take, cotmsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.” (Ps. 2:14) The present-day rulers of earth who bring forth schemes of so-called “national recovery” would do well to heed the wisdom expressed in the second Psalm, but they will close their eyes and ears entirely to the same. “Then shall he [Jehovah] speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in hi.; sore displeasure. Thou [Christ] shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a. potter’s vessel.”—Ps. 2: 5, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> In his communication to the people King Darius continued to magnify the supremacy and majesty of Jehovah God: &quot;He delivereth and rescucth, and be worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.” (Dan. (&gt;: 27) Jehovah’s power and goodnes; manifested in the deliverance and rescuing of his faithful ones are exemplified in modern times in his dealing with his remriant and the rescuing of them from the &quot;lions’ den” experiences. Time and again Satan and his agents have committed overt acts in this great conspiracy against God and his hidden on*, s and have attempted to bring about the death of members of the remnant, and time and again God has rescued and delivered them. When the Devil sent forth his mob to take Jesus, the Beloved of Jehovah, the great Master said to the leaders of the mob that he could ask and receive from his Father twelve legions of angels for his protection. (Matt. 26:53) To his faithful witnesses, the remnant now on earth, who have put their trust wholly in Jehovah God, the Most High now says: “For he shall give his angels charge over tb.ee. to keep thee in all thy ways.” ( Ps. 91:11) When the Catholic hierarchy and other Satanic agents, including the strong-arm squad, lay vile hands upon Jehovah’s witnesses, these faithful ones are sure that Jehovah in his own good way and time will rescue them and deliver them from the “lions’ mouths”. “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly.” (2 Pet. 2:9) In the day of Jehovah’s wrath these wicked and malicious, false accusers that now rule the world will find no deliverance. Their gods will be utterly helpless and unable to deliver them in their great ordeal. To those wicked agents of Satan, who seek now to destroy the faithful remnant because they arc giving the testimony of Jesus Christ, it will be truly said: “Where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble.’’ (Jcr. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font5"> 28) Tn vain the rulers of “Christendom” have made unto themselves gods. (Isa. 44:17) Those hypocrites and oppressors will find no hope of escape or deliverance.—Jer. 25 : 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> Says the prophecy of Daniel: “And he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth.” For the aid and comfort of the faithful witnesses Jehovah God has revealed to them the meaning of these great signs and wonders which lie has worked in heaven and in earth. lie has shown them the two great “signs”, that is, the organization of Satan and the organization of Jehovah, and at Armageddon God will prove to all that these signs are true. Jehovah has worked signs and wonders in earth by using his faithful remnant, and in due time these also will bo confirmed as true. —Rev. 12:1-5; Ez'-k. 12:11; 24:24; Joel 2:30,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>C2</sup> The rescue of Daniel from the lions’ den foretold the rescue and delivery of the remnant from the eruel and unrighteous law and from the ravages that will come upon the earth during Armageddon. The remnant’s being on earth after the destruction of the wicked at Armageddon will prove that they arc on earth only by the power and grace of the Almighty God, and this will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name and power, and all creation then must acknowledge that Jehovah is God and that Christ is his chosen One to the glory of the Most High. Satan put forth his strongest efforts to destroy Noah, Daniel and Job, and Jehovah rescued and delivered these men and then caused to be written that he did so because those men were strong in faith and in their obedience to God and hence were righteous in his sight. (Ezck. 14: 14, 20) Likewise the righteousness of the remnant is the reason why God will deliver them. Their righteousness is not by reason of their own inherent goodness, but because they are in Christ Jesus, have full faith and confidence in God’s beloved One, and arc wholly devoted to God and his kingdom. Contrasting the wicked of the world with the meek and faithful remnant God’s Word declares: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness dcliver-eth from death.” (Prov. .10: 2) “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death. ’ ’—Prov. 11: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“’Daniel’s life and course of action continued to be a testimony to the name of Jehovah: “So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.” (Dan. 6:28) Cyrus, who foreshadowed Christ and who was a nephew of Darius the Mede, did not begin to reign as a successor in power to Darius until the end of the reign of Darius. This suggests that the one-thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus does not begin until after the destruction of Satan and his organization, which results in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. That would mean that the millennial reign of Christ, together with his 144.000 associates, begins immediately following Armageddon. The battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought by Christ Jesus as the Executioner and the Vindicator of Jehovah's name. Jehovah’s name being vindicated, then the great antitypical Cyrus succeeds the great antitypical Darius and takes over the entire rulership of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> The continued prosperity of Daniel would seem to picture the continued opportunity for service by the remnant while on earth and after Armageddon has been fought. Such opportunity for the remnant then would not be as “witnesses” to the name of Jehovah, seeing that Jehovah himself has then risen up for a testimony of his power and majesty. Tt would appear that these opportunities of the remnant after Armageddon would be as helpers and comforters of the people. (Mic. 5:7) The Scriptures do not indicate how long the remnant will be on the earth after Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> In the prophecy of Zechariah Jehovah speaks of Christ as “the man that is my fellow”. (Zech. 13:7; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pre para lion,</span><span class="font5"> page 258) The reign of Cyrus pictured the reign of Christ Jesus, “the man that is my [that is, Jehovah the Great Darius’] fellow.” The name Cyrus, according to the Greeks, was supposed to mean “the sun”. God’s prophet speaks of Christ Jesus as the “Sun of righteousness”. (Mal. 4:2) During the thousand years the reign of Christ Jesus is confined to this earth, and during the period of those years Jehovah reigns over all of his organization throughout the universe. (Eph. 4: 6) “And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world arc become the kingdoms of our Lord [Jehovah, the Great Darius], and of his Christ [the Great Cyrus]; and he shall reign for ever and ever.” (Rev. 11:15) These precious truths were recorded in times of old for the special help of the remnant in these days of great trial and peril. As they are discerned the unfolding of Jehovah’s prophecies is seen to be a manifestation of God’s loving-kindness toward the remnant, and they in the language of Paul exclaim: “O the. depth of the riches both of the wisdom and know'cdge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out 1 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?”— Rom. 11:33, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>58</sup> The year ending has been one of varied experiences, fraught with much peril. The “lions’ mouths” of the wicked organization have often opened to swallow up the faithful remnant, but the great Jehovah God, whom we serve, has delivered his beloved hidden ones from the hands of the wicked. Prison cells will not deter the faithful in giving the testimony to the name of the Most High. By the grace of God the faithful will continue to advertise the King ami his kingdom, and to magnify the name of the .Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Trusting implicitly in his everlasting arms to bear them up they will continue to march forward and sing: “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun.” —Deut. 33: 26, 27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICH, BEAUTIFUL, ENTRANCING, THRILLING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 </span><span class="font4">just can’t keep from writing you a little of my appreciation of the Lord’s blessing. The last </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font4"> explaining tlie ‘handwriting on the wall’, give me a thrill I just can't contain. The fulfilment of that prophetic drama is so exactly and minutely traced in the physical facts of recent years that it cannot be otherwise than true, in a general vvay at the very least, as anyone who has lived through it can well testify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My </span><span class="font4">heart rejoices continually in the ever increasing light and understanding the Lord so giaeiously gives us. That I should ever catch so clear a vision of the glory of the Lord is almost more than I can realize. And to think, almost all of this increased light and understanding has come after I thought I already had it. And now it is clear that the poet had it right: “and still there is more to follow.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How rich, how beautiful, how glorious, how entrancing and thrilling it all is: the story of Job, The Revelation, Ezekiel, Esther, Ruth. Zechariah, Daniel, etc.! As the poet says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It lifts me up to things above;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It bears on eagle wings;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It gives my joyful soul a taste,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And makes me, even here, to feast</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With Jesus’ priests and kings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would seem, Brother Rutherford, that the Lord has caused to be used certain statements, expressions and words as kevs, in opening to us the treasure stores of knowledge and understanding of his Word and purposes. Such, for instance, as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prophecy—understood only when physical facts in fulfilment are compared; Jehovah; name; Jehovah’s organization; Cl.nst Jesus, Jehovah’s executive officer; vindication of Jehovah's name; regal power; overlaid; Devil overreaches; int'grity: the use of angels; and including the definition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lore:</span><span class="font4"> &quot;the perfect expression of unselfishness”; and of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">holiness:</span><span class="font4"> “complete devotion to God”: etc. Just as one has to know bow to use a key, the careful study and understanding of tlu'i-e points have aided me to see the vision that the Loid promised “young men” would see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another thing I know you will be glad to know is, that after ‘eldeiing’ for twenty-live or thirty years and going through all that nightmare of class trouble I was glad to sec the temple cleansed. And let me tell you something about that, will you please? I have not yet seen a single word tl.ot y.,u have said about that that is at all out of the way. If there is one single individual in all this wide world who doesn’t like this cleansing of the temple, it is the best possible proof he can offer that bn is not of the temple cln<sup>t</sup>-3. And I am not .■feeling badly toward anybody, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well I know it I were teihng you all this face to face before I had hardly got thiough you would ask me how the witness work was getting on in these parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we camo here live years ngo we found only two Jw’s, away out in the country, afoot (no car). They were alite, though,-and they ate still alive; also a pioneer just leaving the teriiloty. They all sail], “Yon can’t do nothing in Sulphur, in Davi-, in Murray county. It’s hard territory.” We said we are hero to stay, so we will have to go see them. We have been over the county hou-e to house three times straight, and the towns in every' testimony period, and last spring a troupe of pioneers came into the county and they woiked it out, and the towns and business closely. Now there are a lot of people more or less interested, and several squarely on the Lord’s side. Several </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ft'alchtovy</span><span class="font4"> &lt;-.&lt; and GoMui </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ayas</span><span class="font4"> are earning here, and there ate even phonograph records to lie heard hereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If this sounds good to you, it may sound eten better when I toll you that not once lia\o we stopped (yes, ‘stop’ is right) to do so-called “preaching” (public speaking), and, what is more, we have done it rill jovially. Truly, the way the Lord has provided is the best way to witness the truth; and we are glad to du it Uis way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It Las been intensely interesting to me to watch the progress of the truth and the witnessing. The use of the radio, and then the tniii«cription machines, and now this little phonograph with the fcur-and-one-hali’-niinute records. And talk about a brief, pointed [testimony]: it looks like the last word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You know, in 1925, at Indianapolis convention, at a service meeting I Was asked to demom-tiate a ten-minute ••tarvass”. I completed in ten minutes without hurry, and was asked to repent, and did it again in the same time. When I returned home to Forth Worth I reduced that time in denioii.-tratiijg to seven minutes. And now you have me beat away yonder. When I beard that little record, so deliberate, so plain and so forceful and so much, 1 just heaved :&gt;. sigh uf joy'. What a boon to the worker! While they are reading the card one can be getting the phonograph ready, and while it is going they are deciding what they are going to do; and all so quick. Evon the card method alone is better than anything yet. The other Sunday we stopped at the first Louse. Sister went in. I booked our starting time. The witness was given and a placement made. We drove away', opcuing two gates, and were at the next house a quarter of a mile away in exactly ten minutes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">New York city Y.M.C.A., says in his annual report: “The serious problems of the depression did not begin with the stock market crash. They began when young men, who had been taught to think, found the doors of employment closed to them. They began when these young men found in a world of plenty they were unable to earn a living. This is a situation which cannot be solved by the bread line or the lodging house. It can be solved only by taking thought of the morrow for the youth of our country and endeavoring to adjust the economic structure so that it provides equal opportunity for all.”</span></p>

It is papered with stocks and bonds, gold-engraved and green-bordered, which have no value except as wall paper, but have a face value of about $1,000,000. Not a bad idea, and suggests a bridal chamber papered with marriage certificates and divorce decrees, and a Salvation Army barracks papered with college diplomas and church membership certificates. In these hard times everything has its uses. Undertakers’ parlors could be papered with automobile licenses and liquor permits.</span></p>

The municipal services, such as electricity and gas, expanded by leaps and bounds and were cheaper to the consumer than anywhere else in the world.”</span></p>

The plane carried twelve persons all the way, and fourteen persons part of the way, together with several hundred pounds of mail, air express, and baggage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HILE it is generally held that the Detroit bank collapse was caused by Coughlin’s radio activities, contributing factors are said to be that the bankers were paying 17-percent dividends even while their institutions were toppling, and 43 judges were aided by loans of $639,631 at a time when they might better have avoided the reception of such favors. The public got frightened and pulled out their deposits at a rate reaching up to one and a half million dollars a week.</span></p>

With her parents, a nurse and a grandmother the child was carried from Houston, Texas, to Baltimore in eleven hours, a distance of 1,400 miles. The aviator, James R. Wedell, made the trip through stormy skies, freezing weather and darkness, when air lines had been suspended because of bad weather, landing in Baltimore at 2: 00 a.m.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ERGENFIELD officials are gradually awakening to the fact that New Jersey is a part of the United States. They were helped recently by a decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court that the municipality’s ordinance requiring that permission of the police department be first obtained before handbills can be distributed to householders is unconstitutional. The court held the ordinance to be illegal because it vested discretionary powers in a chief of police and provided no rule of determination, except the wishes of the police, for allowing or denying the distribution, and the court held that this discretionary power is illegal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">EW YORK CITY operates several ferry lines. On these lines in the past eight years 318,579 persons have been given free rides because they were allegedly &quot;On City Business’. Thousands of the persons to whom the passes were issued, and who made use of them, were never connected with the city administration in any manner whatsoever. The passes got into the hands of such persons through the mayor’s office, the controller’s office, and through various judges, aidermen and other civic officials.</span></p>

Then they gave the snakes to the school where they are pupils, and the rest was easy.</span></p>

The copper cable between the towers is 1.4 inches in diameter, and hollow, the largest ever used.

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">EN students of Ohio State University refused military training, having taken their stand for a warless world. They endeavored to enlist the active assistance of the Columbus clergy to prevent their expulsion from the university. The Reverend John Miller, assistant pastor of the Indianola Avenue Presbyterian church, put the case for the ministers when he said it was their purpose “to quietly think about the matter but take no action”. In war time the dominies think noisily on the subject of war; in peace times they think quietly; on both occasions, and always, at heart they are for war.</span></p>

Now let us get this thing straight, so that we can know which god he is talking about (whether Jehovah, the God of eternity, or Satan, the Devil, the “god of this world”).</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It was 10:30 a.m., February 10, 1929, with the rain falling in torrents from leaden skies, that the pope, robed in white and wearing a gold tiara, and seated within his famous gestatorial chair, in which he was carried around by eight bearers, spilled the beans for us all by “blessing” the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We did not learn of this until June, when we said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We’re all sunk now, for it seems that just before the pope finished his deal with Mussolini to take over the temporal power and a goodsized chunk of the money which America recently loaned to Italy, in a moment of thoughtlessness he blessed the whole world. And, mind you, this is after all those airplanes blessed by the pope and bishops have landed at the bottom of the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ever since that time the world has had nothing but hard luck, and we can’t help but feel that the pope wished it all on us when he blessed us. But now that we have got it, why blame God for it, when the Devil is really the one at fault?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE differences of Chicago ministers on the question of fundamentals confirm Judge Rutherford’s charge that the clergy are not really fundamental, but either reactionary or unfaithful and faithless. The survey of 1,039 clergymen listed with Chicago Church Federation revealed the fact that the majority of the pastors of that representative city hold views that are thoroughly unscriptural. The existence of the Devil is denied by 54 percent; the existence of angels, by 60 percent; the existence of heaven, by 59 percent; and of a judgment day, by 39 percent; while belief in the unscriptural doctrine of inherent immortality is professed by 92 percent. Sixty-seven percent of the ministers hold beliefs in evolution that are not supported or warranted by Scripture. Their views on hell are fully as unscriptural as their other opinions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Uncle Sam to do this or that for such and such a price; that has often been done. But in March an old-time and unskillful thief robbed a showcase containing $75 in gold coins; it was directly in front of the cashier’s office, and immediately above the treasury vault, where millions of dollars in gold and paper are kept. The thief got away without disturbing any of the police or watchmen guarding the nation’s wealth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Reign of Terror in Poland</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">AYS Charles Edward Russell: “In Poland, for many months now, the Jews have lived, if at all, under a reign of terror. In many towns and cities Jews have cowered in their houses, not daring to appear upon the streets. If one was seen anywhere the sight was the signal for a riot. Thousands of Jews have been beaten; some have been killed. All Jewish stores have been looted or closed. Jewish workmen have been unable to pursue their vocations. Whole Jewish communities are literally starving. Jewish children have been driven from the schools; Jewish students, from the universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Members of an anti-Semitic society have armed themselves with sticks having razor blades at the end, and with these have attacked, and slashed, Jewish fugitives. Other detachments have traveled to and fro on railroad trains looking for Jewish passengers, and beating any they have been able to find. Trains have been stopped between stations, and Jews driven from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Three Gentiles were mistaken for Jews and nearly beaten to death, one of them a public officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A funeral procession was organized to do honor to an anti-Semite killed in a drunken and riotous attack upon a Jewish house. As it went along, cursing the Jews, there was an explosion, and one of the marchers fell, badly wounded. Instantly arose the cry that he had been shot by Jews, and extensive raids were planned to hunt the Jews from their hiding-places.

This started the suspicions of the police, and he confessed that he had been carrying a hand grenade to use against the Jews and it had prematurely exploded.”</span></p>

It is believed (by some) that this measure is aimed at Nazi propaganda, but it is appreciated by others that it is intended to keep out Jehovah’s witnesses with their testimony that the kingdom of God is the hope of the world. Many New Jersey towns have persistently subjected these messengers of peace to every kind of indignity and inconvenience.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The argument that it is genuine is based on Mark 15:17, which reads, “And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head.” Everybody who can reason must know that the purple which was put on Jesus at that time was nothing that Mary made for Him, but was a garment borrowed for the occasion and intended to mock His claim of royalty.</span></p>

Through the Lonza Company, Switzerland, the French apostles of Big Business supplied Germany with huge quantities of glycerin for explosives, nickel, copper, oil and rubber for other military purposes. Germany ■was equally obliging. Every month 150,000 tons of scrap iron, steel or barbed wire were shipped into France via Switzerland. One family of armament makers, called the “de Wendels” in France and called the “von Wendels” in Germany, supervised these exchanges. Their control over both the French and German governments was so great that gunfire was carefully directed away from their ammunition factories on both sides of the line. England was affiliated with both sides, through the Vickers company. In rural England is a cannon captured from a German regiment. On one side of the cannon are engraved the names of the British soldier lads that were killed by it; on the other side is engraved the name of the British concern, the Vickers Company, that made the gun.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>“Of Thee I Sing”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">(Reprinted from the St. Paul </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News) </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mr.</span><span class="font8"> W. H. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dewar</span><span class="font8"> is a Y.M.C.A. secretary of Canadian birth who was anxious to become an American citizen. Appearing before Judge Alfred A. Stein, in Elizabeth, N. J., he was asked to present a written statement giving his position in regard to war and peace. This he did in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I have no reservation whatsoever about bearing arms in defense of the country. Should the government, however, undertake war ‘for the solution of international controversy’ I could not guarantee now what my conscience might dictate under such circumstances, or should the government enter any war that is used ‘as an instrument of national policy’ in expressing our relations with another nation I could not give assurance now as to what my position might be at such a time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In presenting his statement to the judge Mr. Dewar called attention to the fact that the quotations were taken directly from the Kellogg peace pact. Nevertheless Judge Stein said that on the basis of previous decisions he would have to deny Mr. Dewar’s application for citizenship. According to the Kellogg pact the United States has renounced war as an instrument of national policy. But it objects, apparently, to having its prospective citizens do so. We have one position, it seems, for consumption abroad and another for home use. No wonder people by the thousands are going to the New York musical comedy “Of Thee I Sing” to roar at their own government. As one reviewer put it, “The play is funnier than the government, and a lot less dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A parallel of the above occurred during the World War, in Wisconsin. A professor of economics told his class that Liberty bonds were not worth their face value, and he was arrested and tried for sedition and admitted making the statement. He was fined $300, and offered three $100 Liberty bonds in payment of his fine. They were refused on the ground that they were not worth $300; so his friends made up the difference in cash. “Consistency, thou art a jewel.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Whosoever shall break one of these commandments and teach men so, he shall be outlawed from the select circle and knifed in the back; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be great in the kingdom of Babylon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mother’s Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">ITH “Mother’s Day” demanding the attention of the people, it is appropriate at this season to consider to what extent such an observance is either proper or desirable. Doubtless many mothers would prefer that the attentions showered upon them on one day in the year might be a little more evenly and consistently distributed over the rest of the year, and there have not been wanting voices that have decried as both sentimental and hypocritical the practice of setting aside one day in the year for the purpose of rendering special homage to mothers, with “Father’s Day” coming in as a weak and half-hearted second. Particularly apt and moderate are Judge Rutherford’s comments on this subject. We give herewith a brief extract from his book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> (I), pages 157-160:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every good man loves his wife, his mother and his sisters, and is kind and considerate to all women; but that does not mean that he should put women in a place contrary to the expressed will of God. In the church of God the man represents Christ the Head, while the woman pictures the bride of Christ, that is submissive to the Head. The divine rule is this: “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.” “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it. ” (1 Corinthians 11: 3; Ephesians 5: 23-25) Satan would reverse this rule and put the women to the front. He begins his reform work by first deceiving and misleading the women, and then appeals to the so-called “gentlemanly” qualities of man to submit to his subtle scheme. The modern practice of putting women to the fore in the affairs of religion and in the councils of state has much to do with destroying the sacredness of the home and with turning men away from God. Thus Satan has deceived and led the men and women in the wrong way, in order to turn them away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let it always be kept in mind that the policy of Satan is to turn the people away from the Creator, and to accomplish his purposes he uses divers and numerous schemes, many of which on the face of them seem to be entirely right and proper. God commands: “Honour thy father and thy mother.” (Exodus 20:12) He did not command, however, that the father should be excluded. The father represents Jehovah, from whom comes every good thing, while the mother represents God’s organization, used for His good purposes and to His glory. (Isaiah 54:5; 66:8; Psalm 50:20) Satan would turn the people away from this beautiful symbol, and therefore from God, and cause them to disregard the Word of the Lord. This he does in a very subtle way by organizing what in England and in America, the chief countries of “Christendom”, is called “Mother’s Day”. This day began to be observed in England, in 1913. That same year the United States Congress, by resolution, made the second Sunday in May of each year a national holiday, “dedicated to the memory of the best mother in the world, your mother.” That sounds nice, and on the face of it looks nice; but is it sincere? and what is the real purpose thereof? Do the men of England and America love their mothers better since 1914 than they did before? Certainly not. Is it true that every man’s mother is the “best mother in the world”? Everyone knows that is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The so-called “Mother’s Day” was observed in America first in 1914, the very year that Satan’s world ended and when he knew his time was short to get ready for the great battle of Armageddon. To induce the people to bestow special honor and worship upon mothers would be one step towards turning the people away from the worship of God; and this is one of his means of preparing for Armageddon. In all the churches today much is made over “Mother’s Day’’, but in not a single one of them are the people ever told that God is the Father, and that the “mother” is His organization, and that all honor and worship is due to Jehovah God. On the contrary, the men of “Christendom” are taught to pay their honor to creatures, and not to the Creator; and this by the clergymen, whose duty and obligation is to teach the people the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the face of it the arrangement of “Mother’s Day ’ ’ seems harmless and calculated to do good. But the people are in ignorance of Satan’s subtle hand in the matter, and that he is back of the movement, to turn the people away from God. The slogan is: “The best mother who ever lived”; the purpose being to establish creature worship, or at least to divert the attention of man from the proper worship of God. There have been many good mothers of men, and many bad ones. Not every man has the best mother that ever lived; and therefore the slogan is false. The woman that dishonors Jehovah God and blasphemes His name is not a good woman, regardless of how many children she may bear; whereas some of her children may be faithful servants of God. The good mother is the one who serves and honors Jehovah and teaches her children to do likewise, and who renders her proper motherly duties in the home. Real men have great respect and great love for sueh mothers, but their worship is given to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neither the man nor the woman should be worshiped for doing right, because such doing of right is their duty. Creature worship of any kind is wrong and an abomination in the sight of God.—Luke 16:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. In like manner the cbaliee also, after he had supped, saying : This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.” (Luke 22:19, 20) “Jesus said to them: . . . Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you, are spirit and life.” (John 6:54,64) “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” —Romans 8: 9.</span></p>

Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.” (Hebrews 10:12,14,18) “Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dicth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him. For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.” (Romans 6: 9,10) “For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest . . . who needeth not daily to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself. ”—Hebrews </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7:</span><span class="font7">26,27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Wrestling with the Catechism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By A.L.S. (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font8">HRISTENED and raised a Catholic, I had gone to the Catholic school for eight years, and won several Catechism contests. When through school I never missed a mass on Sundays or holidays for practically five years. Then my friend received the truth and presented me with a Bible and book, which I studied. Naturally, my parents and I being Catholic, it was very hard for me to decide which had the most truth. I picked out some of the texts that I read in a booklet, such as were different from my belief and would talk to different priests on the subject in order to settle differences, only to find myself more confused. Several instances I will mention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I said to the priest that as Catholics we were taught that at death the soul leaves the body, and if in the state of mortal sin it goes to hell and cannot get out; “Is that right?” I asked. He said “Yes”. Then I asked him to explain the fact that “hell delivered up the dead which were in [it]” (Revelation 20:13), which proves that they are dead; also, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) In connection therewith, I asked about the resurrection of the body, if the soul was in hell and couldn’t get out to join the body. The answer was very unsatisfactory, that the body joins the soul. I certainly can’t see the sense of having a resurrection of the body if the soul is already in a destined place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then I said, “God is without beginning or end, how could Mary be called the mother of God? Point that out from the Scriptures.” I then received a bitter calling down, the priest saying, “How long have you gone to the Catholic school?” (he probably thinking, only a short time and I never understood the doctrines) When I told him “Eight years”, he said he was surprised that I never accepted the traditions of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In their traditions I never learned the beautiful name Jehovah appeared in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I quit the church about two and a half years ago, and have learned more reading some of your publications than in the thirteen years of Catholic training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have attended quite a few talks given by representatives, who were sent to the Cincinnati company, and enjoyed them very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May the Lord bless you in your work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">At “Church” on Mother’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T HAVE gone to church for the last time on -*• Mother’s Day! Shocked? Not so much, as I only echo the voice of hundreds of women who assume a quaker attitude of motherhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having on my very best, with twin carnations, red and white, to represent one mother dead and a more than mother living (I double up without any falsity about it), I proceed into the church bedecked with flowers, hundreds of them. Directed to a place roped off, I march up the aisle to low music. Thoughts come to one in church which at any other time find no lodgment. How much like sheep we were, so docile-looking. Most of us mothers had on new things and were not over the feel of them, which only added to our discomfort. Some began to weep before we were well corralled and, poor hearts, never ceased until the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a few well-chosen words “Mother McCrea” came on. Oh my—though perhaps Mother McCrea was a jolly little butterball—her name sounds it, and perhaps she made cookies. Sure, I cried, too. I really didn’t know what Mother McCrea had done, but the voice was beautiful. (Poor Henry Boy, my non-shrinkable gloves were a present from him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prayer was wonderful for words; but the length! Mothers are a busy bunch and can’t sit idle too long. And what a lot of mothers in the Bible! I mean good ones. I had to go home to look up the ones not so good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To begin with, Adam’s wife wasn’t so much. Lot’s wife was rather fresh, and liked the swift crowd. Jacob’s wife No. 1 had a jealous spirit. Also, we must not forget poor old Job’s “better half”. All these had to balance the blessed Han-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Day </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By a Human Mother</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">nah and others, but some way or other they had fairly good sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I bowed my head with embarrassment at the astonishing tribute paid to present mothers, tribute which should have been paid to God. In fact, God was off the map on Mother’s Day; clear off. But then, of course, God can get on again sometime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Did you know that the Lord had a fine chance to start Mother’s Day away back there? He was teaching the people of God’s kingdom, and some one whispered ‘Here is your mother’. But did He stop preaching? No, He only said, “Who is my mother?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And oh, the beautiful fairy stories of wonderful mothers! Whenever did they live? I recalled my darling mother’s round laughing face, the very picture of my daughter. Nothing saintly about her; just alive with joy and goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I blushed as the man went on. We mothers were a standard to follow, a rock of defense, a tower of strength, religious leaders, a pattern which all time would not alter. We represented purity, honesty, to be worshiped, loved, reverenced, etc., etc. (Why should my thoughts travel across eighteen states to the ‘Goddess of Liberty’, pure, white, beautiful, but lifeless?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Was I glad my boys had a date and my girl a cold? I could not face just now the roguish faces of my tribe; for I am not in the comparison. They know who and what I am: mother by nature, sister by adoption, pal by choice. My ups and downs are just like theirs. My advice is good only because of experience, but even that, in this day of increased knowledge, is </span><span class="font9">not </span><span class="font8">so greatly needed. My children know I have </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font8">temper like they have, and, with them, trying to conquer it. They know I am not an angel and never will be, dead or alive. I say “darn” and stop at the other “d” as they do. When they do things unwisely I tell them how their father did the same tiling. Our dad rather frowns at that, though. I let the boys know how he pulled himself out of the slump, and the strength it gave him to “never again”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I don’t grow a long face when things go wrong. I get a red face, as angry nearly as they do, and we have the first round, but never a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We reverence Jehovah and His Son, and no one else, not even mothers. My children are never going to find me out: they know me from the start. They know that Dad and Mother do many wrong things, and that we reap what we sow, and so will they.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mothers are mothers from choice; and just as you chose your life job, so I chose mine. Maybe mine is more important, but, after all, the thing is to do it well, whatever it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I shall never forget the first time my dear mother No. 1 said “darn”. She taught me many things in after years, but nothing so delighted me as the “darn”. Why? Because I knew then that mother was one of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no use, dear “reverends”, placing us upon your platforms by the side or in the place of God. It can’t be and isn’t done. You should extol Jehovah, and then, instead of roped-in, w<sup>T</sup>eeping Rachels, you would have rejoicing Marys and Elizabeths. Or else leave the mothers in the kitchens; they love it there, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I want no wall of wailing when I go hence; and there won’t be, as the wall is already down, and my children see on the other side. Mothers, mothers on every side of the road, and instead of weeping for themselves they will bear messages of joy here and another joy to the mother there, to the motherless and to those who never knew the joy of motherhood—that will be a true mother’s day, every day, anywhere, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mothers of today are but the girls of yesterday. Why halo them? And in the words of my boys, “Goodnight!” veying to the people information concerning the general welfare would be a contravention of the fundamental laws of liberty which the early American patriots were careful to set forth. Obviously it is a matter of duty for the present representatives of the people at the nation’s capital to make some specific provision for liberty of the radio as their forebears did for liberty of the press and freedom of speech. Legislation that definitely safeguards against the restriction of free radio should be the first concern of the lawmaking body in considering ways and means of properly regulating the use of this medium of publicity. Provision should be made to prevent vested interests from monopolizing the essentially and fundamentally public utility for private ends. Discrimination and interference with the free use of this instrument by responsible and reasonable persons should be carefully proscribed. It should be the privilege of anyone who is able to provide the monetary means to bring to the attention of the people whatever message is, in his opinion, of sufficient interest and importance to warrant his spending time, effort and means in order to give it publicity, regardless of who he is. The very same guarantees that are made for the liberty of speech and of the press inevitably extend to the free use of the radio. This use should be limited only to the extent that an impartial and fair distribution of time and facilities demands, but to arbitrarily exclude an individual or organization from giving adequate publicity to its work, its message and its objectives, is manifestly a violation not only of fundamental American law, but of the divine law of equity and justice.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Congress Shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the Constitution of the United States was framed the political leaders and representatives of the people took particular precautions to insure freedom of religion, freedom of speech and a free press. These were considered, and truly are, fundamental factors in assuring that the people shall have proper liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1791, provided that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances”. Before this, in 1776, four states, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and North Carolina, all adopted what are considered the earliest legislative declarations in favor of liberty of the press, and as early as 1768 a legislative body in the state of Massachusetts declined to back up Governor Bernard in efforts to inflict punishment upon a publisher for what he was pleased to consider a libel of his honor. The legislature in question declared that “the liberty of the press is a great bulwark</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Make No Law—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the liberty of the people. It is therefore the incumbent duty of those who are constituted the guardians of the people’s rights to defend and maintain it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The assurances of liberty of speech and of the press, as well as of religion and the right of the people peaceably to assemble, have constituted bulwarks of liberty unequaled in other lands, and it has been pointed out that as a result of these foundation principles the United States has grown to be a great nation. It is unquestionably true that these fundamental provisions for personal liberty have played an important part in the progress of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the time the foregoing legislative provisions were made there was no radio, nor was such a revolutionary and unheard-of invention even vaguely imagined. But radio is now an important factor in the life of the nation and its people. As an instrument of publicity, communication and broadcasting information it is nothing short of a divine provision, and rivals the influence and power of the public press. Its use for worthy ends is therefore a matter of greatest importance. To shackle this means of con-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The provision for freedom of religion in the United States has enabled the Roman hierarchy to grow to an extent not possible for it in any other land. It has laid hold of the accouterments of freedom for its own ends and has prospered in considerable degree. It is astounding now to see this organization turn against the very arrangements that have enabled it to increase in a land and under conditions which are fundamentally contrary to its inherent nature. The air of freedom and the environment of equality and liberty have caused it to thrive until now it begins to inoculate the very atmosphere in which it prospered with the stifling vapors of its inveterate hatred of true liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman hierarchy, successor to Pagan Rome and not to early Christianity, has come out into the open and revealed itself as the deadly foe of truth, sincerity, equality and liberty. It mistakenly deems itself sufficiently powerful now to show itself in its true colors and to begin to impose its will on the vast majority of the people. By no means all who call themselves Catholic are in harmony with the policies, activities and objectives of the Hierarchy, which arrogates to itself the power to rule them. The Roman hierarchy is therefore not representative even of the 20 millions who are counted as Catholics. Millions of these are only mildly interested in the Hierarchy. What holds them is the mistaken and unanalyzed notion that in some way the Hierarchy, in spite of all its contradictions to Christianity, is still the outstanding supporter of Christian truth. Nothing could be farther from the facts, and even a cursory examination of the gospels and epistles will reveal the fundamental difference between the teachings of Christ and the teachings and dogmas of the imposing autocratic organization which claims to be His sole representative. The Hierarchy, then, is representative of a foreign power rather than of an influential minority in the United States. At all events, it is certain that it represents (and misrepresents) only a minority of the people of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now what does this essentially undemocratic organization endeavor to accomplish? Ostensibly it seeks to exclude from the air a person who is objectionable to the “religious sensibilities of Catholics”. Judge Rutherford is made the victim in this case. But it is not merely an individual that is involved in this matter. No one knows better than the members of that consummately subtle political machine, the Roman hierarchy, that the individual is in this case merely the tangible factor in a struggle which involves the fundamental principles upon which the government of the United States was built, and also the definitely contrary principles underlying the activities of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is a fight and a controversy which involves issues that go far beyond the visible factors. It is a controversy in which no intelligent human creature can be neutral. It is a case of being for or against truth, fairness, justice and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy represents the ultimate in the contradictions of true liberty. It is the absolute rule of a small class of ecclesiastical lords over the minds, the hearts, the consciences, the goods, the bodies and even the souls of the masses, who are to all intents abject slaves. The effects of its dominance over the masses are demonstrated in the Inquisition, the memory of which still makes the blood run cold and draws a pall of blackest darkness over the already gloomy history of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is this thing, this execrable power for evil and misery, that is seeking to lay hold of and suppress the free institutions of a free people, and to arrest the progress of truth and righteousness in a land where the opportunities and privileges of the masses have been most conducive to the general enlightenment and welfare of the people. It is seeking to establish itself in a land where its success would mean a complete reversal of the principles and policies that have for more than a century and a half governed the course of the people. In lands where it has held undisputed sway it is anathema with the more progressive and liberty-loving citizens, and even those whose abject subjection has until now been unquestioned are beginning to see a measure of light and to break away from the thraldom in which they have been held. It is a monstrous contradiction, an unprecedented example of the arrogance, temerity and ruthlessness of the hierarchy of Rome to now attempt the gradual subjection of the most libertyloving people on the face of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the Hierarchy, Judge Rutherford is only a pawn, though an important one, in the game which they are playing, and in which the stakes are power and influence of ever increasing proportions for the Hierarchy. Shall the radio be throttled? That is the question. Or shall the radio, like the press, be a medium for the free discussion of all subjects that directly or indirectly affect the public welfare ? A provision to assure its free untrammeled use is unquestionably one of the most important pieces of legislation that have been considered by the American Congress in a long time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">IME marches on, and the world, in place of making progress upward and onward, finds “Things Are Upside Down”, to use the caption of an editorial appearing in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star, </span><span class="font8">which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Canada, in all the western world, there is abundance and the efforts of governments is to cheek plenty and produce scarcity. The effort is to increase the cost -of living so that nobody may be in want. The whole thing gives one the impression that everything is upside down and wrong end first. When Captain Philpott makes a speech and declares that a new era must begin some people in Toronto speak of him as a visionary and say that it is but necessary for everybody to sit tight and everything will come out all right as has always been the case before. But Captain Philpott and others who speak in Ontario and the west are not alone in holding the views they do. Thomas F. Woodlock, editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal,</span><span class="font7"> is quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am no prophet, but I know this is no cycle, no mere interruption in the orderly processes of economics. It is a tremendous turning point, the end of an era which has lasted for centuries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking in the House of Commons in London a short time ago Lord Eustace Percy said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">With one hundred thousand men, women and children on direct relief in Toronto, with taxes rising, with tariffs never changing except to go higher and vexatious new interferences with international trading being introduced almost every day as the opportunity to go from bad to worse presents itself—what can result but explosions which will change the face of things? Between Canada and the United States we have thousands of miles of unarmed frontier, and if this were marked by a chain of mountains we would work from both sides drilling tunnels so that we can trade back and forth with each other. But, having no mountains, we have erected artificial difficulties to trading more forbidding than mountains. The ingenuity of man could overcome the worst of material difficulties, but the same ingenuity of man enables the lawmaker to dissipate the benefits that should flow from the successes of the engineers. We build the Hudson Bay route at heavy cost to facilitate trade with the world, and then hoist tariffs to prevent trade with the world.

<h3><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Disposing of the Rights of the People</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">At a gathering of hundreds of citizens of Ontario to do honor to the chief justice of the province on the occasion of his 90th birthday he took advantage of the assembly to attack both the Dominion and provincial legislatures. We quote in part an editorial appearing in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chief justice next attacked what he called the ever-increasing practice of the parliament of Canada and of the provincial legislatures of appointing commissions vested with autocratic powers which deprive the people of the protection of the law and of the courts. Laying the blame on no political party, he declaimed against “shutting the doors of the duly constituted courts of justice against any citizen, rich or poor, high or low, and in thus leaving his legal rights at the mercy of nonjudicial bodies, often ignorant of the law, bound by no law, free to disregard the evidence and the law, and practically at its own will to dispose finally of his rights’’. He spoke of “literally many hundreds of boards and officers in Canada today authorized to exercise arbitrary power in dealing with the liberty and property of the citizens’’. These boards he represented as conducting their proceedings behind closed doors, as giving no reasons for their decisions, and as leaving the wronged suitor without redress or right of appeal. Appealing to the spirit of John Hampden, he demanded the restoration of the people’s rights. “Let this invasion of the people ’s rights continue, and the ultimate result must be despotism, a Frankenstein; we shall cease to be a free people, and our condition will be like that of unhappy Russia, not like that of England of old.’’ His lordship specifies no particular commissions to which he takes exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his closing sentences, Sir William appealed to the members of the bar to keep alive the torch of health and honor and true fellowship, the torch of joy in everything that enriches life, and to pass it on to their successors. The prize of that achievement he declared is within the grasp of every man.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Snuffling Up the Prairie Air</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Many interested in the question of the western provinces’ seceding from Canada will be interested in the following item from the Edmonton </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Godly Toronto, where most of the professional agencies for interfering with personal liberty have their headquarters, now has something of its own to investigate. Officials of the city relief office questioned before a Parliamentary committee divulge that in scores of cases the department is paying out relief to augment the sweatshop wages paid to men with families to support. They range from $11 a week for 48 hours’ work to $5 a week for one poor wretch who had to work 88 hours to earn his miserable five dollars. That’s a case where three months in prison might be better justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth is, despite what one of the eastern premiers in his ignorance stated before the recent conference of premiers, that the east lives on the west, not the west upon the east. When people wake up to realize the enormous amounts they pay to bonus the east, the movement for the independence of the western provinces will get a great impetus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take motor cars alone. Each of the western provinces has roughly about 100,000 motor vehicles on the road. Each owner paid on an average not less than $400 more than the world market price for his car in order to help the eastern manufacturer. That comes to a bonus of $4,000,000 from each western province. The same thing applies in greater or less degree on everything we touch, taste or handle from the cradle to the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the eastern provinces were able to see things clearly, they’d realize that they have need to agitate for reflation of our currency. It isn’t just a matter of the poor western farmer's being hard hit by “sound money’’. When the western farmer is hard hit, the east loses its best customer. The remedy for sweatshop evils in Toronto is a reflated currency, so that the western farmer can be a better buyer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Artificial Weather Not the Best</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">According to a research conducted by Thomas G. How, science graduate of the University of British Columbia, air conditioning produced by modern ventilating and heating systems is not necessarily best for one’s health. A Central Press report in this connection says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How has constructed an apparatus for measuring the number of ions in the atmosphere and showing how weather changes affect the quantity. Results to date seem to prove that hot, sunny weather and heavy downpours of rain both bring an abundance of the groups of molecules which have a vital influence on health, while light rains cause a scarcity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since an increase in the number of ions in the air tends to aggravate rheumatism, How’s findings supply a scientific foundation for grandmother’s “feeling rain in her bones”. She didn’t know it, but her prophecies were due to an oversupply of ions, which affected both the rheumatism and the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radium and X-rays both cause air to break up artificially into ions. Cosmic rays, which shoot into the earth’s atmosphere from interstellar spaces have the same effect and are responsible for approximately one-third of the ions present. The remaining two-thirds are due to radioactive minerals and gases. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font7">the open sea it has been observed that there are few ions. This is explained by the fact that air over the sea is not subject to influence by radioactive minerals, but only by cosmic rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These electrically charged particles are one of the most vitalizing elements of air. In his university experiments, How found that in mechanical ventilating systems about 30 percent of the ions are absorbed in the metal and wasted, while practically all of them are lost if the air is washed. It results in “deadened” air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This University of B.C. student is engaged in counting the ions in a given volume of air and comparing the result, day by day, as the weather changes. The particles are invisible and infinitesimally small, so counting them presented a real problem. He solved it by constructing an ingenious homemade apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air is drawn into a lengthy funnel by an electric fan and its exact quantity is measured by an automatic indicator. If he wants to measure the positive ions, he charges positively a rod inside the funnel in order to draw off the negative ions. The positive ions are conducted into a globe somewhat similar to a radio tube, which receives the electric current and amplifies it. The current is measured on a delicate instrument.

<p><span class="font8">Concerning the rapidly disappearing right of freedom of speech the last-quoted paper says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is interesting to be told by Mr. Leo Gallagher that speech is freer in Canada than in Soviet Russia or in Nazi Germany. It is also freer here than in Fascist Italy. But is this a sufficient boast for a democratic country in the new world? No pretense is made by the Soviets or the Fascists or the Nazis that speech is free. “Liberty,” cried Mussolini, “is dead and rotting in her grave. ’ ’ It was democracy that introduced freedom of speech into the world, and in the world democracy now alone defends it. The countries which adhere to democracy are today few in number, and, of them all, Britain is the outstanding example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The province of Quebec is the latest portion of the earth to discard the wisdom of the nineteenth century and revert to the practices of the eighteenth. The government in Quebec proposes, in a bill about to be passed, to forbid the holding of any public meeting without the consent of the chief of police, or, where there is no such official, without the consent of the mayor or head of the municipality. And no person is to be allowed to print or circulate a call for a public meeting without first securing the approval and consent of the masters of the people, the authorities, the chief of police or the mayor. We would like to suggest to members of the Empire Club of Toronto and to editors of some newspapers in the province who have read the speech of Mr. R. L. Calder, K.C., on this Quebec bill that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font7"> has for three or four years been engaged in fighting against the introduction here in Toronto, without a shred of law to justify it, the same system which Quebec now proposes to put into effect by statute. The proposed action of Quebec is to be deplored as belonging more to fascism and dictatorship than to democracy, but we have been opposing in Toronto something worse—the same thing being done, not on the authority of a statute passed by the legislature, but by a police activity in daily defiance of all existing statutes and laws of the province and the dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must forever remain to us a mystery that so many people, with the long history of freedom as Britons have worked it out available to them, are indifferent as to what happens to it. In Ontario it is whittled away by inches; Quebec proposes to chop it off by the yard. No doubt Quebec is trying to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men say: “Speech is perfectly free if people want to say what they ought to say, and the freedom of speech of nobody is interfered with except that of those who want to say what they should not say.” No tyrant of any age said other than that. If a man must say what everybody else agrees with there is no need for him to speak unless he is running for aiderman. All the progress mankind has made has been due to a minority saying, and repeating, that which the ruling forces did not want said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Paris, in Vienna and in London within a fortnight great multitudes assembled in protest against conditions—in Paris and Vienna the authorities in a panic of alarm swung armed forces into action to scatter the multitudes and smash into subjection the discontents of the public. Heavy casualties resulted. In London the police were present, as ever, not as enemies of the assembled citizens, but only to see that life and property were not attacked. The police had nothing to do with thought and opinion on any subject under the sun. London passed the thing along quietly. This is not the first nor the tenth time that London has looked on peaceably and seen that which on the continent has swollen into revolution. The London attitude toward a protesting multitude is, “Go on, if you have a complaint, tell England what it is.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present discontent in Britain is great. Vast numbers are unemployed, there are many who would make trouble if they could, but John Bull does not go half way to meet them in making trouble. He seeks, as long as he can, to avert it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The terrible condition prevailing in asylums in Newfoundland is revealed in the following news item appearing in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Charging neglect of duty, intoxication and loose administration of poisonous drugs against certain members of the staff of the poor asylum and Newfoundland infirmary here, Magistrate A. Vateher recommends dismissal of “the present staff nurse, the day nurse, all male attendants and so-called ‘probation’ nurses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The strongly worded findings, made after an extensive investigation into administration of the institution, condemns the conduct of members of the staff and charges the male superintendent spent much of his time in the matron's room, often behind locked doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report said its author found the staff nurse “was fond of drink and a good time generally”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“She had men in her rooms at all hours of the day and night,” the report continues, “and not infrequently all night. They have been known to leave showing signs of intoxication, and evidence from several sources points to the fact she drinks habitually and sometimes has been the worse for liquor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Inmates, meanwhile, were left in care of the night watchman, according to the report, and men were left to die, attendants seeing them only when ready for burial. The report also suggests goods were removed from the institution, while one witness swore he had seen an attendant remove money from the purse of a dying inmate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brandy, morphine, heroin and strychnine were used a “great deal” in the institution, Magistrate Vateher reported, and were handled in a careless manner without any interest being taken to ascertain whether they were “used or not”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The visiting physician was alleged to have neglected visiting certain parts of the asylum, and the male superintendent was said to have returned often at night to be entertained at parties by the matron, “remaining until late hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Emphasizing the “disgraceful” treatment in feeding patients, the commissioner said bread was cut thick to economize on butter and “the blind had to feel very carefully to find which side was buttered”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” the report said, “like poor dumb animals, the patients never had anyone to whom they could complain. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Every once in a while we become so immersed in our present problems we forget there were other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When that happens, the thing to do is to have the following choice gem alongside you. The Vancouver </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font7"> ran across this two years ago and published it. But in case you missed it, here it is again. Clip it out and paste it alongside your desk. It’s as good as a tonie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The excerpt is from London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Truth,</span><span class="font7"> published 45 years ago:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has begun to launch its bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This railway, if it be ever finished, will run through a country frost-bound for seven or eight months of the year, and will connect with the eastern part of the Dominion a province which embraces about as forbidding country as any on the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“British Columbia is a barren, cold, mountain country, that is not worth keeping. It would never have been inhabited at all unless by trappers of the Hudson Bay Company, had the ‘gold fever’ not taken a party of mining adventurers there.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Surplus Braid and Brass Hats</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It might be surprising to many who think of Canada as a country of peace and good will to read the following editorial found in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A story is told of a distinguished Frenchman who visited Toronto two or three months ago being asked at a small social gathering why it is that Europe, after her experiences, still goes in for militarism. The visitor professed to be astonished at the question. “Why,” he said, “I have seen more evidences of militarism here in Toronto on my present visit than I have seen in any European city for years past. I have seen here military funerals, military church parades with military bands playing war marches, smart cadet corps in uniforms and boys parading with wooden guns. This seems to be quite a military city.” The Toronto people present tried to explain to the visitor how things were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a recent issue of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Magazine</span><span class="font7"> was an article by Thomas Wayling entitled “The Brass Hat Parade, or What Price Disarmament?” The article complains that brass hats are on parade in Canada now from coast to coast. “There are now,” it says, “permanently employed three major-generals, eleven brigadiers, twelve full colonels, thirty-two lieutenantcolonels, sixty-nine majors, ninety captains, and seventy-four lieutenants. These figures include fortyeight officers who wear the red tab and gold lace of the staff officer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These figures, like the statement made by the distinguished French visitor to the city, will surprise Toronto people. Here is another excerpt from the article in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Magazine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘In the middle of the war, December 31, 1916, Canada had 4,452 officers and 104,251 other ranks in France; so said Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Currie in his report of 1918. In 1932, after fifteen years of peace, the Dominion had 5,226 officers and 34,300 other ranks in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In the thick of the war, in the midst of the most desperate conflict ever waged, Canada had in the field one officer to every twenty-four men. Now in the days of peace she has one officer to every seven men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another statement is that Canada has disarmed the rank and file—she has only 3,300 men in her permanent force and 31,000 in the active militia, but senior officers abound. Today the chief of the general staff is a major-general and there are forty-eight staff officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The impression one gets from the article from which we have quoted is that Canada has far more brass hats than her condition and her peace-loving character call for.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>Sweatshop Conditions in Toronto</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Recently Parliament appointed a committee to investigate the matters of mass-buying, pricespreads and wage conditions in general, and startling indeed have been the findings. We quote from an Ottawa news dispatch appearing in the Edmonton </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sweatshop conditions in Toronto industries were pictured yesterday to the Stevens committee of the House of Commons, investigating labor and general business practices. A. W. Laver, welfare commissioner for Toronto, told of firms paying $5, $6 and up to $10 to heads of families for a full week’s work, forcing them to appeal to the city for partial relief in order to pay their rent and buy food and clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few minutes after Richard Stapels, ehairman of the Ontario minimum wage board, told how employers dodged the law by hiring girls only a few hours a day in the rush hours and refused to pay minimum wages, the Toronto welfare commissioner gave some concrete illustrations of law evasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Laver instanced the National Picture Frame and Art Company, which, he said, fired 17 girls who were receiving minimum wages of $12.50 a week and hired men and boys who were outside the minimum wage law provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men with families of four children were paid $9 a week, 15 cents an hour for nine hours, and single men and boys, 10 and 12 cents an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chain stores and the needle trade were the worst offenders in Toronto in paying low wages, Mr. Laver said. When firms paid less than minimum wages as defined by law, no reports were made to provincial authorities, for fear the employees would be discharged in retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Low wages were reflected three ways on Toronto civic taxation, said Mr. Laver. Relief costs were increased last year to $6,686,900; hospitalization costs jumped to $1,350,000 because people could not pay themselves and scores of families sought to have their children become wards of the city. Last year Toronto spent $236,000 maintaining its wards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Special men were employed to fight cases in the courts where impoverished parents sought to hand over their children to city institutions rather than seo them starve and go practically naked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Selected at random from a list of 1,455 families who were paid partial relief in Toronto because of low wages—in each case the wage earner worked full time —Mr. Laver instanced 41 men and women receiving from $4 to $10 for a full week’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have found instances of girls being discharged and men with families taken on at lower wages. These men are receiving such a low rate of pay the city has had to come to their assistance and give them relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the same committee report Quebec girls have been forced to work in the needle trade for as little as $2.00 per week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If commerce is not controlled by the Devil, then by whom is it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well might the citizens of the sweatshop city of Toronto pray to Jehovah for relief from such conditions; but under the guidance of the “blind leaders of the blind” they pray to their god, “the god of this world,” for relief, and, of course, can find none. Note the following news item appearing in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire</span><span class="font8"> of Toronto:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Wet batteries from automobiles are used to operate a barbed-wire telephone service, providing 50 miles of “fence phone’’. The man at the end of the line is connected with the government telephones, so that, in case of emergency, “subscribers” can get into communication with practically any place in Canada. The batteries used on the telephone service are charged from an automobile generator attached to a windmill contraption. This also provides electricity for homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio entertainment is also provided by the telephone line. A “master set” is attached to the telephone line and loud-speakers are then hooked up in the various homes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE commercial and selfish basis upon which the church organizations are built is evidenced time and again in their varied activities. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century,</span><span class="font8"> which is called “An Undenominational Journal of Religion”, writes that both Catholic and Protestant churches are falling for the so-called “Goodwin Plan”, by which the churches cooperate with an admittedly selfish and commercial organization. The object of this organization is “to make money” for itself, first of all, and, secondly, to give the various church societies a rake-off. The Goodwin corporation determines what brands of goods shall be favored by church members, the determining factor, of course, being a substantial “commission”. Each church woman who signs up as an agent of the corporation undertakes to get at least ten housewives to agree to purchase articles listed in the Goodwin catalog and to preserve the label or wrapper or other token of each purchase. This plan has possibilities. We are reminded of a Christian lady who was led to see the absurdity of spending time and effort to advance commercial schemes under the impression that she was doing “work for the Lord”. She and other members of the congregation, and as many others as could be persuaded to “work for the Lord”, took to the city dumps to collect labels and carton covers, thus increasing the commission the “church” got from the “evidences of purchase” presented to the corporation which hired them. A proper understanding of what the work of God really is brought about her deliverance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HOSE who are in the church business conceive that it is or should be the object of all mankind “to build more churches, to save more souls, to get more money, to build more churches, to save more souls, to get more money&quot;', etc., to the end of the age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It takes a lot of “saved” people to keep up a church, and to maintain in comfort a nicely dressed man who works twenty to thirty minutes twice a week, discoursing on some subject selected from the daily press. The more people that are “saved”, the more churches can be carried on the payroll. An ideal civilization, according to some of these folks, would be one in which everybody is in the church business and nobody has to do any regular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Herald</span><span class="font8"> has put out a plan for the construction of more than 200 million dollars’ worth of churches and parish houses. All that is necessary is that the people put their savings into the building of these churches. They can do this either direct or through their banks. After the churches are built it will, of course, be necessary to sustain them; so the mere building of them is only a part of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font8"> thinks that there is “plenty of money available for financing church loans on a sound basis”. Meantime it strikes us as a peculiar thing that Jesus never built a church, nor asked anybody else to do so, and He never made any money to be turned over to somebody else to do what He himself found it unnecessary or inadvisable to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">However, there is no doubt of the evangelist’s guilt, and he was positively identified by the proprietor of a store in his own county as a bandit who had robbed him twice, the last time being only nine days before the Fort Wayne affair which terminated his career. No one was allowed to see him after he was shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He was in a bad business. The work of an evangelist, as that work is conducted today, is dishonest, and it was a natural step from that to trying to get with a gun what could not be gotten without it. But it seems too bad that the man should be killed in a frame-up, or as a result of one. His nine-year-old boy is the principal sufferer.</span></p>

The stand they took during the World War should have been a sufficient eyeopener. The whole clergy-system, Catholic and Protestant, hangs and falls together. They are all tarred with the same stick. By the way, you never see anything unfavorable about Catholic priests in the paper. That is all nicely arranged. They keep their shortcomings to themselves, as well as their opinions.

Heretofore the usual course of procedure for bishops has been to encourage others to do the fighting, while the bishops stayed at home and helped the women roll bandages and knit sweaters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font8"> reports the pastor of a San Jose church as saying that scouts appeared at the doors of his church and beckoned to those inside, who crept quietly out and joined the lynching party; before the evening service was over, half the congregation had left, but the pastor did nothing to stop them. Some children, and women with babies in their arms, saw the two men kicked, beaten, stripped naked and, with blood streaming down their bodies, and screaming for mercy, strung up in St. James’ Park. The clothing and shoes of the dead men were torn in pieces and divided among the crowd as souvenirs. Governor Rolph approved the lynching and has said he would pardon any found guilty of murder in that connection. Meantime, he keeps Mooney, an innocent man, in prison. California is publicly disgraced before all the world, both in the Mooney case and now in this lynching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE so-called Christian Assembly church of Zion City, Ill., has had a marathon in which the Bible was subjected to the indignity of being read as rapidly as possible and apparently with no other object than to get the reading done. Such a course not only is useless, but is mockery in the full sense of the word: mockery of the God of the Bible, Jehovah. It is no better than the incantations of heathen and Catholic ceremonial, in which meaningless words are repeated in a monotone to no conceivable purpose.</span></p>

For the same reason many of us oppose the Child Labor Amendment.” He continues by saying that though enemies charge the Catholic church with opposing public education, it is the friend of true education. We merely observe that illiteracy is remarkably high in countries under Catholic influence, and we cannot feel that Catholic opposition to legislation for the protection of children is on the level.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font8">CCASIONALLY someone takes it hard when Judge Rutherford mentions that the clergy disbelieve the Scriptures; but the general truth of that statement cannot be questioned. The young candidates for the ministry are being taught in institutions where reverence for the Word of God is at a discount. Our attention was drawn to a column in the Sunday </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oklahoman</span><span class="font8"> where Reverend E. Nicholas Comfort, director of the School of Religion, University of Oklahoma, undertakes to answer Biblical questions. In the issue of November 12,1933, he said in so many words, “I do not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus”; and a week later, in answer to the question “Do you believe that the only remission for sin is through the shed blood of Jesus on Calvary’s cross?” he said, “I do not so believe.” We did not get to see a later issue, but presume that in that one, if somebody asked him, “Do you believe in anything except the front and back covers of the Bible?” he would have cheerfully broken the news that he “does not”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“I see a world at peace, adorned with every form of art, with music’s myriad voices thrilled, while lips are rich with words of love and truth; a world in which no exile sighs, no prisoner mourns; a world on which the gibbet’s shadow does not fall; a world where labor reaps its full reward, where work and worth go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I see a world without the beggar’s outstretched palm, the miser’s heartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the livid lips of lies, the cruel eyes of scorn.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>“Russia Makes Me Think”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font8">TNDER the title “Russia Makes Me Think” '-J Louis Golding, British author, says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am going to say this in all solemnity. If the present implications of the situation in Europe fulfil themselves, then all Europe will be Russian within a decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not mean that Soviet armies will go marching across their frontiers and incorporate ourselves, and Germany, and Italy, with their Union of Republics. I mean that the Russian idea, a far more subtle invasion, will overwhelm the European idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What do I mean when I talk of “the present implications of the situation”? I mean primarily two things. First, I mean unemployment; secondly, I mean the threat of war. Whatever your politics are, you cannot get away from the fact that unemployment is worse than it was a year ago, and much worse than it was five years ago. If the governments and the theoreticians of the Western system do not resolve this hideous puzzle of unemployment, can you imagine what the situation will be within five years from now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The history of the next few years will resolve itself, has already resolved itself, into a race between their idea and ours. If we can set our house in order again before they have set up theirs, the two ideas will live side by side. It is even possible that the restoration to perfect health of the Western idea may mean the slow extinction of the Russian idea. If we are not restored to health, and very soon, Russia will extend to Land’s End and Gibraltar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early this year I traveled through several Mediterranean countries. On my way to Russia two or three months ago, I traveled by way of the Scandinavian countries. On my way home I came by Poland and Germany and Prance. I have therefore had the opportunity to get the whole European landscape into some sort of perspective. What is more, I have spent at least half my year for a decade or so traveling from frontier to frontier. I am therefore in a position to adjudge how the present political and economic picture compares with the picture of three, five, ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I can only say that it seems to me, and to many observers, that the horizon is darker than it was five years ago. Germany and France love each other less, not more. China and Japan love each other less, not more. The hopes for disarmament are smaller, not greater, than they were a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Number Seven</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font8">VERYBODY knows there are seven notes of music, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, and seven colors, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. It is claimed that this septiformity runs through life, that insects hatch in 7 days, birds in twice 7 days, larger birds in three times 7 days, and still larger birds in four times 7 days. In man the period of gestation is forty times 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man is an infant till 7, a child till twice 7, a youth until 3 times 7, and a man at 4 times 7. At 5 times 7 he is in his prime; at 6 times 7 he begins to slip a little, at 7 times 7 he slips still more, at 8 times 7 he has to begin to slow up, at 9 times 7 he is on the home stretch, and at 10 times 7 he is all through. His body changes once in 7 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most diseases run in periods of 7 days or multiples thereof. Crises occur at 7-day intervals, and if no favorable results occur, the fifth 7-day crisis often means the end. The moon’s phases are of 7 days each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Glancing at the Scriptures everybody who has ever even superficially glanced at The Revelation has noticed the 7 churches, 7 spirits, 7 candlesticks, 7 stars, 7 angels, 7 lamps, 7 seals, 7 horns, 7 eyes, 7 trumpets, 7 thunders, 7 heads, 7 crowns, 7 plagues, 7 vials, 7 mountains, and 7 kings. In other apostolic books there are also the 7 ‘other, more wicked’ spirits, 7 loaves, 7 baskets, 7 husbands of one wife, 7 devils, 7 deacons, and 7 sons of Sceva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Hebrew Scriptures there were two 7-day intervals, at least, respecting exit from the ark, which floated off after a 7-day notice that the flood was coming. Jacob served 7 years for each of his wives. Joseph explained the dream of the 7 good and 7 bad kine and the 7 good and 7 bad ears of corn to be 7 years of plenty and 7 years of famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were 7 days of unleavened bread, 7 lamps on the candlestick, 7 days a sheep was to be with its dam, and 7 sprinklings of the blood before the Lord. Priests served for 7 consecutive days; a woman was unclean for 7 days. Lepers were shut up 7 days, and 7 days more, if necessary. When cleansed they were sprinkled 7 times, and, after living 7 days in the open, were officially pronounced clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the case of a trespass offering, some of the oil which was offered was to be sprinkled 7 times before the Lord. If leprosy broke out in a house, the house was to be closed 7 days; it was cleansed by being sprinkled 7 times with blood and water and perfumes. An unclean man was to be unclean for 7 days. The altar in the court was to be sprinkled with blood 7 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The offering by fire unto the Lord was to be made for 7 days; the pentecost followed 7 sabbaths ; the wave loaves were to be offered with 7 lambs; the feast of tabernacles was to be for 7 days; when the fruits had been gathered in there was to be a feast of 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A week of 7 days, 7-year cycles for the land, and 7 times 7 cycles for a jubilee cycle are matters familiar to all our readers, as are also the 7 symbolic “times” which ended in 1914. Miriam was ashamed 7 days and shut out of the camp 7 days. The blood of the red heifer was to be sprinkled 7 times before the tabernacle. Whoever touched a dead body was to be unclean 7 days; when a man died in his tent the tent was to be unclean 7 days; whoever touched a grave was to be unclean 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Balaam asked for 7 altars, 7 oxen and 7 rams, and this was done for him three different times. The nations that Israel dispossessed were 7; their enemies were to flee from them 7 ways. In the taking of Jericho, 7 priests with 7 trumpets compassed the city 7 days, 7 times on the 7th day. Samson’s strength was in the 7 locks of hair; he could not be restrained with 7 withs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ruth was better to Naomi than 7 sons; the temple was 7 years in building; the servant was sent 7 times to look for rain when it rained not in the days of Elijah and Ahab. When the child of the Shunammite woman awakened out of the sleep of death he sneezed 7 times; Naaman the leper was bidden to dip in Jordan 7 times. When the temple was dedicated the ceremonies took 7 days and were followed by a feast of 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Job’s comforters sat beside him 7 days and 7 nights before speaking. The words of the Lord are as silver purified 7 times. A just man falleth 7 times and riseth up again. There are 7 abominations in the heart of the hypocrite. Now 7 women take hold of the skirts of one man; the light of the sun is now as the light of 7 days. Gog’s weapons of war are to be burned for 7 years; for 7 months the bones are to be buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The furnace was heated 7 times as hot as usual for Daniel’s three friends. Upon the one stone there are to be 7 eyes. There are 7 lamps and 7 pipes to the 7 lamps. These are merely a few uses of the number 7 in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah'</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH is the King of Glory. (Psalm 24: 10) He now gives those who dwell in His sanctuary the privilege of seeing that glory. (Psalm 63:2) The purpose of revealing His royal majesty is that His people may be inspired to tell others the vision of the great King and His kingdom. It is true that no man can see Jehovah and live, yet He now reflects His majesty in the Kingdom vision so that His anointed ones may appreciate the responsibility of being His witnesses.—Exodus 33:20; Isaiah 43:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sun in its noonday brilliancy is hard to look upon, but when that light is reflected from the moon, in the nighttime, it is beautiful and pleasing to look upon. Even so today Jehovah’s royal majesty is reflected in the Kingdom vision, and this glory is appreciated by those who love Him and zealously proclaim His message. As the sun rises in the east, even so the glory of the Lord as the herald of the new day is pictured as coming from the same direction. “Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar: and I fell upon my face. And the glory of the Lord came into the house [temple], by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.”—Ezekiel 43:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is the glory of Jehovah? The glory of Jehovah is the reflection of His royal majesty. While it is true that the sovereignty of the Creator is reflected in His works, His glory is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">'s Glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">particularly displayed since the beginning of the Kingdom under Christ, in A.D. 1914. In support of this conclusion we read, in Psalm 93:1, “The Lord [Jehovah] reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself.” In Psalm 145: 5,10-13 are these words: “I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endur-eth throughout all generations.” The kingdom is glorious because it is a work of Jehovah and as such it is an expression of His majesty. Likewise the Lord’s witnesses on earth now reflect the glory of Jehovah to the degree that they speak of the great King and His kingdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>The King’s Glory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The scriptures are abundant in support of the thought that the glory of Jehovah has application particularly since the beginning of the Kingdom. Now look at Psalm 24:7-10: “Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord [Jehovah] strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.” Again, in Psalm 45:3-6, it is written of Jehovah’s anointed and installed King: “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.” All who love and serve Jehovah declare His praises, and they ever pray, “Be thou exalted, 0 God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.”—Psalm 57:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle John was one who gave all that he had to the glory of God. Because of his faithfulness in serving God he was exiled to the lonely isle of Patmos, and there he was visited by Jehovah’s officer and given a vision of the glory of the Almighty God. He was caught up in vision to “the third heaven” even as Paul, who tells how he was thus favored. Jehovah by His angel deputy, caused John to write that which he saw, for the special benefit of God’s faithful people who should be on the earth just before Armageddon begins. Now, and especially since 1922, God’s remnant on earth have begun to see the fulfilment of John’s vision, and those still alive on the earth at Armageddon will discern, it more clearly. What is now discerned thrills the heart of the child of God, and he says: “0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.”—Psalm 8:1, 2.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Vision of Glory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">John had a vision of the glory of Jehovah as revealed in the new kingdom, and as the remnant see and appreciate this vision fulfilled the glory of Jehovah rises upon them. It is manifestly the wrong thought that all the glory for the members of the remnant will be experienced after their resurrection change. While it is true that there will be glory indeed experienced by those who will have the privilege of sharing in the first resurrection and obtain the immortal life, yet Jehovah wishes them to realize a glory now while they are on earth for a definite purpose. The purpose of their realizing the vision of Jehovah’s organization, and as a result coming under the glory of Jehovah’s majesty now, is to quicken them for a witness work to be accomplished. As the remnant are faithful in making proclamation of the Kingdom message the Gentiles will recognize and be drawn to the light of truth and the kings of earth must take a definite stand. Jehovah commands His people: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”— Isaiah 60:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the thought in mind that Jehovah reveals this vision and causes His glory to arise upon His people to quicken them to action, let us examine the picture presented in Revelation 21:1: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.” The term “heaven” here used means “the kingdom of heaven”. It is new in this, that it is the new government and displaces the old. “New earth” means the peoples of earth organized in righteousness. “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13) This is in harmony with God’s promise to make a new heaven and a new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 'Leaven” is the invisible ruling power; the “earth”, the visible part of the organization which the Kingdom rules. “For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” (Isaiah 65:17) ‘The first heaven and earth that were passed away’ means the organization of mankind under the invisible rulership of Satan that existed from the Flood until now. The text says: “And there was no more sea,” meaning that ungodly human creatures from which Satan developed his “beast” (visible earthly organization) would no longer exist. (Revelation 13:1, 2) God will reconcile the people to himself. Those who refuse to be reconciled shall be destroyed, and there will be a clean heaven and earth, making a new<sup>7</sup> heaven and a new earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Witnesses See Glory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">In this picture John represents Jehovah’s faithful witnesses now upon the earth who have the privilege of seeing the glorious vision and then telling it to others. “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her bushand.” (Revelation 21:2) “The holy city” is the heavenly organization completely separated from the wicked one and his organization, and every whit thereof dedicated to the Holy One, Jehovah; and therefore it is holy. In ancient times out of all the cities in the earth only one city was designated by Jehovah as “the holy city”, and that was Jerusalem. It was typical. And so in the antitype there is but one “city” or organization which forms a part (the capital part) of Jehovah’s greater organization and is the “holy city”.—Nehemiah 11:1,18; Isaiah 52:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The name “new Jerusalem” means “the possession [foundation] of peace, the secure habitation”. It has no reference to the earthly city of Jerusalem, either ancient or modern. It is the new organization composed of new creatures in Christ and called the “new creation” of God. It does not include the “great multitude” or ‘tribulation class’ (Revelation 7: 9-14); and this is indicated by the text. Only the overcomers have its name written on them.—Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This new Jerusalem is the workmanship of Jehovah, and, being the chief part of the Kingdom, it reflects the royal majesty of the Creator. This new city is resplendent with the glory of God. It has twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, which fact excludes all who are not members of the body of Christ. It has twelve gates bearing the names of the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel, showing that only “the servant of God” is admitted to its membership. It is organized in heaven, the abode of Jehovah, and it is therefore the holy “city” or organization ‘which hath foundations, whose builder is God’. (Hebrews 11:10,16) It is “cut out of [his] mountain [meaning God’s universal organization] without hands [of men]”, and it comes down from heaven and rules the earth.—Daniel 2:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning those who represent that “city” it is said: “They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” (Psalm 145: 11,12) “0 give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.” (Psalm 105:1-3) Thus the burden of the message which the remnant now bear to the people magnifies the name and the kingdom of Jehovah. This message is not their own: they speak the good news of the Lord, and thus reveal His glory to the people. Those of this “city” do not claim any share in the manmade governments of the Devil’s organization, but rather look to the new nation of heavenly origin. “For our conversation [citizenship, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham}</span><span class="font8"> is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Philippians 3:20) This is further proof that none will be of that holy city as citizens or parts thereof except those who are the members of the body of Christ. It is a beautiful “city” and is adorned for her glorious husband Christ, the Head of that “city”. (Isaiah 61:10) “As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.” (Isaiah 62:5) “So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.” (Psalm 45:11) In it is “the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness; . . . the voice of the bride; the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy en-dureth for ever”.—Jeremiah 33:11.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Tabernacle with Men</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">In Revelation 21:3 we read, “And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” This verse applies specifically to God’s people now on the earth. John heard the voice; which denotes that the remnant first hears this message from the throne and then transmits it to the people. “And the remnant of Jacob [spiritual Israel] shall be in the midst of many people, as dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.”—Micah 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is strong evidence that some of the remnant will be on the earth after Armageddon and will be the ones used by the Lord to first inform the people who have survived the time of trouble. The message from the throne is, “The tabernacle of God is with men,” and suggests that the remnant of God, the sanctuary class at that time, is still on the earth in a lowly, transient condition, like that of a tent or tabernacle. This reference is to the “true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man”, and which is not one built by human hands. (Hebrews 8: 2; 9:11) In this tabernacle the song goes up: “The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens. Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Give unto the Lord, 0 ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.”—Psalm 96: 4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the Kingdom has begun, surely the Lord will have on earth some representative henceforth and forever. If so, then the faithful prophets and servants of God before Christ, who as princes shall represent the Lord on earth, must return before all the remnant class has passed from the earth. (Psalm 45:16) The earth must be a &quot;holy place” from the time God’s representatives take possession, even though the enemy continues to defile it up until he and his organization are destroyed. Then, as shown to the apostle John, God, ruling through His representatives, shall bring blessings to mankind and He will be the God of all who obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is wonderful how Jehovah has manifested His glory in the vision of His kingdom and hope for the recovery of the obedient of the human family. It is in this, too, that the great King reflects His royal sovereignty; because the Kingdom is the only hope for suffering mankind. In Revelation 21:4 we read, “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow’, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed aw<sup>T</sup>ay.” Christ will be the hand that God will use to wipe away all tears. (1 Corinthians 15:25,26; Hosea 13:14) For many centuries the people have suffered oppression, pain, injury, sickness, loss of health and of life. Gradually these things shall be made to pass away and there will be no more slavery, drudgery, or cruel oppression, and at length there will be no sickness and no death. The final result of the reign of Christ will be the destruction of every enemy of man, including death. All this shall be to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>All Things New</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Continuing this vision of Jehovah’s glory the fifth verse of the same chapter states, “And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write; for these words are true and faithful.” Manifestly this represents Jehovah speaking to John then and to the John class now. (Revelation 4: 2; 5:1) It is God who will reconcile the people to himself; and “all things are of God” and by Christ, His “right hand”. (2 Corinthians 5:17,18; Ephesians 4:2-6) There shall be an entirely new world. “For behold, I [Jehovah] create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.”— Isaiah 65:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the remnant Jehovah gives the “new wine” of good cheer and joy. (Matthew 26:29) He establishes the new Jerusalem. (Revelation 3:12) He inaugurates the new covenant with the true spiritual Israelites. (Hebrews 8:8-13) Then He gives a new heart to the people who love and obey Him, and everything is made to the good of creation and to the glory of God. (Ezekiel 36:26; 11:19) This is what John heard and what the remnant now discern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John not only had this glorious vision of things that must shortly come to pass, but was commanded to write them. Now the remnant, whom John represented, seeing these things coming to pass, to them Jehovah now says: “New things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.” (Isaiah 42: 9) It follows, therefore, that the remnant is not shown these things of Jehovah’s glory merely for the pleasure of the remnant, but that as witnesses for Jehovah they might tell them out to others. That witness to the name of Jehovah must continue until the 'princes of the earth’ return. The testimony or word of God is “true and faithful”, is reliable and trustworthy and sure of accomplishment. Blessed is the class now having a part in telling that message of truth to the people and to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again the voice of Jehovah is heard by John from the throne of heaven. The remnant discern that voice of Jehovah through His Word, and see the fulfilment thereof in these last days. That voice says: “And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.” (Revelation 21:6) This scripture has no reference to the people during the millennial reign of Christ. It is addressed specifically to John and to the class whom John represented. When the seventh angel (Revelation 16:17) poured out his bowl of wrath the same expression is used, “It is done”; meaning there that now the issue is completely joined and you have been informed of God’s purposes against Satan’s organization and you are privileged to have a part therein. What could be the meaning of a like expression in the text, verse six, here under consideration ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Revelation from Jehovah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The Revelation is from Jehovah God to Christ Jesus, which He now shows His servant class. It is Jehovah that now says to the servant class on earth: T am the A and the Z </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[Rotherham</span><span class="font8"> translation], the Beginning and the End, the Author and the Finisher; I have given you this message; it is done; now you go forth and bear testimony thereof as my witnesses.’ It is Jehovah who inspired His Word from the beginning, and now He brings it to a close. He discloses His purposes. Let it be understood, again, for emphasis, that the vision of Jehovah’s new organization reflects the glory of Jehovah. The remnant see this and appreciate it, and thus Jehovah’s glory rests upon them. They in turn reflect the glory of Jehovah as they tell the vision to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is beyond the Millennium need not be revealed in the Holy Scriptures. God has expressed His purpose in His Word and told it to the servant class and “thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it”. (Deuteronomy 12:32) It is His spirit-begotten ones that thirst for the water or truth of life and are always eager to have more. Jehovah says to such: “I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.” It therefore becomes the privilege and the duty of God’s witnesses on earth who are in the everlasting covenant according to the sure mercies of David to cry out to their brethren concerning the great truths of God’s expressed purposes. They are commanded to say: ‘Ho, every one that thirst-eth, come ye to the waters; come and buy without money and without price.’ (Isaiah 55:1) “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” —Matthew 5: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who thus hunger and thirst for the truth have been given a blessed privilege since the Lord came to His temple. If they have seen and appreciated the glory of Jehovah as manifested in His kingdom organization they have been proclaiming the good news to the people. These with joy receive the truth out of the wells of salvation and they are filled with praise: “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.”—Isaiah 12: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the remnant receive these blessed truths, each one thereof must cry out to others to come and take their stand on the side of Jehovah, become His witnesses, accept the leadership of Christ Jesus and go forward in His organization. This is the reason why brethren beseech one another to present themselves daily and actively in the Lord’s service. It is the spirit-begotten ones to whom the question is now addressed : “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?” The Lord causes His prophet to write the answer: “He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, 0 Jacob.”—Psalm 24:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus it is seen that Jehovah’s glory is closely associated with the revelation of His royal majesty, and that particularly since the Kingdom has begun. As the sincere members of the remnant see and appreciate the glory from the Kingdom vision, they are thrilled with wonder. They have a zeal peculiar only to those now dwelling in the temple of Jehovah. They must tell the message concerning the great name and kingdom of their God; and the people of good will to whom the message is told likewise have the privilege of telling it out to their fellow men. “Let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”—Revelation 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soon Jehovah’s highest glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall be known in all the earth, As His King and Vindicator</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall reveal its matchless worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every tongue His name confessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then shall bring Him willing praise;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every knee before Him bowing, Eager feet shall tread His ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the proud and rude oppressor</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall be humbled in the dust</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nations in His name confiding</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In His Son shall put their trust.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Pioneers in North Carolina</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“fAUITE a little excitement in Kinston, while the friends were there. Six of the friends were arrested and put in jail Sunday morning, two sisters and four brothers, all pioneers. The rest of the workers were in another section and not bothered at all. They had a trial Monday morning, and were dismissed without much trouble. It happened that the judge was very favorable to the truth, and had been hearing the radio lectures, so gave them a square deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Catholic priest called the police, and had several of his friends to make complaints. The trial was too funny to describe. The priest was the first witness called, and he just made a laughingstock of himself. He said that a sister had ridiculed his priestly robes, by calling to another sister on the other side of the street, saying: ‘Come over here and see this man wearing women’s skirts.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Well, the whole courtroom just roared. They had five witnesses, and we had none. When they had given in all their evidence against us, the judge told them that they had no case at all. They claimed we were peddling without a license, but we claimed to be preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The judge told them that the constitution and state laws granted us the privilege of preaching in whatever manner we liked, and whether or not we were doing it in the right way, he would leave with the higher judge to decide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Concentration of Wealth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By V. S. Senator Huey P. Long</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">B</span><span class="font8">ACK in 1916 everybody, even including the capitalistic newspapers and magazines, said that an intolerable condition, bordering on calamity, existed because the “poor” class, 65 percent of the people, owned only 5 percent of the wealth; and the “middle” class, 33 percent of the people, owned only 35 percent of our wealth; thus leaving the “rich”, 2 percent of the people, owning all the other 60 percent of our national wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But today the whole 95 percent of our people own less than 15 percent of our wealth, which is less than half the middle class, alone, owned in 1916.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even the rich class has shown greater concentration in its own ranks. Like cannibals, they are eating one another, and here and there a rich man falls a victim, while another becomes richer, not only out of the blood of the poor, </span><span class="font9">but </span><span class="font8">even from the fall of another rich one. In 1916 the rich class, 2 percent, owned 60 percent of our wealth; in 1930 the rich class had dropped to 1 percent, but still owned 60 percent of our wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, if back in 1916 (when our wealth was not half so badly concentrated in the hands of the few as it now is), these rich men’s newspapers and magazines said that the conditions of 1916 would wreck the country, unless corrected, how can they doubt what has wrecked us now and is going to wreck us worse, when the rich of 1930 have become twice as rich as they were in 1916, and the poor of 1916 have become five times as poor in 1933, with the people of the middle class of 1916 falling into the poor class of 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How, I say, can these same people who wailed about what existed in 1916 fail to see what worse conditions of concentrated wealth exist today ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I propose that every man who owns a million dollars of property should contribute 1 percent to the government. I propose that if a man owns $2,000,000 he contribute 2 percent to the government. That would mean only ten thousand dollars for the man who owns a million dollars, and that would leave him $990,000. If he has $2,000,000,1 would take $40,000, and that would leave him $1,960,000. I propose that if a man has $6,000,000, the government should take 6 percent. I propose to take 1 percent from a man owning a million, and gradually go up until I would impose a capital-levy tax stopping fortunes at $100,000,000.</span></p>

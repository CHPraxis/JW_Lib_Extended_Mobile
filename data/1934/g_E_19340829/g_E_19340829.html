<p><span class="font14">Praying for Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Broadcast by Judge Rutherford, Sunday, August 12, 1934, over chain from WBBR</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font9">EPRESSION has been upon the world for live years, and now millions are confronted with starvation. In this time of dire extremity religious organizations, led by the Catholic St. Joseph’s Guild of New Jersey, have issued an appeal to all denominations, Jews and Gentiles, to join in prayer on certain days in September next that “this nation may be restored again to a condition of prosperity, peace and happiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If it is the will of Almighty God that the people should offer such prayer, then all should do so. If this “Prayer Movement” is a fraudulent scheme to further deceive and entrap the people, and to bring them into greater difficulties, then all should know the truth concerning the same and deport themselves accordingly. The only certain way for men to ascertain the will of Almighty God is to go to His Word, the Bible, and there learn what is His expressed will. I appeal to the people to now calmly consider the facts and the Scriptures and then determine what course you will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At all times we must have in mind these indisputable truths, to wit: That there is but one Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” and in whose hand rests the destiny of all nations; that He has one great Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, who is also the Savior of humankind, and in. His name prayers must be made; that there is one arch adversary of Jehovah God, and man’s worst enemy, whose name is Satan, the Devil, and wdiose purpose is to turn all men array from God and lead them into destruction. Fraud and deception are Satan’s chief means of accomplishing his wicked purpose. Often he induces men to put forward a scheme which on the face of it appears to be right but which in fact is a subtle snare in which to entrap the unsuspecting ones. All of Satan’s representatives on earth, both the willing and the unwilling, are unrighteous, and God will not hear and answer the prayers of the unrighteous. (1 Peter 3:12) The prayers of such are not heeded by Jehovah, for the reason that the petitioners are evil; and for anyone to join with such in prayer would be worse than useless, because the same is an abomination in the sight of God. It is of vital importance to all of us just now to view this matter without passion or prejudice and to ascertain and follow the truth. In order to do this it is important to consider some historical facts, because what has resulted in the past furnishes us a guide to determine what will be the result under similar conditions in the future.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The effect of this address upon the hearers was electrifying. Nobody is taunted, but nobody is warned; the time for that is past. This address is telling everybody who will listen that it Is impossible to ignore and dishonor Jehovah God and Christ Jesus at one time and then expect at another time to receive His favor merely because it is desired, and because there are even “distinguished&quot; ones who desire it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It would seem that nobody can read this address without a higher appreciation than ever of the value of the wisdom that is from above. This priceless wisdom finds expression in the divine message addressed to the hypocritical mockers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of [JEHOVAH].&quot;—Proverbs 1:24-29.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Last Year’s Unanswered Prayers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">In March, 1933, St. Joseph’s Guild was launched, and now leads in the aforementioned “Prayer Movement”. Thereafter, on the 2d of April, 1933, the pope’s “Holy Year” began with</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the announcement that prayers would be made to the end &quot;that a tide of religion would sweep the nations into peace and prosperity’. The “Holy Year” and its prayers have utterly failed, and depression and suffering continue upon the people. From Press dispatches appearing in Catholic newspapers from Rome, England and America I quote: “The extraordinary year [the ‘Holy Year’] closes with a silence of the pope. . . . A silence which the father told his sons that he knew of nothing he could say to them.” Why? “Holy Year” has been a dismal failure, and that fact all must concede. The pope admits that “Holy Year” prayers God has not heard or answered. The conditions are worse today than they were a year ago. There is no prosperity, and peace has not come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Admitting the failure of the Catholic “Holy Year” and its prayers, now the St. Joseph Guild by “Resolution” calls upon “all who have confidence in God, the Almighty Father of all mankind, regardless of race, color or creed”, to join in prayer for the return of prosperity. Seeing that the prayers of the united </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font9"> organizations who profess to believe on Christ have failed, then why now ask non-Catholics and non-Christians, and Jews, and those other organizations that deny Christ Jesus, to join in the “Prayer Movement”? Will the prayers of such add compelling force to wring from God’s hand the desired selfish prosperity ? The failure of the “Holy Year” prayers ought to fully convince the people that there is something wrong about these movements that attempt to bring prosperity, and this should cause the people to examine God’s Word and ascertain therefrom what is wrong.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>New Prayers Improper and Futile</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The aforementioned Resolution calls for certain days of prayer to be had next September, but the Resolution does not mention Jehovah’s name, nor the name of Jesus Christ. Evidently this is because the appeal is addressed to antiChristians, both Jews and higher-critic Protestant clergy, otherwise called “modernists”, and to others who deny Christ as the Redeemer. The language of the Resolution is: ‘To beseech our common Father in heaven,’ which language could not apply to the Almighty God, because He is not the common Father of all. Since the days of Adam’s sin in Eden Jehovah God is not the “Father of all men”..In His day Jesus said to the clergy of Israel: “Ye are of your father the devil” (John 8: 44), and today Jewish rabbis and modernists, and Protestant clergy, reject Jesus Christ and His kingdom, and hence they could not be sons of God. The Scriptures of God’s Word declare that Jehovah, the Almighty God, is the Father only of those who believe on and honor Jesus Christ even as they honor God. (John 5: 23) All men are born sinners. (Romans 5:12) The only way a man can be cleansed from sin and become the son of God is by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, a full devotion to Him, and the acceptance and begetting of that man by Jehovah God. (Acts 4:12; 1 Peter 1:3,4; James 1:18) From the Bible I quote these words: “The blood of Jesus Christ, [God’s] Son, cleanseth us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7) In John 9: 31 it is written: “Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.” Only those who have been cleansed by full faith in the blood of Christ Jesus does God count as righteous and acknowledge as His sons, and it is only these whose prayers are heard and answered; as it is written (1 Peter 3:12): “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” (Acts 10:1-4) He who dishonors the Lord Jesus Christ dishonors Jehovah God, and God will not receive him or his prayers.—John 5:23.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>God No Respecter of Persons</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">From the “Prayer Movement” news release I quote these words: “The prayer movement has the endorsement of postmaster general . . . United States senators . . . congressmen . . . governors . . . and other distinguished men from many parts of the United States.” What do these endorsements add, since the men mentioned do not worship Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as man’s Redeemer and the world’s rightful Ruler? The only prosperity the endorsement of such “distinguished men” will bring will be to those who receive the church basket collections. The endorsement of distinguished politicians and financiers of Satan’s organization will tend to swing into line for the “Prayer Movement” the overawed and unsuspecting people, because those “distinguished men” are highly esteemed among them; but in God’s sight such approval and endorsement is an abomination, as it is written (Luke 16:15): ‘That which is highly esteemed by men is an abomination in the sight of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “Prayer Resolution’’ says: ‘Unite in prayer, to beseech our common Father to inspire our leaders so that this nation may be restored again to prosperity? That language is a recognition of the politicians, financiers and clergy as the leaders of this world, and as “the higher powers”, and hence the claim that such men are God’s instruments to lead the people, and which claim is contrary to the Scriptures. Jehovah says concerning Jesus Christ (Isaiah 55: 4): “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” Prayer for the inspiration of worldly leaders is wholly in vain. God answers the prayers of those only who are guided by His Word and who recognize Jehovah and Christ Jesus as the “higher powers”.—Romans 13:1.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>“Ke </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ask and Receive Not”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Are not these “distinguished men”, who are designated by the Resolution as “leaders”, a part of this world ? and are not the clergy who have launched the “Prayer Movement” also a part of the world and friends of the world? You will all answer, Yes, of course. Will God hear their prayers for personal and material prosperity? The answer is found in James 4:3,4, the authoritative Word of God, to wit: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” Jehovah God will not answer the prayers of His enemies, and this is conclusive proof that the “Prayer Movement” fathered by St. Joseph's Guild will fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to a poll of the clergy of the United States published by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary Digest</span><span class="font9"> the majority of the clergymen repudiate Christ Jesus and His blood as the means of saving mankind, and deny that Jesus is God’s anointed King to rule and bless mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Concerning Jesus Christ Jehovah says (Matthew 12:18,21, A.R.F., margin): &quot;Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall [shew] judgment to the nations. . . . And in his name shall the nations hope.” Could it be expected that Jehovah God would hear and answer the prayers of men who repudiate His Word and who deny His anointed King, the Redeemer of mankind? Do the people now wish to be guided by selfish and imperfect men or do they want to trust in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus? By your course of action concerning the “Prayer Movement” you will answer that question. I insist that what I say is not an attack upon men, but I am merely laying the facts plainly before the people that they may receive the truth and then assume the responsibility of whatsoever course they take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptures clearly show that with the beginning of the great World War in 1914 Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world ended and that there Christ Jesus was enthroned by Jehovah as the world’s rightful ruler. (Matthew 24: 3-8; Psalm 2:6) The Scriptures clearly point out exactly what would follow that date marking the end of the world, and concerning this it is written: “There shall be . . . upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea [the people] and the waves [commercial organizations] roaring [because of the depression or hard times] ; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after* those things which are coming on the earth </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[R.V.,</span><span class="font9"> world].” (Luke 21: 25, 26) The “Prayer Resolution” completely ignores these scriptures concerning the end of Satan's world and the woes and troubles upon the people that would immediately follow. Who is the one that brings these woes upon the world? The “Prayer Resolution” ignores this point, but many of the clergy say that God has brought the woes upon the people; whereas the Scriptures definitely state that Satan the Devil is the one who brings these woes now upon humankind because he knows that it is only a short time until the final battle in which his organization will be destroyed.—Revelation 12:12.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>God Not Responsible for Inflation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God is in no wise responsible for the unhealthy so-called “prosperity” that immediately followed the World War, and during which many men grew rich, arrogant and oppressive. Jehovah is in no wise responsible for the hard times or depression now on the world, nor will He hear the prayers of those who ask such former prosperity to be restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A safe guide is to follow the course of faithful Christians, the apostles of Jesus’ day. It was about the year A.D. 44 that the absence of rain brought a great famine upon the people of Palestine. The apostle Paul and other faithful Christians did not ask all creeds and denominations to unite in prayei' for the restoration of prosperity; but, as the Scriptures state, those faithful Christians gathered food and distributed it amongst the poor, and did not try to increase the prosperity of the rich. (Acts 11: 2630; Romans 15:25,26; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3) Mark the great contrast in the course of professed ‘'Christians” of this day. The greater portion of the grain-producing area of the country is burned up, and the public press announces that because of the scarcity of wheat the money value of the wheat crop will be the greatest in many years. More than ten million people are facing starvation; and at the same time the “distinguished men” who rule the nation, and who endorse the “Prayer Movement”, cause the price of bread to be raised and thus increase the burden of the poor. At the same time these “distinguished men” and clergymen ask the people to pray that prosperity may return, which prosperity only the rich enjoyed prior to 1929. Do you believe that the God of mercy and comfort will hear such selfish prayers and bring prosperity to those who have lived wantonly and ruled in arrogance while the poor have starved and their burdens have continued to increase? Those are the men who speak scornfully of the name of the Most High, and concerning them it is written, in Proverbs 1: 32, 33: &quot;For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.” Thoughtful people know that the so-called “Prayer Movement” is a mockery of God and a snare of the enemy to entrap those who follow blind leaders.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The U. S. a Pari of “Christendom'’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The United States is a part of “Christendom” and claims to be a Christian nation, and is therefore duty-bound to obey and to follow the laws of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The United States, with all other nations of “Christendom”, has violated God's everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life by the unnecessary and wanton shedding of blood (Genesis 9:1-9); and God will not hear the prayers of such covenant-breakers, but, on the contrary, their fate is plainly stated, in Isaiah 24:3-5: “The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourneth, and fadeth away; the world languisheth, and fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.&quot; This punishment here described God will inflict on the world at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Furthermore, the Resolution calling for united prayer of all creeds, and which has the endorsement of “distinguished men”, had its origin with the clergymen in New Jersey, where the name of Jehovah God has been grossly reproached by clergy and officials, and where officials of that state have brazenly said: “Who is Jehovah </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">T’</span><span class="font9"> “Jehovah may run heaven, but we are running New Jersey.” In that state recently hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested, imprisoned, and woefully illtreated, merely because they were preaching the gospel of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as commanded by the Lord. There Jehovah’s witnesses have been diligently trying to inform the people of the end of Satan’s reign, of the famine and pestilence and trouble that are coming upon the earth, and of God's kingdom of righteousness under Christ, which is the only hope of mankind. Like the Jewish clergy in the days of Jeremiah, even so the Catholic hierarchy of New Jersey and their allies there have said and now say to the people: Give no heed to these Jehovah witnesses; there will be no great trouble, you will not see famine, but you shall have peace and prosperity.’ Now in these days of distress, woe and perplexity these same clergymen ask all the people to join with them and the “distinguished men” of the nation in prayer for material prosperity; but their prayers are certain to go unanswered, for the reason, as stated by Jehovah through His prophet in these words (Jeremiah 11:14): “Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Satan’s Trap</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">I do not say that St. Joseph’s Guild has knowledge that its Resolution is Satan’s scheme, but I do most emphatically charge that Satan is the father of the scheme and Satan has thus set a trap to ensnare the people and to turn them away from God; and the reason I so state is this: A part of the great question for determination now is, Can Satan cause all men to curse God and turn away from Him? Satan has challenged God to put men on earth who would maintain their integrity toward Him, and now Satan would prefer to see all men destroyed rather than to see one serve Jehovah. Satan has induced his earthly agents to believe and teach the people that God is responsible for the woes and sufferings that have come upon them. Now he would induce the people, together with the clergy and other “distinguished men” of the nation, to pray to God to relieve them from their sufferings and bring them prosperity, and, further, to pray that their earthly ‘leaders may be inspired to lead the people into prosperity’. Satan well knows that these prayers God will not hear or answer and that when people see that this so-called “Prayer Movement” is a complete failure, and that their prayers are not answered, and that their suffering increases, then the people will be greatly chagrined and disappointed. What, then, will be the tendency of those who have thus prayed and are disappointed? Satan expects them to say: “If God cannot help us, and will not do so, then we will have nothing to do with God,” and that then they will turn away from Him and curse God. Thus the Devil will bring the people into his snare. Be it known unto you now that every one who follows this “Prayer Movement” scheme will be led into and ensnared by Satan's trap.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Proper Course</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, shall the people do? Quit following the instructions given them by selfish men, who make themselves the leaders of the people, and turn entirely to Jehovah God and to Christ Jesus, whom God has made Ruler and Leader of those who will receive His blessings. The Bible contains the full and complete information; and with the helps which the Lord has provided you can get this full and complete information for your guide.* Know this, that Satan’s world has ended and is rapidly going to pieces and at Armageddon, which is near, Satan’s world will be completely destroyed. The hope of the peoples of the world is Christ Jesus’ kingdom, and there is no other hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Long ago Jehovah by His prophets said (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 9:6,7): “Behold, the days come . . . that I will raise ... a righteous Branch, and a King [Christ Jesus] shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.” “And the government shall be upon his shoulder; and ... of his government and peace there shall be no end.” Peace </span><span class="font7">* See advertisement on back page. </span><span class="font9">and prosperity can come to the peoples of the earth only by and through God's kingdom under Christ, and this will not come by the efforts of clergymen and politicians or other “distinguished men” of the world. Such men will have nothing whatsoever to do with the Kingdom nor with the blessings it shall bring humankind.— Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Proper Prayers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">It is written in the Scriptures that Jehovah God hears the prayers of those that call upon Him in spirit and in truth. (Psalm 145:18; John 4:23) The political rulers and other “distinguished men” do not call upon the Lord in spirit and according to His Word of truth. His Word, the Bible, is the truth and the only proper guide for man, and Christ Jesus is the great exponent of the truth. (Psalm 119:105; John 17:17; 18: 37; 14:6) Jehovah will not hear the prayers of those who reject His Word and His Son, Christ Jesus. Because the blessings of peace and prosperity and happiness can and will come only by and through God's kingdom under Christ, Jesus instructed men how to pray. To them He said, at Matthew 6: 9,10: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Is the call for “nation-wide prayer for prosperity” in line with these words of Christ Jesus? Most assuredly not. That Resolution not only is selfish and asks for the return of the things that were once enjoyed by the rich, who have long oppressed the poor, but completely ignores God’s honor and His name, and the name and honor of Christ Jesus, does not ask that the will of God be done, completely repudiates the kingdom of God, and asks that the will of selfish men be done. There is a complete absence of any suggestion that the people should pray that the will of God be done on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Faithful and True Witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">For more than twenty years the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in this land have told the people that God’s kingdom is near and that it is the hope of the world. They have been going about the land from house to house unselfishly and diligently trying to teach the people of and concerning God and His kingdom, and for doing this they have been hated and persecuted. Jesus said that this would be done to His faithful followers because they honor His name. (John 15:18-23) The clergy and their political allies, instead of hailing the kingdom of Christ with gladness, and urging the people to look to that kingdom for their relief and blessings have conspired together to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and to keep the people in ignorance of the truth concerning the Kingdom. Exactly as Jehovah’s prophet says in the 83d Psalm: ‘The clergy and their allies have consulted together with one consent against the faithful followers of Christ Jesus.’ This they have done in these “last days”. ‘They have taken counsel against God’s people and consulted against His hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation.’ In the execution of this cruel conspiracy against God and His kingdom under Christ the clergy and their allies, who now endorse the present-day'“prayer movements”, have committed many overt acts against the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. At much effort Jehovah’s witnesses have printed the message of God’s kingdom and have carried it to the people in book form. The clergy not only have opposed this message of God’s kingdom, but have caused the people to gather together the books containing the Kingdom message and to burn them, and now these same men ask the people to join with them in prayer for their own selfish prosperity. Furthermore, they try to impress the people with the weight and importance of their “Prayer Movement” by telling them that many “distinguished” politicians endorse the movement. They are not deceiving God, and let no one who really loves God now be deceived. To aid you in avoiding such deception this speech is now made.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Armageddon Sure to Come</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God has put His stamp of disapproval upon the “Holy Year” and its prayers; and that is admitted. Next, the pontiff at Rome, according to a dispatch published in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span><span class="font9"> of February 2, 1934, asked the people to pray that Armageddon may be averted. That appeal of the pontiff is also certain to fail. Jehovah God has entered judgment against the world and its god, Satan. That judgment written is that Christ Jesus at Armageddon shall completely wreck and destroy the wicked and oppressive rule of this world. Concerning Armageddon Jesus says: ‘It will be the greatest tribulation the world has ever known, and there will never be another,’ because that will mark the end of wickedness and the destruction of the wicked.—Matthew 24: 21, 22; Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God has decreed that Armageddon shall come, which conflict He designates as “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), and the combined prayers of creeds and organizations will not stop it. Jehovah says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) The NR A and all like recovery schemes will certainly fail, and the prayers of the combined clergy in support of that and all other like schemes for prosperity will also fail. Such prayers will not be heard and answered by Almighty God, because He so states. Prayer uttered in accord with the St. Joseph’s Guild appeal will completely fail to bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the people. The people of good will who desire righteousness will no longer permit themselves to be deceived by such abortive schemes. Those who love God will pray not only during three days in September, but they will be praying constantly every day to Jehovah, in the name of Christ Jesus, in this manner: ‘Hallowed and vindicated be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, and Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’ God knows of the things we have need of, and hence it is unnecessary and improper to ask for more than our daily bread, even as Jesus taught us to pray; and when the will of God is done on earth all oppression and depression will cease and there will then come to stay peace, prosperity and happiness, and these blessings will come only by and through the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Take Your Stand Now</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">If you would have your prayers answered, take your stand wholly on the side of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, His King, and then be guided by the Word which the Lord has spoken. To such, and to such only, Jesus says (John 15:7): “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” The selfish ones of this world who ask for material prosperity and pursue a course contrary to God and His kingdom are not in Christ, nor does the Word of the Lord dwell in them; hence their prayers will not be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The world’s darkest hour is just ahead. Satan will continue to bring upon the people one woe after another until God hears the cries of the poor. These cries will not be for prosperity, but that God will relieve them from oppressors. It is the rulers and “distinguished men” that have lived in ease, while those who produce the bread have gone hungry. Instead of the prayers of such wanton and selfish men being heard by Jehovah, He says to them (James 5:4): “Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of [battle].” The God of battle will destroy such at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you would find refuge in that time of great tribulation take your stand on the side of His kingdom, be taught by His Word of truth, and follow His way of righteousness, and ere long you are certain to emerge into the brilliant light of endless prosperity, peace and everlasting life, which you will receive at the gracious hand of Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus. —Romans 6: 23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font9">T. JOSEPH’S GUILD, a branch of the Catholic hierarchy, on Sunday, July 1, 1934, issued an appeal to the “distinguished” people to bring prosperity, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Resolved, that Saint Joseph’s Guild shall make every effort to induce the men and women of the United States, individually and in groups or organizations of whatever denomination, to unite in humble prayer, beseeching our common Father in Heaven to guide our hearts and minds and to inspire our leaders, so that this nation may be restored again to a condition of prosperity, peace and happiness; and it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Further Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States, to the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, to the Governors and Legislatures of our States, and that it be disseminated through pulpit and press and every other available means of communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The prayer movement has the endorsement of Postmaster General Farley; the late Secretary of the Treasury Woodin; U. S. Senators Kean and Barbour of New Jersey, and U. S. Senator Copeland of New York; Congressmen Eaton, Sutphin, Powers and Hartley of New Jersey; the late Governor Rolph of California; Governors Moore of New Jersey, Ross of Idaho, Herring of Iowa, and other distinguished men from many parts of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this issue Judge Rutherford shows how utterly vain is the attempt to secure prosperity by the use of the names of influential and prosperous men. Actually the Roman hierarchy brings the names of “distinguished” persons into this appeal in the hope that, for yet a little while longer, it will aid them in their efforts to keep the people bamboozled, and the flow of their shekels into the collection boxes unimpeded.</span></p>

Because of this situation the nonCatholic teachers are often so harassed by Roman Catholic principals and teachers that they become disheartened and resign. The “pope” claims the absolute right to conduct all educational activities in the United States and declares that state control of education is a great evil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">T STIRLING, New Jersey, a nation-wide movement has been started by St. Joseph's Guild to set aside a day in September to pray for prosperity. The Jews are to pray on the day originally set aside for them by Jehovah God; others are to pray on sabbaths of their own making; but all will pray in vain, for God will not hear their prayer. It all reminds one of the account in 1 Kings 18: 26-29: “And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, 0 Baa], hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped [up and down at] the altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves, after their manner, with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.” All the beads and images and holy water in creation will never bring an answer. “Christendom” is doomed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Virgin Mary Created Before Eve (!)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font9">HE following is a translation of an item in a publication put out by the Franciscan order, circulated in Poland to the extent of half a million copies. It speaks for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“God breathed upon the flowers of the Garden of Eden, and pure white, beautiful as light and fragrant as the lily, stood the first woman, created from the most beautiful things of beauty and brightness that the Garden possessed. . . . But Adam stood wholly indifferent and insensible, because she was too fluttery, nebulous and cloudy and he would not know what to do with such a mate, therefore could not line up with her. God knew at once that to such a rough nature as Adam’s the beautiful woman would be too fancy, and that, at the least, Adam was not worthy of her. So God took the virgin flower for himself and for Adam he created another woman, a more suitable mate, that looked much like Adam himself. From his bone, from his rib was Eve made. The virgin flower God preserved in the immaculate state and purity of her color </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">another purpose; then, later, he made her the mother of his son. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And, mind you, these are the people that are trying to crowd a person like Judge Rutherford off the air. There is not a syllable of truth in any of their statements, nothing of the Bible, nothing of common sense. Mary was a virgin, like other respectable young women, but she was the child of Eli and his wife, both sinners (Luke 3:23), and was a sinner herself, according to the Scriptures. She was a good woman; that was enough to fulfil God's purpose. All attempts to make her more than that are sheer folly, idolatry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">URING the “holy year” the outstanding effort of the Catholic Press in America was to do everything that lay in their power to force Judge Rutherford off the air. Several columns and sometimes a whole page in a single issue were devoted to this unmanly and un-American way of doing things. One of the chief offenders was the Cleveland </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Universe Bulletin.</span><span class="font9"> The shameless list of vile appellations, and vile descriptions of Judge Rutherford’s work as Jehovah’s witness, was published in our issue of February 14, 1933, 82 masterpieces of the “accuser of the brethren”, the Devil. Under the circumstances it is a peculiar pleasure to us to note that the Catholic Press held its annual meeting for 1934 in the city of Cleveland, and that when it abjectly sent the pope a message of filial greetings and obedience he came back with a special blessing for them all, and especially for the Catholic </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font9"> and its readers.

As a reward he was given a keg of wine, two bowls of bread, a bunch of candles, two doves, two pigeons, a group of small birds, and three bird cages. He might just as well as not have had a box of toothpicks, a bag of marbles, and a half dozen Pittsburgh stogies, but nobody thought of it till too late.

St. Anthony, the man who held the Child Jesus in his arms! St. Anthony the Miracle Man of the Centuries”. Anybody can seo that if Saint Anthony, 11G2 years after Christ ascended into heaven, could enter there and pick up in his arms the One who said, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,” there would be nothing to prevent his taking charge of the premises and running everything as he liked.

Anybody who will think about it can see that when an artilleryman has planted a quart of shrapnel in this man’s gastronomic apparatus the man is no longer possessed of the devil; it has been literally blown out of him. And thus, thou seest, how the spiritual qualities of the artilleryman are brought to light. The “pope” has been accused recently of having stock in an Italian poison-gas plant; so he and the artillerymen have something in common. Wonder if he has looked into this new scheme of treating shrapnel with acids, so that the patient surely dies in four hours after the pieces enter his breadbasket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">HE Catholic hierarchy is fairly falling over itself in its effort to put it up to the American people that it has grabbed the country. About every week now we hear of some new division of the United States government or the New York city government mentioned in such a way as to indicate that it is in some way ofli-oially connected with the Roman church. The latest is the third annual communion breakfast of the Brooklyn and Queens Holy Name Society of the Department of Sanitation; more than 3,500 city employees, in the St. George Hotel, after they had all attended mass in a near-by church. If a street sweeper wants to stop cussing, that is his right; and if he wants to be a Catholic, that is his right; but the combination of the street sweeping department with the Catholic church does not just suit. In New York city's civic center, in the very heart of it, a Catholic church has been left standing in such a position that it greatly injures the architectural appearance of a city court building that cost millions of dollars. It is strategically left in a place where it can be readily made to appear to the ignorant and unthinking that it is a part of the city government, as, in fact, it dearly longs to be.</span></p>

It seems that if you want a job or some money, or want to get into business, or what not, you take it up with St. Jude; and on account of the fact that he is a relative of the Lord, you can get almost anything you want if you pay the priest for it. Here are cases Numbers 10921 to 10936 inclusive. The numbering probably started at 10,000; that is the way the railroads used to do with freight cars. If you start with too small a number it doesn't look like anything. No names are given; the reason for that is readily apparent. It is hard enough to make up the stories themselves without having to manufacture the names and addresses. One man was out of work; he promised to do the right thing by Jude if he got a job. The result was that Jude came across with a job that pays £2 a week; not so much, but the times are hard and it is a lot better than nothing. Another man wanted to pass an examination. Don’t know how Jude helped on this, but it seems that he helped. Another man wanted to get into business. He promised to divide with Jude, and Jude must have found out about it, for he sent him a flock of customers. Another man got his rent reduced and also got a roomer. All in all, it seemed that Jude stepped on the gas in good shape and used his pull to good advantage, so why shouldn’t we boost him? If a saint does a batch of first-class, No. 1 stunts and we don’t say anything about it in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> he might get sore and lie down on the job; and that would be just too bad—for the priest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font9"> FRIEND has handed us a printed form of confession, in use in a Polish Catholic church at Passaic, N. J. It is intended to help the sinner think of the sins he is supposed to have committed. Eleven different kinds of supposed sins are named, and it is interesting that seven of these are not mentioned in the Scriptures :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have missed Mass on Sundays about 2 times a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was disobedient to my parents about 10 times a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was cursing about 5 times a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was stealing money, about 10 dollars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I did not listen to my teacher, about 3 times a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I did not say my morning and evening prayers, about 4 times.</span></p>

She says it makes her think of the colored lady in a church in the South. The pastor was showing lantern slides supposed to show how nice it would be to be in heaven. Some rascal slipped in a very naughty slide in place of the heaven scene. The colored lady was the heroine of it. The reason the pastor showed the heaven slide was to encourage people to pray, so they could get to heaven when they died. But when the dame saw her slide come on and recognized herself in it, she rose and went out like a rocket. As she passed the pastor she said, ‘‘Out of my way, Niggah, I does my own praying.” The subscriber thinks she would rather do her own praying than to have the pope do it for her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend I. McHugh, The Catholic Church, Hethe, Bicester, England, thinks of two reasons why people should send him money. The first is that in a certain year in the fifteenth century, on April 25, all the church bells in Genazzano, Italy, were rung without human hands, and the angels came through the clouds bearing a beautiful fresco for a new church; and the other is that the nun Walburga died in the year 779, and from the year 1042 a miraculous, tasteless, odorless, transparent, oily fluid exudes from her bones during four months of each year. That all sounds interesting, but just how the “Reverend” McHugh rings in on this thing, or on either of these things, in the year 1934, is the prize puzzle. However, “Reverend” McHugh takes pains to say that “all letters received will be cordially acknowledged”; and that is sump’n, ain't it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font9">N THE City Home for Dependents, on Welfare island, New York city, Catherine Man-nigan, an inmate, sat in a chair for three days with broken ribs before being taken to the hospital; in one ward there were forty-five inmates and bnt two nightgowns; among the attendants for 2,000 inmates there was but one registered nurse; the attendants, chosen for their political ability, stole cream and butter from the blind and made up for it by bathing them in water that had been used over and over again; the attendants often went to bed and set inmates to do their work of seeing that none strayed out during the night—the inmates stayed up all night, while the attendants slept. Mary Schwartz, over 70 years of age, very feeble, and receiving no pay, was compelled to work from 4:45 a.m. to 7: 00 p.m., making beds, bathing patients and mending stockings. An aged woman, dying, was tied to a chair with a sheet, to keep her quiet, instead of being sent to a hospital. Another woman received no care for an infected finger for ten days, when the infection had spread to her elbow. People who did not know the first thing about nursing unhesitatingly prescribed for inmates and thus often caused their deaths. When the doctors prescribed, the attendants could not understand the prescriptions, and did as they pleased. Bandages, improperly adjusted on inmates in the first place, were frequently unchanged for a week at a time. Inmates who could not pay, and had nothing that could be stolen, were simply out of luck.</span></p>

There was one lady, Mrs. Mathilda Beecher, who had $9,000; she was SO years of age, expected soon to die, and sought to arrange for an elaborate funeral. The superintendent of the home, at last accounts in hiding, got Mrs. Beecher to turn the $9,000 over to his wife. At length the lady died, and when the funeral came off she was buried in a dress that cost $11, accompanied by $5 worth of flowers. Looks as if the one who got the $9,000 could have spared enough change to make it two bouquets instead of one. Another inmate, Stephen Mahon, eighty-seven years of age, was also induced to part with $1,000 in cash and an estate of $5,000. Patrick C. Kane, another inmate, was robbed of $3,000 in cash.

<p><span class="font8">Hollywood, California</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May 24, 1934</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">William Cardinal O’Connell Archbishop of Boston:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Hollywood Scandal of World, Says Cardinal”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are the headlines that greet me on the front page of Hollywood </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen News</span><span class="font8"> of Maj’ 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How flattering! thought I; and what is the charge ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here it is, word for word:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Denouncing screen stars ‘with their unutterable disregard of every decent convention of life, with their three or four or five or six or seven husbands, with beautiful clothes, and what might be called beautiful faces but are only masks’, the cardinal asked:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Can any decent woman look on that sort of life as not being a horrible thing to avoid, as a contagion? How can you go and sit through a performance of that kind, cariied on by people with an openly scandalous reputation, and pour money into their laps by the million?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thunder over Mexico was not in it at the righteous indignation that arises in me at the hypocritical charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, as a decent woman (but let me remind you, Mr. Cardinal, 1he Word of God says, “If we saj’ we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us”), I propose to answer your charges and lift my pen, not in defense of individuals, but in defense of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His servants ye are whom ye serve; so, claiming to be a representative of Christianity, let me point you to Matthew 21: 23-32. A conversation ensues between Jesus and the chief priests of the temple, those who profess to know God and keep His commandments. Mark the closing verses to the narrative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus saith unto them (the chief priests), “Verily I saj’ unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto j’ou in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Truly, history is repeating itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your accusations against the screen stars of Hollywood remind me of the hypocrites who brought forth the woman taken in adulterj’, saj’ing, “This woman was taken in the very act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Note, Mr. Cardinal, they forgot to bring along the man—the other sinner. I note you likewise in your charge leave the men out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, the screen stars with their three or four or five or six or seven husbands, what would Jesus say of them—Oh, you horrible things, keep away; you </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font8">contagious? I think not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is recorded how He met a woman at the well of Samaria. She had five husbands. The Perfect One said, “Give me to drink.” Her frankness and intelligence are admirable as the conversation ensues between them. With what grace He said unto her, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘I </span><span class="font8">am the Christ.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Note, Mr. Cardinal, this is the only incident recorded where our Lord said these words and openlj' acknowledged who He was—to a woman with five husbands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely, He looked not upon her as a horrible thing to avoid, but perhaps saw in her the idealist seeking a perfect man, that which she never met until she beheld Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What condescending grace! How we admire Uis understanding heart!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Solomon, the wise, said: “In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.” “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.”. “Wisdom is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom; but with all thy getting, get understanding.” Now get it, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next charge is—the beautiful clothes. Well, that is not so bad. You admit they are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">beautiful </span><span class="font8">clothes. That is more than I can saj’ of the clothes in a recent news reel I saw of the pope and his cardinals in Vatican City. (Mark well, I am not entering into personalities, but just stating facts.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Frankly, I thought it the most repugnant dress parade I had ever seen. Men in women’s skirts and lace aprons and epaulets and everj’ contraption to belittle manhood!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is truth when I saj' the words of St. Paul came to me as I beheld the sight: “Let no man beguile you from the simplicity which is in Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be careful, Mr. Cardinal, that the blood of the innocents is not found in the skirts of your garments, as the prophet Jeremiah says. These old prophets surely said some scathing things about the priests of Israel (and they claimed to be God’s people!).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The words recorded in Hosea 6: 6, I advise you te ponder over: “For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.” Think of this the next time you are burning incense!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As for the masks—how do you know what they wear? Might I ask, have j’ou been to a show, or perhaps going Hollywood, or, by chance, just making ‘waist’ places glad?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man will look at the outward appearance!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now j’ou ask me (as a decent woman), first, how </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">can look on that sort of life? My answer </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is—as </span><span class="font8">Christ would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Secondly, you ask: “How can j’ou go and sit</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">through a performance of that kind, carried on by people of an openly scandalous reputation, and pour money into their laps by the million?” Oh, thou hypocrite! first take the beam out of your own eye, and then take the mote out of your sister’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I </span><span class="font8">could not pour millions into their laps, for I have not got them; but if I had, there is a greater chance of the stars’ getting it than the racket you are in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is plain speech—such as you presented to the thousand members of Forresters at Swampscott, Massachusetts, May 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Perhaps you don’t understand what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Get that, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I remind you of that performance recently recorded in all the leading newspapers of America: Making a saint of Mother Cabrini. The performance was to cost one million dollars! Cardinal Mundelein, leading actor, and the poor little Sisters of the Order Mother Cabrini so nobly supported had to dole up the million before “Mother” could be a saint! Alas! Dante’s hell was paved with good intentions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Say, Mr. Cardinal, decent women are not such fools out here in Hollywood to believe God’s salvation is bought with money. We are saved by grace; and that not of ourselves; it is the gift of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are no more children tossed about with every doctrine by the sleight of man and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, as St. Paul warned us in Ephesians 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Luke 16:13 says: “Ye can not serve God and mammon.” And to the Pharisees, the religious instructors of the people, our Lord continued: “Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.” Get that, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You have judged and condemned the ‘stars of Hollywood ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppose, in the light of God’s Word, you judge yourself, and see where you come off. Will you be a publican in spirit or a Pharisee? Lord, be merciful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Come now, let us reason together. Great sinners often become great saints, and it doesn’t take a million dollars to make the transition either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the wife of one husband,</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>A Protest to the Purgatorian Society</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font9">HE price list or time table of the Purgatorian Society, of 258 Pine St., Buffalo, N. Y., is very confusing. The idea is that you get so many days off from your just share in the “fires of purgatory’’ fpr saying such and such things. In certain instances the prayers must be made every day for a month, in others with holy water, in others while looking at the sacrament, in others in time of temptation, etc. That is all O.K., probably, though none of these things are mentioned in the Bible. But, setting these aside, there is a big divergence in the number of days one gets off for saying certain things. Now, for instance, here is a 9-worder: “Jesus, my God, I love Thee above all things’’; it brings 50 days. Yet another 9-worder, “Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, pray for us,” brings 100 days. An 8-worder, “0 Mary, our hope, be propitious to us,” brings 200 days; but another 8-worder, “Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us,” brings 300 days. The logic of this is not clear. Why not run “purgatory” on the level? If 8 words will help a fellow to be cool and comfortable for 300 days, why must another man who says 9 words get only 50 days because he says the wrong thing? Don’t you see ? The thing is not just. And then we have still worse inconsistencies. Just for saying “Jesus! Mary!” and nothing else, mind you, not another thing, a man gets 300 days in the frigidaire department, while for saying twelve times as much, namely, “Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Most Precious Blood of Jesus Christ in satisfaction for my sins and for the wants of Holy Church,” the sayer gets but 100 days. He does twelve times as much work for one-third of the time in the frigidaire. In fact, a close examination of 22 of these ejaculations shows that the whole system is inconsistent. Thus 16 of the ejaculations that bring 300 days apiece in the frigidaire average only 10 words long, while to get 200 days in the cooler the average number of words required is 13J, and to get an even hundred days one must produce an average of 17 words. The thing seems to run backwards, like an old Model T Ford that will climb some hills when the gas is low only by turning it around and running up backwards. To offset this, however, we have to admit that to get 50 days of good temperature the average number of words is only 8. Those interested in figures should look into this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OF SPECIAL INTEREST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As interest in the Bible and its message increases the “regularly ordained” clergy are more and more manifesting their own abysmal ignorance of and unpardonable indifference toward its contents. Unable to agree among themselves as to the significance of even the most fundamental doctrines of the Word of God, they nevertheless conspire together to keep the people from studying it for themselves with the aid of such helps as are within their reach. It is to extend a helping hand to earnest seekers after the truth that Judge Rutherford and coworkers are promulgating the Bible message in simple and direct language. The following brief talk is seventh of a series of eighteen, all of which will appear in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Soul </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By J. F. Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font9">OES every person possess an immortal soul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The only way to obtain a correct answer to that question is to read it in the Bible. What is contained in the Bible is the truth, because it is the Word of God. The correct answer to the question clears up many other confusing doctrines.- The word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font9"> means a living creature. Every living creature is a soul, and that includes men and animals. A man is a soul, but he does not possess a soul. The body and the breath of life which animates the brain and other organs together constitute a soul or creature. In Genesis 2:7 it is written: “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” This scripture says nothing about God’s giving man a soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An immortal soul would mean one which is not subject to ueath and does not die. When God created man He said to him: Tn the day that you sin you shall surely die.’ God’s law did not mean that merely the body would die, but that the man himself would cease to exist. In Ezekiel 18:4 it is written: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die”; and that alone is proof conclusive that the soul is not immortal. In Psalm 89: 48 it is written : “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?” There is not one text of the Bible that says that man has an immortal soul, but, on the contrary, all texts bearing upon the matter show that man is a mortal soul or creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The clergy teach that the soul is immortal. What is their authority for such teaching? Satan, the Devil, is the author of the false teaching that the soul is immortal. The Scriptures declare that Satan is the father of lies and always resorts to lying. He deceived Eve, the first woman, by telling a lie. It is written, in Genesis three, that Satan, that old serpent, said to Eve, in contradiction of God’s law, “Ye shall not surely die.” Satan’s purpose in telling that lie was to turn mankind away from God. Ever since then Satan has deceived men and caused religious teachers to tell the people that there is no death. Whenever you hear any company or organization of people teaching that there is no death you may know at once that Satan is the author of that teaching and that it is wholly false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan himself is not immortal. God has sentenced Satan to death, and within a short time now God will destroy Satan, together with all other wicked ones. (Hebrews 2:14) When the man Jesus was on earth He was not immortal, because it was written of Him that He was dead for three days and on the third day God raised Him up out of death. The angels are not immortal, because it is written in the Scriptures that there are wicked angels and that all the wicked God will destroy. (Psalm 145:20) Man is made lower than angels. We know from observation that men die. Who, then, is immortal? The Scriptural answer is that God alone is immortal, without beginning and without end. (1 Timothy 6:16) When God raised Christ Jesus from the dead He gave to Jesus immortality, so that He cannot die again. (Revelation 1:18) No one will ever get immortality except those who are the true followers of Christ Jesus and who remain faithful unto death. To the Christians the Scripture says: ‘Seek ye immortality.’ (Romans 2: 7) You know that a man does not seek what he already possesses. In addressing true Christians the Scriptures declare concerning the soul, that is, the man: “This mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:53) It would be entirely inconsistent for God to give every man an immortal soul and then require Christians to be faithful unto death in order to receive immortality as a reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The doctrine of the immortality of all souls is Satan’s lie, and upon that falsehood is based almost all other false teachings. Satan's purpose of instilling that lie into the mind of men is to reproach the name of Jehovah God, turn men away from God, and ensnare them in his trap and destroy them. If we rely upon the Word of God we will not go wrong. The truth is of vital importance to ail now ■who desire to go in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">[The foregoing lecture is one of a series of eighteen brief talks by Judge Rutherford now obtainable in the form of phonograph records. There are nine records in all, two talks on each disk. They may be run on any phonograph. This unusual set of instructive and helpful records is issued by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y., the purpose being to enable those who are unable to hear Judge Rutherford's talks by radio </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">have these lectures in their own homes and to share them with friends, relatives and neighbors. The talks cover important and timely Bible truths. The demand for the records has been unusual, indicating a wide interest in these encouraging messages. Inquiries regarding these records should be addressed to the Society, and not to us.]</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>The Soul Is a Worm</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">H. Comstock, pioneer, says the preacher out in the town in Illinois where he is at present witnessing has it all straightened out now. He says that the soul is the “worm that dieth not”. Comstock says that settles the soul business for him; it is a worm. It is astonishing how fast these pioneers pick up “knowledge”, especially from the clergy. And doesn’t it show, too, how dangerous it was for our parents to give us worm medicine when we were kids? But why go into that ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Two Badly Frightened Priests</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font9">WO priests of Keokuk, Iowa, became badly frightened when Leroy Moore, seven years of age, went from door to door, giving those who desired Judge Rutherford's booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font9"> an opportunity to get it upon contributing a part of the cost of printing and delivering at the door. The two priests stirred up the police department, and incidentally the whole town, with the result that they finally locked up Leroy and 65 others, two of whom were ladies over 70 years of age. Newspaper accounts accomplished wonders at the thoroughness with which they set forth things that were not true, and concealed things that were. The object, of course, was to hide the two priests that were at the bottom of the whole ridiculous performance. At 9:30 that night the 66 witnesses, including Leroy and the two elderly women, were released, none of them having violated any law, and everybody was glad that the two priests had been able to keep out of it. At one time it looked as if they would certainly be dragged in, and, of course, nobody wants to read the truth about the priests; so everybody was glad when it was all over, including the brave chief of police who manfully shoved Leroy behind the bars. The Catholics, Protestants and Jews have been having a fine time conducting lecture tours about the country explaining to the people in general that there is no such thing as intolerance in this country, and in due time they expect to get to Leroy and to the two old ladies and to tell them all about it and explain that it was all a joke anyway. And then the Millennium will have come to Keokuk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">EFERRING to the acquittal of 29 of Jehovah’s witnesses at Hesse-Darmstadt, the Berlin </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vossische Zeitung</span><span class="font9"> mentions that these faithful witnesses stated that they had continued to spread the truth in spite of prohibition because if they did discontinue to spread the Word of God they would be acting against the Bible; they denied that they are connected with the Jewish religion or with communism; from the one they arc separated by their faith in the life and death of Christ, and from the other because they reject on principle the use of violence. The court held that Jehovah’s witnesses regard all secular governments as the works of Satan, but stated that a repressive action against them is void by the Constitution of Weimar, and that no constituent state of Germany has a right to enact prohibitive decrees against the exercise of religious liberty. It is of interest that only a few weeks after this acquittal occurred Hitler’s execution of those that had planned his overthrow. These very men that Hitler put to death are the ones that had most to do with the sufferings of Jehovah's witnesses in Germany. Hitler himself, on the day this is written, is doubly accused: first, of having betrayed and disorganized the Nazi storm troops that put him in power, and, second, of having illegally sent $1,000,000 of German money to himself at Rome.</span></p>

The boy in this case was only eleven years old, but it is thought that, in time, the clergyman will be able to hit larger boys and get away with it equally well.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Test an Aluminum Cooking Utensil </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. C. T. Betts (Ohio) </span><span class="font7">(Reprinted from our issue of June 24, 1931)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">R</span><span class="font9">EGARDING aluminum cooking utensils:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The proof whether or not the kind you have is fit for cooking purposes can easily be ascertained by using them in making several experiments. This can be done by yourself, to find out whether or not they are fit to use. I would suggest the following experiments for you to make in this connection. Boil some ordinary drinking water in your aluminum kettle for half an hour; place in a clean glass jar. Let set until cool, and note whether or not you can see the white feathery poison in the bottom of your glass jar when the water is cold. This will take only an hour's time, and you should get a result that will be astonishing. The next experiment I would suggest is to color some hen’s eggs with dyes of different colors, making each dyeing process in your aluminum kettle. Note especially whether or not your eggs color according to the color they should be when dyed. If you do not get the eggs in the exact color, according to the instructions on the package, a chemical action has taken place with your dyestuffs which would also take place with various foods cooked in that container.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next experiment would be to bring some water to the boiling point, and add a little cooking soda to the water, then using a very tarnished spoon or knife, immerse one-half of the spoon or knife in the water. If this portion which has been allowed to remain in the water becomes bright and shiny, while the part outside remains discolored, you have evidence of the activity of the aluminum of this dish upon the food which would be cooked therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Make a jelly from any good fruit acid that will jell. Make the jell in the ordinary manner, and note if the product, when cold, is a nice, livery jell. If you find it soft and stringy instead, you will have evidence of a product thoroughly contaminated, saturated with aluminum hydroxid. A check could be made especially on this with an enamel or porcelain dish. If the results are the same in both your aluminum and the enamel, then the aluminum dish is O.K. to use; if not, the dish should not be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another experiment I believe would interest you, but which will take a little more time, is to make hard soap in an aluminum dish. If the soap becomes hard after being cooked in your aluminum dish, after making it in the ordinary way, your dish is O.K.; otherwise it is not fit to use. The next experiment would take the least time and trouble and would be very definite in its results. Mix the ingredients for the making of a mayonnaise dressing, using apple eider vinegar for the acid ingredient. Boil the ingredients the usual time and note the color of the product, whether it is the proper color, yellow, or has changed to a dark brownish color. If it is a bright yellow, your utensil is all right; if it is a dark color, it is not fit to use. All food specialists who give their radio talks in America are very particular in advising their hearers not to make any salads, especially shrimp or other sea food salads, in aluminum dishes. To test your dish, make one of these salads in it and let it stand till next morning. Eat salad. If you are alive the next night, your dish is all right. If dead, we advise throwing the dish away.*</span></p>

His widow has been awarded a verdict and judgment against his employers, and it is calculated that Ohio employers hereafter will be less enthusiastic than heretofore about seeing that their employees are vaccinated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font9">N </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Cancer: Its Prevention,</span><span class="font9"> a little 46-page book by H. W. Keens, M.Inst.B.Th., London, published by The C. W. Daniel Company, 4G Bernard St., W.C.l, London, England, for 1 shilling net, the author, a medical man who cured himself of cancer, helps his readers to understand that the prevention of malignancies lies with nature, not with science. He attributes the origin of cancer to the replacing of natural manure by chemical manure, the denaturization of foods by chemical treatment and preservation, and the use of aluminum for the preparation and storage of foods. Mr. Keens made countless experiments by preparing decoctions of herbs, roots, barks, berries and domestic vegetation and inorganic mineral salts in iron, tinned steel, earthenware, enamel, glass, china and aluminum containers, and always found the results different when aluminum ware was employed. In 1890 the death rate from cancer in Britain was 701 per annum per million people living. Aluminum was first used for cooking utensils, storage and receptacles for food in 1892; by 1900 the death rate from cancer had risen to 1,000 per annum per million people living. “If water in which a small pinch of common salt or soda has been dissolved is boiled in an aluminum vessel and allowed to stand for one hour in a glass container, the aluminum precipitate can be noticed by a floating, feathery deposit and milky condition. The white of an egg stirred in an aluminum pan with a spoon of the same metal causes coagulation and rapid discoloration. A jelly prepared in an aluminum mold will not set firm as when made in other molds, but will remain in a soft, stringy condition. Animals will not reauily take food or drink from aluminum containers. ... I find that when a diet of vegetables, meat and water, all prepared in aluminum ware, is taken regularly a state of morbidity is set up and that small tumors form in the body.” Mr. Keens gives a wealth of information as to how one can develop in his own person a cancel’ or a well-defined case of diabetes through the careful use of aluminum cooking utensils, but we have hardly room to reproduce it. If interested you might send and get his little book; your relatives will find it among your effects after you have gone.*</span></p>

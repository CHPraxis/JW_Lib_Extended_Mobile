<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>This and That About the Human Body</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE human body, like all other bodies, animate and inanimate, has size, measured up and down and around, and weight, and exterior and interior. In this article we shall not attempt to exhaust the subject; in fact, the human body, with its various organs and divisions, forms a well-nigh inexhaustible subject for study, and we do not anticipate that we shall do much more than merely touch upon that subject here and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the size of the human body, up and down, or its height, this varies a great deal, many of us being short and the rest of us tall (excepting, of course, those who are just average). Whatever may be the advantage of the tall, short and average arrangement, it at least makes for variety; and variety is something the human creature seems to crave. Nothing is more distasteful to the mind than sameness. The size of the individual is something about w<sup>7</sup>hich he has very little to say, particularly his height, and we have the Bible’s authority for it that no one can by “being anxious” add a cubit to his stature. That being the case, it is just as well for everybody to be satisfied with what he is, and not to fret about that which cannot be adjusted. When all is said and done, there is no merit in being either tall or short or neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it comes to growth or lack of it, it is probable that those who are moderately short would not want to be of the size of John Aasen, of San Francisco, who measures 8 feet 9 inches and weighs 406 pounds. Doors are generally not made more than seven feet high; and so, anyone who is so indiscreet as to grow taller than that is put to considerable inconvenience in getting through the world. Those of our readers who are rather taller than the average may be glad that they are not so tall as John. Again, they would probably dislike the idea of “growing” shorter, the way Lillie Meyers, of Brooklyn, New York, did during the years from 1922 to 1927, in which time she lost ten inches in height. One instinctively shrinks from the thought of having to undergo such a reducing process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is said, on good authority, that lying down increases one’s height, or length, sometimes as much as an inch, depending upon the individual’s size to begin with. It seems that men gain a little more than women when reclining. But all this is only temporary, for the increased height disappears in the course of the day’s activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">W'hen a boy, however, finds that he has grown to be six feet eight inches tall at the age of 14, he might be excused for trying to have something done about it. Willard Akin, of Denver, at least, thinks so, and has submitted to hypodermic injections of secretions taken from the frontal lobe of the pituitary gland. It may work, but it sounds risky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just a word about the way an individual’s height may be “distributed”. Some are longlegged and short above the waist, while others are proportionately shorter in the lower part of the body, and long from the waist up. In view of this fact we may question the claim of European scientists that they have worked out tables by which the height of prehistoric persons can be estimated by measuring one or two bones. We make no bones about saying that we don’t believe it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Skin and Beneath</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">As to the size of the body, around, we shall consider that a little later in the course of this ‘learned’ treatise. Just now we want to take a look at the outside, that is, the skin. The saying that beauty is only skin-deep is not true. The skin cannot be good-looking if it is not healthy, and it cannot be healthy if the body over which it is stretched is unhealthy. That sounds logical, doesn’t it? On the other hand, an unlovely skin will detract immensely from an otherwise well-proportioned and good-looking body or face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The skin which covers the human body is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">made up of two layers. The outer layer is protective as well as ornamental. The inner layer contains the glands, blood vessels and nerves, all of them, of course, very minute. A healthy skin is slightly moist (only slightly) and soft and pliable. If the skin is dry or oily the glands are not doing their work as they should. It doesn’t do much good to apply something on the outside. Proper food and needful rest, together with cleanliness, will do more good than all the lotions and creams that the drug stores offer. It is not necessary to use cream instead of water to cleanse the face. Perhaps you won’t believe it, but men have better complexions than women, taking them all in all. We hesitate to say this, but the truth must be told. Vegetables and fruits help to keep the system clean and the skin clear. Some advocate applying carrot juice and pineapple juice to the skin. Better apply it from the inside, however. That will do more good, benefiting not only the skin, but the rest of your organism.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Covering and Changing the Skin</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of the skin, a Japanese physician had his entire body covered with thin paper, which was then removed, cut into flat pieces, and measured. Doctor Takahira found that it took 16 square feet of skin to cover him. He is 5 feet 6 inches tall. It is obviously wrong to refer to the skin as one’s birthday suit. The skin, together with the rest of the body, is changed every seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If two-thirds of the body surface is burned the victim cannot possibly live. The skin performs an important function, that of breathing out the poisonous substances which are developed as a result of the activity of the body. Sometimes, in theatrical performances, a person is covered with gold paint to make him look like something he is not, an angel, for instance. (We don’t know who was responsible for the idea that angels have gold bodies.) Such gilding or other ornamentation of the skin, if not removed quickly, will cause the death of the individual, and the whole business is a risky one at best. The paint must be applied over something else to prevent its being absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not uncommon for savages and other uncivilized people to attempt an improvement on the work of the Creator by tattooing the skin with disfiguring marks, the entire body sometimes being covered with ludicrous designs and crude pictures. The Hebrews, when in divine favor, were forbidden to make any marks on their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sun baths are a tonic to the skin, and are said to be beneficial because they decrease the sensitiveness of the skin. It is the ultra-violet rays, not the heat of the sun, that produce sunburn. Blonds are likely to develop freckles instead of an even tan. Some think that freckles and tan are nature’s way of providing a shield for the delicate nerve endings beneath the skin. Waves of high frequency are used in the treatment of disorders requiring internal warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">On Keeping Warm</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">American workmen employed close to a shortwave (10 meters) wireless station developed high temperatures as a result of the waves. This gave doctors an idea for the treatment of patients requiring maximum exposure to sun and air. Their beds being placed between two aerials, it was possible to dispense with bedclothes. The waves kept them warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The human body constantly gives off heat, and is therefore something like a stove. Instruments devised to measure the amount of heat given off by persons under different conditions show that a man with malarial fever and chills stores up large amounts of heat without affecting his surface temperature. In the normal body 65 percent of the heat generated is radiated, as heat which we do not need must be disposed of in some way. At the normal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit an individual sends out enough heat every hour to raise three pints of water from room temperature to the boiling point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another item about the skin. People who drink too much alcohol often have red noses, and Dr. B. Kauders, of Vienna, has discovered that this is the result of damage to the part of the brain which governs the operation of the smaller blood vessels, resulting in a continually distended condition of these vessels in the nose and other parts of the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was nothing the matter with the skin of S. H. Robison, of Greenville, Ohio, so far as anybody could see, but in the space of five months he changed from a white man to a black man, as far as his color is concerned. Outside, or inside, of that he is just as good as he was before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How Much to Weigh</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now as to the weight of the human body. Here is a table which represents the average weight according to height and age. When all is said and done, the human creature refuses to he tabled and labeled, and so considerable allowance must be made for individual differences. Just because two persons happen to be of the same height is by no means a proof that they should weigh exactly the same. But here is the table:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font5">A person should weigh about two pounds for every inch of his height, according to another authority. This would make no considerable variation from the above table. Generally speaking, women will weigh slightly less and men rather more than indicated in the table. If you are ten percent above the average, don’t worry. If you are ten percent under, you need not worry, either, but you might look into your eating habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Insurance companies consider an underweight person a better risk than one who is overweight. Thin people are not so likely to succumb to diseases, but are more susceptible to influenza or tuberculosis than are those who are overweight. The latter are liable to such ills as diabetes and gall bladder trouble, as well as high blood pressure and fatty degeneration of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one is very thin he is likely to be conscious of his meal (after eating it), and to be troubled with a feeling of heaviness. This is due to the fact that there is nothing to support the stomach properly. This organ tends to hang down too low and to create discomfort, in such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are twenty-five or more pounds underweight show twice the number of deaths from tuberculosis as compared with those of average or more than average weight. Fat folks do not often die of this disease.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark15"></a>(t</sup>We Glory in Our Fat”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Not all fat people are dissatisfied with their condition. One of them said, “We glory in our fat, our laughter, good temper, sociability, our appreciation of food and drink and company. We would rather die in full possession of our faculties in middle age than totter about in scrawny-legged misery a few extra years, lean and unlovely. . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One genial soul, “Aunt Mamie” Williams, of Jacksonville, Florida, a colored mammy who at one time tipped the scales at 798 pounds, accused troublesome neighbors of causing her to lose 200 pounds and to make her “feel poorly”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many folks tend to take on weight toward middle age. This process is called the “middleage spread”. It is often considered to be a normal and natural thing, but is likely to be the result of wrong eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is also a tendency, particularly among women, to increase in weight in winter. Cause, same as in preceding paragraph, and less activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When not replenished by food the average human body loses about three pounds in weight daily, due to evaporation of moisture through the lungs and pores and the losses due to activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fat people often make heroic efforts to reduce. Some unwise young women, only slightly overweight, have brought about their death by “slimming”. Nitrophenol drugs, often used for this purpose, are dangerous. The effort to reduce by improper methods or to an unreasonable degree may also result in undermining the constitution to the extent of bringing about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> nervous breakdown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One radio corporation which broadcasts health exercises stated that in the space of one year 82,000 persons wanted to know how to reduce. Reducing remedies such as salts, tablets or pills, advertised as safe, harmless and efficient, bring results, but they are neither safe nor harmless, and should be avoided. There are proper ways and means of eliminating excess fat and reducing the weight to reasonable proportions. Figures published by the Public Health Service indicate that it is an advantage to be under the average weight when middle age is reached.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>How to Reduce</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The raw food diet helps reduce weight without injury to the body. One of the benefits resulting from this diet is that the intake of common table salt is greatly reduced or entirely eliminated. Persons eating foods seasoned with salt have in their organism from two to four ounces of this inorganic substance, which must be kept in solution. This requires 112 ounces (seven pounds) of water for every ounce of salt. The water which makes up a large percentage of the human body is chemically very similar to sea water. Some of the constituents of this “solution” are beneficial and necessary; others, harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one goes on a raw food diet the salt deposit is gradually eliminated and the excessive amount of water required to keep it in solution is no longei' necessary. Experiments have proved that the use of salt will substantially increase the weight of the user. When it is discontinued the weight is reduced, particularly in the case of fat persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It undoubtedly requires a considerable amount of determination for a person who inclines to be fat to deny himself the foods which he is likely to crave the most. But the benefits resulting from a reducing diet and a subsequently properly balanced diet will undoubtedly repay the “faster” for his self-denial. Besides, fat is considered the foe of beauty. A bulging waistline, a double chin or a generally overstutfed appearance is deemed undesirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We give here, in separate paragraphs, suggestions from various sources as to what should he done to reduce, in addition to the raw food diet already mentioned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Get out in the fresh air, take plenty of exercise, drink nothing but pure water, eat only raw fruits and raw vegetables without seasoning, and go to bed early, getting all the sleep you can. This recipe is guaranteed to bring about wonderful physical and mental improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Proper feeding, proper exercise, proper elimination and massage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Massage reduces only the weight of the masseur. Sweat rooms and Turkish baths are no more effective. Generate your own heat if reduction of weight is your object. A cold bath of five minutes, at 59 degrees Fahrenheit, will cause the loss of the energy represented by one egg or nine oysters. (Then why eat the oysters in the first place?)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. Skating is a wonderful “reducer”. It does not encourage undue muscular development and causes no ugly saggings where the flesh has subsided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Diet and exercise. The fattening foods are: All fats and oils, whether of animal or of vegetable origin; all starchy foods; and all concentrated sweet food. Obviously such foods should be avoided. Fish, eggs, buttermilk, the succulent vegetables and fresh juicy fruits are not fattening.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">And, in addition to these, there is horseback riding and walking. No doubt climbing stairs and knocking on doors is also effective.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Benefit of Exercise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Reviewing all these enthusiastic recommendations, probably derived largely from experience, we believe it will be agreed that they are worth considering. Obviously overeating is likely to result in excess weight. This is not by any means the invariable result. Many people eat far more than they should and still remain thin or of normal proportions. Nor is it wise for fat people to entirely eliminate nourishing foods from the diet, though a gradual reduction is not only a good thing, but imperative. Natural foods are the least likely to tempt the individual to overeat. Whole-wheat bread, unpolished rice, and raw foods of all kinds do not unduly excite the appetite. Under normal conditions the appetite would be a safe guide to the kinds and quantities of food that should be eaten; but, with so much highly seasoned and refined food, it is easy to eat to excess and still fail to get the proper elements for the body’s needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for exercises, there is much to be said for them, and something against them. Dr. Jesse F. Williams, professor of physical education, made the statement that morning setting-up exercises and a cold plunge are injurious more often than beneficial. Arthur E. Bagley, director of the health programs broadcast by the Metropolitan Insurance Company, has close to a million letters testifying to the benefits of morning exercises in “tuning up the physical and nervous organism”, correcting posture and building up the individual’s energy. Exercises, when properly balanced, bring into play all the 400 or more muscles in the human body. But every person must be treated as an individual case. What would be too much effort for one would be too little for another, and vice versa. The individual’s inclinations should not be entirely disregarded. When exercise becomes burdensome and entirely distasteful it is not likely to do much good. To go through a stipulated number of movements regardless of the feelings and inclinations of the person is as unprofitable as eating so many meals a day or drinking just so many glasses of water just because someone said that is the thing to do.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>How Much Should One Exercise?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Gentle exercise stimulates the flow of digestive fluids in the stomach, but severe, protracted and violent exercise retards the flow, which is subsequently greatly increased. Gentle exercise hastens the emptying of the stomach; severe exertion delays digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the heart is healthy, exercise is all right; but if the heart has been affected by disease, one must be careful about exercising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One German physical-training instructor uses animals as examples of the proper way to exercise. After a given number of lessons the pupil becomes proficient in imitating an animal such as, perhaps, the monkey. A good many persons manage quite well without the lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A better suggestion is to watch the children at play and note their enthusiasm and naturalness, or, better still, play with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One authority says that exercises should be slow, smooth, regular and rhythmical. That sounds all right, but we have often wondered what makes anyone an “authority” in a thing of that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special apparatus is undesirable. A man of fifty needs a gentler form of exercise than the man of thirty. Moderation should be the rule, and fresh air is an indispensable ally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Labor is not “exercise”. The man doing hard work is most likely to be overdeveloped in one way and underdeveloped in another. Exercises will offset the uneven use of the body, bringing into play muscles not used in performing the routine tasks of the shop and office. Spinal curvatures have been measurably corrected by means of counteracting exercises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Physical Culture</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That there is something in this exercise business, or physical culture, is evidenced by the fact that Bernarr Facfadden made a tremendous success of his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Culture</span><span class="font5"> magazine, incidentally becoming a millionaire. If he was not the pioneer of physical culturists, he is certainly among the few who have kept before the minds of the public the importance of exercise and other physical culture ideas. Walter Camp, with his “daily dozen”, was another leader in the field. When it comes to adopting forms of exercise recommended by enthusiastic physical culturists there is an endless variety to choose from. One recommends this kind of exercises, and another something else. But the basic idea of them all is that the muscles must be used— all the muscles. The degree and manner in which they shall be exercised is a matter of individual judgment. Undoubtedly almost everyone is much benefited by some form of exercise. It has done wonders for many sickly and underdeveloped individuals, particularly when combined with other health measures. The effort of some ambitious youths to develop bulging muscles has sometimes resulted disastrously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reasonable objective of exercise should be the development of a natural body, evenly distributed muscles, and a reasonable degree of endurance. Strength and endurance are different things. Strength depends upon the muscles; endurance, upon the state of the blood. Care should be taken not to develop the body at the expense of the internal organs. Gymnastics, therefore, should be followed not merely to develop the muscles here and there, but the entire man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The healthy human body seeks for activity of some kind. It demands the opportunity to use the strength it possesses. A healthy person will not sit still unless induced to do so by artificial surroundings. Looking at a ball game, sitting in a motion-picture house, riding in an automobile, are results of civilization which bring with them the disuse and consequent deterioration of the muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amounts of physical activity said to be necessary to healthy persons at various ages are four hours daily at the age of five, five hours from seven to nine, six hours from nine to eleven, five hours from eleven to thirteen, four hours from thirteen to sixteen, three hours from sixteen to eighteen, two from eighteen to twenty, and one hour daily for persons over twenty years of age. This, no doubt, represents the minimum amount of activity necessary to maintain good health. More is better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Exercise benefits the body because it stimulates the action of the heart and sends larger quantities of blood to the various parts of the body, in turn benefiting both the vital organs and the muscles.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Give Nature a Chance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Children seem to grow and develop with a fair amount of symmetry even when no systematic exercises are prescribed by learned professors. Common sense tells us that if we give nature a fair chance the results will not be wholly disappointing. The trouble is that grown-ups force themselves to follow an unnatural course for financial or other considerations. Necessity compels them to work at unhealthful occupations for long hours at a stretch, and the additional burden of forced exercises after a weary day of labor does not appear either desirable or necessary. But a half hour devoted to such balancing exercises will yield far more beneficial results than indulging the apparent demand of the body for rest. Children incline to make a game out of their tasks, or injecting into their activities the spontaneous spirit of play. They do things with a hop, skip and a jump, and wise elders will not forget that when all is said and done they are but children grown a little bigger. A grandma who skips and romps with her grandchildren is grandma in name only. Actually she is a playmate and pal, and, incidentally, a lot of fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Forcing all the children in a class to go through the same kind and the same amount of exercise is stupid. Each pupil is an individual case, and group tactics are unjust to every member of the class, whether advantaged or disadvantaged by them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Walking for Exercise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Walking as an exercise is better than sitting still while riding in an automobile. Indeed, stepping along briskly with chest out and arms swinging is a builder of vitality. This seems to be going out of fashion, and so golf is considered a necessary diversion by those who have the time and money to indulge in the pastime. But walking is cheaper, and to most of us just as much fun, especially out of town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One hundred and twenty steps a minute is the standard pace for the army. A faster pace requires the expenditure of more effort. Perhaps the best pace for the individual is the one that happens to meet the inclination of the moment. Of course, sauntering along is hardly an exercise. One writer says that increasing the pace to 125, 130 or even 140 steps a minute is good for one who wants to reduce. We are told that the results will surprise us. Surplus weight will be reduced, girth diminished, the respiratory effort deepened, and the heart strengthened. You will tingle with the glow of the increased circulation and the healthy perspiration, and by following the walk with a hot soapy scrub and a cold shower, together with five or ten minutes on your back, you will feel that you could &quot;whip your weight in wildcats”. All of w’hich sounds good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Exercise, physical activity, is not a rest from brain-work. In a school where pupils studied hard the entire week, the principal &quot;rested” them by taking them for an all-day hike one day a week. The result was a lot of cases of typhoid, grippe and brain-fag. An adjacent school, though housed in an unsanitary building, had no sickness at all. The body requires rest and relaxation. The provision for sabbaths (rest days) made in the old Jewish law, while pictorial, appear to have had a very practical reason back of them, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nervous system is a very important part of the organism. Worry, excitement and noise irritate the nervous system and interfere with both work and rest. Efficiency is noticeably reduced by noises and disturbances, and rest periods are robbed of much of their effectiveness by discordant sounds and surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Massage is beneficial to the body, but as a reducer of surplus fat it does the &quot;massager” more good than the “massagee”. The Hindus, Persians, Greeks and Romans were familiar with the art long before the Swedes and Finns made it their specialty. The Chinese have been using it for more than three thousand years. In Japan blind men often specialize in massage treatments, and are frequently seen, or rather heard, loudly advertising their profession in the streets, just as peddlers of various kinds may still be heard to make their presence known in American cities.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The Weaker Sex?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of strength of body, women are not by any means the weaker sex. In many European and Asiatic countries the women work as hard as the men, and frequently they work harder. Women are said to have greater tenacity of life than men. In hospitals male patients will make more fuss and give the nurses more trouble than patients of the opposite sex, nine cases out of ten. The average woman stands pain better than the average man. So the doctors tell us; and they should know. To every 29 girls that die at birth there are 36 boys that die. Women live longer than men; and though they are weaker than men in some respects, they are stronger in other respects. Indian women, according to an observer, &quot;are made for labor; and one of them can carry or haul as much as two men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whereas the average woman is 5 feet 4 inches high, the average man is 5 feet 8 inches. When it comes to length of body, however, there is an average difference of only one inch, which indicates that the average woman has better vital organs than the average man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now we have about reached the end of our remarks about the human body. Not much has been said about the kind of exercises that should be adopted to keep it fit. Natural movements, such as turning, bending, and moving various parts of the body are the best. They should be continued long enough to induce a slight feeling of fatigue, but no more. Those who are naturally strong will require more strenuous exercises than the slight-figured type. The latter should not be too anxious for muscular development, but seek rather to keep the body in trim by making use of every muscle for a short period daily. Regularity in exercising is of importance. Intermittent and irregular efforts yield no satisfactory results. As strength increases, the exercises may be made somewhat more strenuous, depending upon the individual. Let the objective be to have a balanced and natural body and one that enables you to perform the work that you are called upon to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Next War </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Skillicorn (Australia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Reprinted from Newcastle </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald and Miners’ Advocate)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">T IS quite evident that we are again on the verge of what will probably be the most frightful war ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding the fact that we were assured that the last war was a war to end wars, we are now about to be plunged into another infernal blood bath, with all its misery and degradation, its poison gases, pestilence, and devastation, anguish, death, and desolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This means that thousands of the virile youths of the various countries are to be cut off in their bloom in a war which is to be waged in support of vested interest, in a war to enrich pious tricksters and consummate scoundrels, who in the last war enhanced profit from every shot that was fired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This statement is borne out by an admission in the British House of Commons which shows that Britain paid royalty to Krupp’s, and the German government paid royalty to British capitalists, while the soldiers were shattering each other to fragments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of such heinous, barbarous, and pernicious transactions, I would ask: Is there any sane father who will advise his sons to participate in the next war? Is there any mother who will be willing to sacrifice her sons to be slaughtered by guns which send a ton of steel at a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet a second? We were told that a grateful country would never forget those who participated in the last war, and in some cases that promise has been honored. For instance, Admiral Beatty received a Government grant of £100,000, Lord Haig £100,000, Admiral Jellicoe £50,000, General French £50,000, General Allenby £50,000, Generals Plumer, Rawlinson, Home, and Byng each £30,000, General Hankey £25,000, Generals Robertson, Birdwood, Wilson, Trenchard, and Admirals Madden, Sturdee, Roebuck, Keyes, and Tyrwhitt each £10,000. They will also get ordinary pensions and retiring allowances. But this does not apply to those unfortunates who occupied the trenches. They do not receive £100,000 grants. On the contrary, we find that in England their dependents in June and July, 1915, were actually starving. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Dispatch</span><span class="font5"> stated on July 2 that they had over 5,000 complaints, and were receiving up to 600 complaints per day. ‘We find that innumerable veterans have ended their days in workhouses, including those of the gallant Six Hundred.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the year 1496 B.C. to A.D. 1862 there were 3,130 years of war. Within the last three centuries there have been 286 w<sup>r</sup>ars in Europe. From the year 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1860 more than 8,000 treaties of peace were concluded. The average time they remained in force was two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pensions for All over Sixty</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T\r. F. E. Townsend, of Long Beach, California, wants to bring prosperity by a pension of $200 monthly to every citizen, man or woman, over 60 who will retire from further labor for gain and will take oath to spend the pension within 30 days from receiving the same. The fund would be raised by a sales tax.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Why, you know there’s a big surplus of last year’s crop. I don’t need you to plant another this year. I’ve got enough goat-skin clothes to last me a lifetime. My house needs no repairs. I can gather turtle eggs myself. There’s an overproduction. When I need you I’ll send for you. You needn’t wait around here.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“ ‘What shall I do, master ?’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“ ‘I guess I’ll starve, master. May I stay here until I do, or shall I swim beyond your riparian rights and drown or starve there?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Tve thought of something, Friday. I don’t like to carry my garbage down to the shore each day. You may stay and do that. Then whatever is left of it after my dog and cat have been fed you may eat. You’re in luck.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Thank you, master. That is true charity.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘One thing more, Friday. This island is overpopulated. Fifty percent of the people are unemployed. We are undergoing a severe depression and there is no way that I can see to end it. No one but a charlatan would say that he could. So keep a lookout and let no one land here to settle, and if any ship comes don’t let them land any goods of any kind. You must be protected against foreign labor. Conditions are fundamentally sound, though, and prosperity is just around the corner.’ ”</span></p>

Filene, prominent merchant, stated that what broke America was that “when the machines became so productive that the masses could buy only a fraction of their products, the machines had to be run on part time. That meant that millions lost their jobs. And that meant that the masses had still less buying power than before, so less was bought and more machines were shut down and unemployment and poverty increased. Poverty, not because of any scarcity, but because we had learned how to produce so much”.</span></p>

At present 2,000 meetings a week are being held in that city. The membership is estimated at 250,000, increasing 5,000 a day. Each is known by number arid gives oath not to reveal the time, place or reason for the meeting, nor anything seen or heard, nor the name of any person attending. Announced aims:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To learn why millions of deserving American citizens are now distressfully unemployed and why an increasing majority of these worthy citizens can never again hope to secure steady or satisfactory employment unless intelligent action is taken by the people themselves; to learn how and why the national tax and debt burden is hopelessly increasing out of all bounds of reason and resources; to learn the true character of a social structure that would be required to function to the greatest advantage of all the American people under conditions of plenty; and, finally, to learn if and how the American standard of living can be advanced by the application of reason to compare favorably with technical skill, equipment, machinery and natural resources of the nation. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society projects a new kind of money, but is anti-communistic. It proposes a new social State, with the abolition of profit, but without any change in the Constitution. At a meeting in the Hollywood Bowl, June 23, 1934, 25,000 people paid admissions to hear Jonathan F. Glendon explain the purposes of the Society, and as many more were turned away. Each new member must bring in two more within a week. The speakers of the Society (its organizers were a writer, a salesman, and an attorney) are men of intelligence and ability. They foresee none required to work after 45 years of age, no taxes, no debts, no mortgages, no fear of poverty; new inventions and scientific discoveries to be for the benefit of all. One of the first duties of each Utopian is to write to President Roosevelt, praising the New Deal and imploring the final smashing of the present monetary system. All that the Utopians desire will be here, and much more, when God’s name is vindicated at Armageddon and all the devils, big and little, and those that have the Devil’s‘spirit, will be destroyed by the angels of God.</span></p>

He’s wonderful! It breaks my heart to do this, but I must. I am unable to take care of him. Oh, I love him! God bless him and care for him. From his broken-hearted mother.” Another item is of a wealthy turfman burying his dog in a $400 bronze casket designed for a child (vault and monument $1,000 more), with an item of a baby buried in Potter’s Field because the father, a waiter, had been out of work eight months. A woman is robbed of jewelry worth $200,000, and near by a jobless man committed suicide and asked that his overcoat be given to some poor man who needed it. The estate of Payne Whitney increased in value over $50,000,000 in two years, and a shoemaker in Kansas put a sign in his window offering to give his children away because he was unable to care for them properly. A party was given to a debutante which cost $50,000, and two men fainted from hunger while applying for jobs at the mayor’s office in New York. A prominent banker builds a yacht for $3,000,000, and girl workers in a shirt factory are found getting as little as 25c a day. A mink coat is offered as a bargain at $3,900, and a jobless girl collapses from hunger. A baby of a year old is left a fortune of almost $2,000,000, and a mother in Brooklyn tries to suicide so her babies can have the benefit of the insurance on her life. Is any change needed?

He could see no wisdom in paying farmers not to raise cotton and wheat at a time when there are millions without enough to eat or wear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">of the series of Judge Rutherford’s five-minute Bible studies appears on this page. This is the tenth in the series of eighteen, each of which discusses some outstanding and fundamental doctrine of the Bible. The tendency of many exponents of Scripture to stress relatively unimportant matters and to overlook or neglect the great underlying truths of the Word of God is sedulously avoided. Frequent quotations from the Scriptures themselves, as well as indirect reference to their authority, make these talks a valuable means of more fully acquainting oneself with the letter and spirit of the Bible.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Resurrection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE word “resurrection” moans a &quot;standing up again to life’. If, as claimed by the clergy, the dead are alive in “purgatory” or some other place, then it follows that there could be no resurrection; and yet there is no truth more clearly taught in the Bible than that of the resurrection of the dead. Death means the absence of life, and resurrection means awakening to life again. If the dead are to live again, then they must be resurrected and God has provided that there shall be a resurrection. The basis for the resurrection of the dead is the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. All mankind were born in sin, and the death of the perfect man Jesus provided the purchase price for the right of man to live again, and in due time Jesus will awaken them out of death. Men had been dying for 4,000 years before the death of Jesus, and hence they knew nothing about the value of His death. Men have been dying in ignorance of the value of Jesus’ death for the past 1900 years. All of the dead in God’s due time shall be awakened out of death, that they may obtain a knowledge of the truth, and then each one for himself must choose to obey God and Christ and live, or else continue in sin and be for ever destroyed. Therefore it is written (Acts 24:15): “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has appointed a fixed time for the resurrection of the dead, and that time is during the reign of Christ as King of the world. His reign has now begun, but His first great act is to destroy Satan and his power, and that will be done shortly, at the battle of Armageddon. Then will follow the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection of Christ Jesus is a guarantee that all who have died in ignorance must be awakened out of death and given a knowledge of the truth. For that reason the Scriptural argument, as set forth in 1 Corinthians 15, is this: Tf there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen; and if Christ is risen, that is a guarantee that all the dead shall rise.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact of the resurrection is complete proof that the doctrine of “purgatory”, concerning people’s being in a place of suffering, is entirely false. The Scriptures speak of death as sleep, because man is unconscious when asleep. The dead are asleep in Jesus, for the reason that Jesus has bought the right of man to live. Therefore it is written: “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.” (1 Thessalonians 4:14) The purpose of the awakening men out of death is to give them an opportunity and trial for life; and this will be given at the appearing of Christ Jesus and His kingdom. (2 Timothy 4:1) During the reign of Christ death itself wall be destroyed, in this, that all who then obey His righteous law shall live, and never die, and all the willfully wicked will be completely destroyed. For that reason Jesus said: “And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?”—John 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God in His loving-kindness has provided for the redemption of sinful man from death, through Christ Jesus’ sacrifice, and for the resurrection to life of men who believe and obey. The Devil tries to keep the people in total ignorance of this great truth, and for that reason has caused his representatives on earth to teach false doctrines. What the people must now do is to apply themselves to gain an understanding of the Bible, and to that end must provide themselves with the necessary books to enable them to find the texts in the Bible and learn their meaning. You can do this just as well in your own home as anywhere else. Write The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Watch Tower for a list of these books explaining these truths and you will receive such information free of charge. You owe it to yourself and your family to gain this knowledge. Jehovah’s way is always right and true. Learn that way and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Death has brought untold sorrow to mankind. The resurrection will bring boundless joy to those who obey God under Christ’s kingdom, and concerning which it is written: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” (Revelation 21:4) The faithful Christians will have part in the first resurrection, which means life in the spirit with Christ. The obedient ones on the earth during the reign of Christ will be given everlasting life on the earth in complete happiness.</span></p>

Part of the deficit was caused by payments to farmers to keep them from planting as much as usual. The administration has received some criticisms of the burning of surplus farm products in Iowa at a time when millions of people are in dire need. This winter, same as last, whole trainloads of cotton (255,000 bales) will be worked up into mattresses, quilts, pillow cases, towels and other requirements of the needy.</span></p>

Receiving such assurance that this church did not and would not carry any item for missions in its budget, the company consented to continue negotiations.” Several similar cases are cited, indicating that Big Business is determined to have its money anyway, whether there is anything for missions or not.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Uses of Benedictine Wine</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">illiam Lloyd Clabk tells us that the special use of Benedictine wine, made at the Benedictine Monastery, Fa Comp, France, is to arouse the animal passions. The wine is specially doctored with ingredients for the purpose. It is specially useful in institutions where attractive single women are kept behind bars, subject to visits of celibate men; such women are never permitted to go out singly; they go out in pairs, so that there can be no squealing. On each bottle of Benedictine wine is the papal coat of arms and pope’s tiara. At present the pope is very anxious to clean up American movies. Seems as though, if he really wants to clean up something, nobody should discourage him. Cardinal Dougherty, of Philadelphia, in ordering the boycott of the movies in the diocese of Philadelphia, described them as attacking “the very foundations of our Christian civilization, namely, the sacrament of marriage, the purity of womanhood”. It was in Philadelphia that it required a big squad of policemen to force a group of girls back into a so-called “House of the Good Shepherd”; they fought desperately in a vain effort to escape from the hell hole in which they were confined. Seems as if Cardinal Dougherty could find something to clean up in Philadelphia besides the movies. All films were also boycotted in St. Louis, where the same boycotting outfit crowded Judge Rutherford off KMOX a year ago. When the boycott was put on in Cleveland the presiding archbishop urged Catholic Action to “infuse into society the spiritual life of Christ”. It was in Cleveland that the official Catholic paper, a year ago, managed to call Judge Rutherford some 82 vile names as its contribution on ‘infusing into society the spiritual life of Christ’. Protestant ministers generally are going along with Jezebel’s efforts to doll herself up for the party which is sure to come off when Jehu arrives. In Scranton the police got weary of the attacks made upon them by a prominent Protestant minister, shadowed him, found that he had been for a year and a half a constant visitor to the red light district, and finally caught him in a place and under circumstances that will make it unnecessary for him to preach any more in Scranton. The pope is very much in favor of the drive against the indecent films. It is doubtful if he knows how much of the drug called Spanish fly his monks put in the Benedictine wine. Control of the movies will henceforth be in the hands of the Catholics.</span></p>

In America Catholic prelates are very busy. They have demanded that Will Hays, movie magnate, resign. He is a Presbyterian, and it is thought that a good Catholic should have his job. The rector of St. Andrew’s Roman Catholic church has blessed the wine cellars under Brooklyn bridge. Not sure if these wine cellars had any Benedictine wine in them, but presume they had. The Federal Council of Churches is circulating pledges to remain away from movies which “offend decency and Christian morality”. The Roman Catholic church will decide what is decent and moral. In New York these meetings between Catholics, Protestants and Jews at which word is given out as to what is decent and moral are held in the rectory of the Holy Cross Roman Catholic church. The clergy of the Jewish people are going along with the Catholic program. The pope has just asked the Italian Women's Catholic Action society to stamp out Protestant propaganda in Italy. The invitation to stamp it out in America has not yet come, but is on the way. After they get the movies cleaned up, with the help of the Protestants and Jews, the Catholics will then clean up the Protestants and Jews themselves, so these dispatches from Rome indicate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font5">T NEWARK, N. J., a retail liquor license has been granted to the Holy Name Society of St. Casimir’s Roman Catholic church. As it is against the law to issue a license to a booze joint within 200 feet of a church, and this one will be run as an annex of the church, the Reverend Paul Knappek, who will be interested in the receipts of the saloon, signed a legal waiver of objections to the saloon’s being so close to the images and holy water. As it gets harder and harder to get money out of the flock, Holy Name Society barrooms are bound to become increasingly frequent as annexes to Catholic churches. In the Bronx there was a parade two miles long of Holy Name Societies, against atheism and communism; it took 100 policemen to escort it, and would have taken 200 if the marchers had first visited the St. Casimir Holy Name saloon; so it is probably a good thing that it is in Newark and not in New York.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>The Great Pyramid : of God or of Satan ?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N THE land of Egypt, in the northern part of Africa, there is set up a great structure of stone which is called “the great pyramid of Gizeh”. For the past half-century many students of God’s Word have been taught and have believed that the great pyramid of Egypt is that which God through His prophet refers to in the nineteenth chapter of Isaiah. Many have relied upon that structure of stone to corroborate the testimony concerning what they call the “divine plan” as set forth in the Word of God. In fact, some have designated the pyramid “the Bible in stone” and “God’s stone witness”. If that were true, that would be an admission on God's part that His Word needs corroborative proof and is therefore insufficient in itself. If His Word needs corroborative proof, then the statement of Psalm 119:105, that His Word is the guide for His children, could not be true. If, however, His Word is sufficient as a guide for His children, then corroborative proof for His Word is superfluous. It belittles His written Word to say that it needs such proof. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable . . . that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” —2 Timothy 3:16,17; John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The burden is upon the devotees of the pyramid of Gizeh to show from God’s Word that He had anything whatsoever to do w<sup>7</sup>ith building it. If they make the proof, then they show that the Word of God is insufficient. If they fail to make the proof, then the pyramid should be put out of the mind of everyone who serves God. The facts are, however, that nowhere in God’s Word is the pyramid mentioned either directly or indirectly. Is it not passing strange that if God provided for His church to be taught by the measurements of a pile of stone neither Jesus nor any of the apostles had one word to say about it, but, on the contrary, emphasized the necessity of adhering closely to the Word of truth and unselfishly serving it? If the pyramid is not mentioned in the Bible, then following its teachings is being led by vain philosophy and false science and not following after Christ.— 1 Timothy 6:20; Colossians 2: 8.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark209"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>Location</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">By an ingenious method of drawing lines an effort is made to prove that the great pyramid is located “in the midst of the land of Egypt, and . . . at the border thereof”. (Isaiah 19:19) Many conscientious persons have swallowed this philosophy, bait, hook, sinker, line and all, without stopping to consider. In the first place it is a physical impossibility to place a tangible object in the midst of a certain tract of land and on the border thereof. By referring to the map of Egypt it is easy to be seen that the great pyramid is situated neither in the midst of the land of Egypt nor on the border thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Egypt is approximately 600 miles long from north to south, and 250 miles wide in the broadest part. Ancient Egypt was bounded on the south by Ethiopia, and on the north by the Mediterranean sea. The prophet Ezekiel mentions the city of Syene (Seveneh, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hebrew), </span><span class="font5">which was in the southern part of Egypt, and is nearer Egypt’s border than is the pyramid. (Ezekiel 29:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font5"> 30: 6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> The location of the pyramid of Gizeh is approximately 100 miles south of the Mediterranean sea, and 400 miles north of Seveneh; and, of course, the southern border of Egypt is still farther south than Seveneh. Therefore the location of the pyramid cannot be fitted to the prophecy, even if the prophecy referred to the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark211"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>Altar and Pillar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah 19:19 says: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt.” The claim is made that the altar here mentioned refers to the pyramid of Gizeh. The Hebrew word from which “altar” is here translated means a place of sacrifice. There is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that the pyramid is or ever will be a place of sacrifice. Surely it is not now a place of sacrifice. When the church of God is all complete there will then be no occasion for sacrifice. Their covenant with Jehovah God by sacrifice will be done.— Psalm 50: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Isaiah 19:19 is given a literal interpretation and applied to the land of Egypt, the facts must show that there has been, is now, or shall be in the future, sacrifice performed in Egypt at the pyramid. Not one word in the Bible would justify or support the conclusion that the pyramid is an altar, within the Scriptural meaning. The conclusion must be abandoned that the prophecy refers to the pyramid of Gizeh when it mentions the “altar”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing, the prophecy says: “And a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.” The word “pillar” here used means a memorial column,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">or a pillar of testimony. In support of the correctness of this definition the prophecy further says: “And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts,” Jehovah. Never at any time in the past has the pyramid given testimony to the name of Jehovah; and surely it is not doing so now.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>Shape</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">A pyramid is properly defined as a solid body standing on a triangular, square or polygonal base, and terminating in a point at the top. Such is the shape or form of the pyramid of Gizeh, except that there is no capstone or point at the top. Many men can stand on the top of it now. It has been stated that “the pyramid figure represents perfection and completeness” and symbolically represents the “plan of God” and particularly represents Christ Jesus the Head or topstone of the structure. In support Ephesians 2:19, 20 is quoted: “Now therefore ye . . . are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is quite manifest that the apostle did not have in mind the pyramid of G izeh or any other pyramid when he wrote the above. He is there addressing God’s anointed saints and tells them that they are built upon the foundation of the prophets and apostles, Jesus himself being the chief corner stone. Then he adds: “In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.” (Ephesians 2:21,22) Again, he says: “Ye are God’s building.” (1 Corinthians 3:9) And: “Ye are the temple of the living God.”—2 Corinthians 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Clearly, in these scriptures the apostle had in mind the temple built by Solomon, which symbolically represents The Christ, both the Head thereof and the body. He could not have had in mind a pyramid. Solomon’s temple was not in the shape of a pyramid. God’s kingdom organization is described in Revelation 21:10-16, not as in the form of a pyramid, but as a great cube. Neither a pyramid nor any building of the shape of a pyramid is anywhere mentioned in the Scriptures. The facts show that Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone of God’s “new creation”, the church; but that fact is no evidence that the pyramid or its topstone represents Christ, even if it had a topstone.—2 Corinthians 5:17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">R.V., </span><span class="font5">margin; Ephesians 2:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures describe the house of God as His temple, Christ Jesus as the Chief One in that house and as the Head of it, and the other members thereof are likened unto “living stones” built into that “house”. (1 Peter 2:4-10) The pyramid is not a house.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>Who Built It?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Certainly not Jehovah; nor was it built at His command. Yet to try to prove that the pyramid is “God’s building” Job 38: 4-6 has been quoted: “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding? Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line upon it ? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof?” But surely God w<sup>r</sup>as not magnifying the importance of a pile of stone when He gave utterance to these words! It is so manifest that He referred to laying the foundations of the earth that there can be no doubt about it. Then He tells of another great thing that took place at that time: “The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.&quot; (Job 38:7) All these things occurred centuries before the creation of man, and many more centuries before the pyramid was built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Egyptian labor was used to construct the great pyramid, that of itself is conclusive proof that God had nothing to do with its building. It is said that the pyramid of Gizeh contains stones the estimated weight of which is eighty tons. Some of these stones are thirty feet in length. There is evidence that the stones were taken from a quarry on the east side of the river Nile and were dragged over to the site of the pyramid. If that work was done by human hands or human power, then it must have been done by men who were slaves. That being true, without a doubt many of them died from exhaustion or from being cruelly driven to the task. If there was any sacrifice about that pyramid, it was the sacrifice of slaves to build it. Jehovah God does not accomplish any of His work in that way. The great God of justice and love would not erect a structure which would result in the oppression of slaves and great loss of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is more reasonable to conclude that the great pyramid, as well as the other pyramids thereabout, also the sphinx, were built by the rulers of Egypt and under the direction of Satan the Devil, whom such rulers served. The rulers of Egypt have been known for their oppression of slaves. The Devil is the great oppressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the sons of Noah that came out of the ark with him Jehovah God chose Shem and blessed him. Abraham the Hebrew was a descendant of Shem. Satan the Devil chose Ham, another son of Noah. Egypt is known as the land of Ham. (Psalm 105: 23) The Devil, by the use of Ham’s descendants, set up Egypt as the first great world power. Then Satan, the erstwhile holy cherub named Lucifer, put his knowledge in dead stone, which may be called “Satan’s Bible”, and not God’s stone witness. In erecting the pyramid, of course, Satan would put in it some truth, because that is his method of practicing fraud and deceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The information which Lucifer, one of the “morning stars” (Job 38: 7; Isaiah 14:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font5"> gained at the laying of the foundations of the earth doubtless included much concerning its measurements and God’s unit of measurements ; and by applying such knowledge Lucifer, now Satan, could put much in the pyramid that would harmonize with truth and which would serve to deceive men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah 31:1 says: “Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help.” Whether this text be given a literal or a symbolic meaning, it is a warning to spiritual Israelites, God’s “new creation”. If applied literally, it means that the new creatures in Christ have gone down to literal Egypt to find proof to corroborate God’s so-called “plan”; which course is wrong. If applied symbolically, it means that new creatures have gone down to the world for help; they take such corroborative proof of worldly wisdom expressed in stone. Worldly wisdom proceeds not from God, but from the Devil. (1 Corinthians 3:19) The correct interpretation of Isaiah 31:1 is undoubtedly that the Christian should not seek wisdom from the world or from anything that is in the world, but should always look unto Jehovah, who speaks to His children through His Word. The Devil’s purpose at all times is to turn the mind of man away from God’s Word.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>The Prophecy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah, chapter nineteen, here considered, opens with the statement: “The burden of Egypt.” It does not relate to literal Egypt, of course. Symbolically Egypt always represents Satan’s organization or world. Pharaoh, the king or ruler of Egypt, is symbolical of the Devil himself. Note Ezekiel 29: 3 on this point: “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers [peoples], which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” Satan the Devil claims the world as his, and all the people and nations (represented by the “rivers”) as his. He made this claim to Jesus, and Jesus did not dispute it. (Matthew 4:8-11) “The whole world lies under the evil one.” (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott) </span><span class="font5">No one will with Scripture successfully dispute the fact that Egypt symbolically represents the world, Satan’s organization. God Jehovah is against Satan's organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah’s prophecy continues: “Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud [not literal, of course, but a symbol of His unseen presence and betokening a fast-approaching storm], and shall come into Egypt.” Clearly this means the Lord’s taking action against the Devil’s organization, “the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Egypt,</span><span class="font5"> where also our Lord was crucified.” (Revelation 11:8) Thus the meaning of the word “Egypt” and the time of the prophecy's fulfilment are definitely fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah’s prophecy says further: “And the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his [the Lord’s] presence [symbolized by the cloud], and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.” Since 1918 and the close of the great World War that year the ecclesiastical organization of earth has adopted the League of Nations as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. The League organization, including the clergy and the principal ones of their church flocks, and the politicians and the profiteers, have been and are now in trouble. As Jesus foretold: ‘Men’s hearts are failing them for fear.’ (Luke 21: 25-27) The visible (earthly) part of Satan’s organization, while trying to direct the affairs of men and governments to keep the people in control, is suffering from a stroke of heart disease, and complete heart failure may soon follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah 19 further says: “And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.” The present conditions and that which is clearly portended by present events help to locate the time of fulfilment of this part of the prophecy as at the oncoming battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophecy further says (verse 11): “Surely the princes of Zoan [Satan’s counselors] are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh [the Devil] is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1”</span><span class="font5"> The time when these counselors are fools because of disregarding Jehovah God and even denying Him and His purposes is indicated by the further words of the prophecy: “Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.” The time is now! Everyone who knows God’s truth can surely see that “Christendom’s” advisers and counselors are fools. They refuse to acknowledge even the name of Jehovah as the great God, and scorn and maltreat Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, verse 16: “In that day shall Egypt be like unto women; and it shall be afraid and fear, because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shaketh over it.” Jehovah is now brandishing His “Arm” (Christ Jesus) over the nations composing Satan’s visible organization, and this brings great fright to them, just as Jesus foretold: “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear.” (Luke 21: 25, 26) And now the clergy in particular are like “women”, the weaker sex, and refuse to come out in the open and fight for what they believe. They content themselves by saying to their parishioners : ‘Believe what you please, just so you stick to us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Judah” in prophecy means those who give praise to the name of Jehovah God. (Genesis 29: 35) Says verse 17: “And the land of Judah [not literal, of course, but meaning Jehovah’s witnesses under Christ, the Lion of Judah] shall be a terror unto Egypt: every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath determined against it.” Jehovah’s faithful witnesses go forth telling the people the truth, and the truth causes the representatives of Satan’s organization great pain. It strikes terror into their hearts (Ezekiel 30:9), and hence they try to keep it off the radio and to prevent it from being distributed in print from house to house by Jehovah’s witnesses. The next verse of the prophecy, Isaiah 19:18, refers to the same class, in the world (“the land of Egypt”) but speaking the speech of God’s land of promise and swearing in consecration of themselves to Jehovah of hosts. This class, God’s remnant, tell the people of the world concerning God’s determination to bring destruction on Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark219"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>The Altar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Verse 19 (which many have believed refers to the pyramid of Gizeh): “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.” The word “altar”, meaning a slaughterplace, or place of sacrifice, refers to those who are in relationship to God by reason of the covenant by sacrifice with Him.—Psalm 50: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period of sacrifice, extending from Christ’s baptism and down to the setting up of His kingdom, many consecrating to God have been taken into the “covenant with me [Jehovah] by sacrifice”. (Psalm 50: 5) As one of such Paul says: “We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” (Romans 8:36) Concerning the faithful class who have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice Jesus said: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:14) Otherwise stated, such are “in the midst of the land of Egypt” (the world) but not a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are now “in that day”, and the faithful remnant of God is the altar class “to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt” (the world). That altar is not a pile of dead stone built up by oppressors long ago in the literal land of Egypt; but the altar represents God’s anointed witnesses now on earth. They are now in the world but are no part of the world, the Devil’s organization. These are daily offering up in righteousness their sacrifice of praise and devotion unto God, and by so doing are bearing the reproaches of Christ. (Malachi 3:3; Hebrews 13:13,15) These are God’s messengers, entrusted with the obligation of telling His message to the people. (Compare the symbolic language of Revelation 8: 3,5.)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark221"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>Pillar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The word “pillar” in the prophecy means a memorial column that stands forth as a witness giving testimony. “In that day shall there be . . . a pillar at the border thereof [of Egypt].” The faithful remnant today of Jehovah’s witnesses compose the “feet of him”, or the last members of the “body of Christ” now on earth (Isaiah 52:7); they are on the very border-line between the Devil’s kingdom and the kingdom of God. The time of transition from one to the other is here. They have journeyed down to the time when they are about to pass over the border out from the world and into the glorious kingdom of Jehovah. It is now easy to be seen how God’s remnant on earth can be truly said to be ‘an altar in the midst of Egypt (the world) and a pillar at the border thereof unto the Lord’. As an altar they are offering their sacrifice; as a pillar they are bearing witness for the Lord Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to fit the literal pyramid of Gizeh to the prophet’s description; but the position and condition of the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses exactly fit the prophetic description, which is therefore right. Another thing suggesting the time of fulfilment of that prophecy is what Jesus spoke to the “church in Philadelphia”, now applying: “Him that overcometh will I make a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pillar</span><span class="font5"> in the temple of my God.” (Revelation 3:12) As long as such a one is of God's remnant and remains faithful he shall be a pillar in the spiritual temple of God bearing testimony; and thus it is written: “In his temple doth every one speak of his [Jehovah’s] glory.” —Psalm 29:9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark223"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>Sign and Witness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing the prophecy says (verse 20): “And it [the altar-pillar] shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord [Jehovah] of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.” The pyramid of Gizeh is neither a sign nor a witness unto the Lord of hosts to show that the battle of Armageddon is the battle of Jehovah of hosts against Satan’s organization and that we are approaching that great battle of God Almighty. That which is “for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt” is now that faithful company of the followers of Christ which is called “Jehovah’s witnesses”. These are the ones that make up a little company that are doing what they can to exalt the name of Jehovah. The prophet Isaiah said that he and his sons were set for signs and wonders in the world, saying: “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in Zion.” According to Hebrews 2:13 Isaiah and his sons foreshadowed God’s remnant of witnesses under Christ Jesus. (See also Jeremiah 32:20 and Zechariah 3:8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God challenges Satan’s representatives to make proof of their claims or else to admit God’s truth. Then to His remnant Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord [Jehovah], that I am God.” (Isaiah 43:10,12) Such are the only ones on earth that stand as a sign and pillar and a witness unto Jehovah of hosts. They are witnessing of Him and His name and concerning His kingdom and the expression of His vengeance at Armageddon, which is just ahead. Jehovah’s witnesses are putting forth their best endeavors to obey the command of the Lord by telling the good news to all the nations for a witness.—Matthew 24:14; Isaiah 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophecy says their witness is given at the time the people are crying unto the Lord because of oppression; “for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.” Throughout the entire visible part of Satan’s world today the cries of the people are heard against those who rule over them and who continue to oppress them. It is the condition just preceding the great and terrible expression of God’s wrath against Satan’s organization. Then follows the battle of Armageddon, which will bring deliverance to the people; and the knowledge of the great Savior, Jehovah, by His Vindicator, Christ Jesus, will bring them relief and everlasting blessings. “And,” continues the prophecy (verses 21, 22), “the Lord [Jehovah] shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians [the people once under Satan’s organization] shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. And the Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it [the people, not Satan’s organization]: and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them.” Then will Jehovah spread to the people a “feast of fat things” (Isaiah 25: 6), and blindness shall be removed from their eyes, and Jehovah’s name then vindicated will be glorious throughout earth and heaven.</span></p>

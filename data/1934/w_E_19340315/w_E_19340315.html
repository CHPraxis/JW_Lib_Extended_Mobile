<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of tho world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Lente, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and tho Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceedi&quot;g to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of tho peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that tho Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy name, 0 Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, 0 Lord, throughout all generations.”—Ps. 133: 1.3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S primary purpose in sending Moses to Egypt was to place before the Egyptian ruling class, and before the people, the proof that he is the Supreme One. His primary purpose in sending Jesus, the antitypical Moses, to earth at both his first and his second coming is to place before the creation of the world the proof that Jehovah is the Almighty, and that there is none besides him. This he does for his own name’s sake, that all may know that life and attending blessings come from God, and from him only. This conclusion is proved by his words to Moses that “the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah’’. (Ex. 7:5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.h’.V.)</span><span class="font3"> It is also proved by the words of Jesus: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’’ (John 17:3) Moses was Jehovah’s instrument in Egypt to place the evidence before the people. Jesus Christ is his instrument or “hand’’ by which Jehovah places the evidence before the entire world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Since the divine purpose is to bring knowledge home to creatures, looking to the vindication of his holy name, and this he did in Egypt by means of plagues, so we now sec that the antitypical plagues in fulfilment of the type consist of some definitely provided means of bringing before the peoples of the world knowledge that Jehovah is God, that his kingdom is here, and that his time is at hand when the oppressive power must vacate and the people be delivered ; hence Satan must let them go or suffer complete destruction. All of this Jehovah does for his own name’s sake; hence what came to pass in Egypt was and is a memorial to Jehovah’s name. What is done in the earth by Christ and his faithful remnant is a memorial to the name of Jehovah God. The plagues upon Egypt culminated in the slaying of the passover lamb, which foreshadowed the death of Christ Jesus; and his faithful followers since his death, by celebrating the Memorial feast, do thereby show forth the death of our Lord, who is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name. The ten plagues were immediately followed by the destruction of Pharaoh’s army, which foreshadows that immediately following the antitypical fulfilment of the plagues there must come the destruction of Satan’s organization at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In considering the antitypical fulfilment of the plagues, therefore, we must not liken Jehovah’s witnesses to frogs or to any other beastly creatures which bring woe upon humankind. The frogs came as a plague upon Egypt after the exercise of divine power and authority by Moses and Aaron. The evils or burdensome troubles upon antitypical Egypt come by reason of the divinely provided message proclaimed, which message of truth brings knowledge home to the creatures of Satan’s organization, and which knowledge is a woe and burden to those of that organization. The redemption and deliverance of the Israelites from the oppression of Egypt was merely incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Likewise the redemp-t'cr’ and deliverance of the human race, and particularly the deliverance of the church, are things incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Such •gdemption and deliverance are, however, proof that Jehovah has the right of the great question at issue. In considering the antitypical fulfilment of the plagues upon Egypt it clearly appears that we. must at all times keep before the mind that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the chief thing, in order that we may have an appreciation of the truth concerning the same. By bringing these plagues upon Egypt before the destruction of the firstborn and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army Jehovah furnished ample opportunity for Pharaoh to yield to his demands and let his people go or to harden his heart and suffer destruction. Even so in connection with the antitypical fulfilment of those plagues Jehovah gives notice and warning to Satan’s organization and affords ample opportunity for Satan and his agents to either willingly bow to Jehovah’s will or else suffer complete destruction. Further examination of these plagues proceeds.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE THREE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The third plague upon Egypt was one of lice. “And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 8:16,17) Lice are associated with filth and are found on creatures of unclean habits. The root of the word rendered “lice” means ‘‘to nip”; hence the lice here mentioned were nippers which would greatly annoy and plague the Egyptians or anyone else whom they might bite. It was the order to Moses to direct Aaron to stretch out his rod and smite the dust of the land, thereby showing that it is divine power and authority conferred upon Christ and by him put upon the remnant of earth to cause the. coming of these antitypical nippers upon the world, which forms Satan’s organization. The lice symbolically stand for or represent that which results from the message of truth delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses and which greatly annoys, plagues and nips or bites the unclean organization of Satan, and particularly the official members thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The visible part of Satan’s organization, particularly that called ‘‘Christendom”, is an unclean and abominable thing and a good habitation for lice. It hypocritically claims to be on the side of the Lord, whereas it is a part of Satan’s wicked organization. Herod Agrippa the First, who killed James and imprisoned Peter, posed as the representative of God but was the instrument of Satan. It is said that he died of a loathsome or lousy disease. ‘ ‘ And upon a set day, Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms [lice), and gave up the ghost.”— Acts 12:21-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Aaron used the rod of Moses to smite the ‘‘dust of the earth”. That dust was symbolic of the earthly, human, visible part of Satan’s organization, and particularly ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, because that part is hypocritical in the superlative degree. The antitypical mouthpiece of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, and which is God’s remnant on the earth acting by authority conferred upon them by Jesus Christ, bear and give forth his message that smites ‘‘Christendom” and declares it to be not of God nor of Christ, but that it is unclean, filthy, and abominable in the sight of God and is exceedingly lousy with Satan’s agents who are nippers of the flesh and suckers of the lifeblood of the people. These lice bring upon the people great suffering, sorrow and death. The message of truth thus delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses to the visible organization of Satan declaring that organization to be lousy greatly offends ‘‘Christendom's” respectability and plagues and annoys that organization. Thus Jehovah’s witnesses are used by him to bring a plague upon Satan's organization by exposing the duplicity and hypocrisy of the chief visible operators therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> It was in 1921 that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> by the Lord's grace, began to call attention to the visible part of Satan’s organization and that it is made up of commercial, political and religious elements which exercise a beastly rule over the people, and is exceedingly filthy. From that time forward Jehovah’s witnesses have been continuously and consistently heralding this message before the people and exposing the hypocritical duplicity and lousy state of ‘‘Christendom” in particular and Satan’s organization in general. By completely separating themselves from ‘‘Christendom” and refusing to have any part or anything in common therewith, or to touch the unclean, lousy, crawling thing, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses add force to this plaguing message. The third plague came upon the ancient Israelites as well as upon the Egyptians; which means that in order for a professed Christian to be pleasing and acceptable to the Lord such must be separate from the world and clean; hence the cleansing of God’s sanctuary is involved and includes the removing of the ‘‘elective elders” as parasites, and which must take place before God’s organization is entirely clean. ‘‘Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52:11) “Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.” (2 Cor. 6:17,18) This divinely provided message widely proclaimed throughout “Christendom” has been to that devilish organization like nipping lice, greatly plaguing and annoying particularly the clergy and the principal ones of their flocks, including, of course, the commercial and political chief men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Pharaoh’s agents (Jannes and Jambrcs), the class opposing God, were unable to'produce lice and had to admit to their chief, Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” (Ex. 8:19) The modern opposers see themselves as unclean and that those devoted to Jehovah are clean and nothing can be found against them except their devotion to Jehovah. By separating themselves from “Christendom” and devoting themselves entirely to the Lord, the remnant are pictured as the dust of God’s organization, meaning the earthly part thereof and which in God’s due time is cleansed. (Dan. 8:14) Jehovah has mercy upon Zion, that is, the visible members of his organization, and favors them by cleansing them; and his servants take pleasure in the faithful members of his organization. “Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.” (Ps. 102:13,14) This dust of the earth is not lousy, but clean, by the grace of the Lord God. Jehovah declares that the unclean organization of Satan shall die like a louse. “Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Hebrew,</span><span class="font3"> like a louse] : but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.” (Isa. 51:6) The plague is still upon Satan’s organization, and he and his agents continue to harden their hearts.—Ex. 8:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE FOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• It is noteworthy that the Israelites were, beginning with the fourth plague, spared and that the seven last plagues were only upon the Egyptians. This would indicate a complete separation of Jehovah’s faithful remnant from the world. The fourth plague was that of a great swarm of flies </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(margin,</span><span class="font3"> a mixture of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">noisome beasts)</span><span class="font3"> that came upon the Egyptians. (Ex. 8:21) In order that God’s chosen people might be assured that Jehovah was with them, and that his enemies might know that Jehovah is God and favors those who love and serve him, Jehovah said to Hoses: “And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people and thy people; to morrow shall this sign be.” (Ex. 8: 22, 23) Moses then served upon Pharaoh another notice of warning demanding that he should release God’s chosen people and pennit them to go and worship him. “And the Lord did so: and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt; the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.” (Ex. 8:24) “He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them.”—Ps. 78:45; 105:31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Just what composed the flies that came upon the Egyptians is not certain, since the word “flics” appearing in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> is a substituted word, as appears from the text. The word “swarm” in the text is from the Hebrew meaning “to intermingle, to traffic with, to give security as a kind of exchange”. The expression well applies to swarms of flics which mix with one another in great numbers, especially in the cast and near east, and are a great pest to the people. ‘Dead flics [ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hebreiu,</span><span class="font3"> zebub] cause the ointment to send forth a vile odor.’ (Ecel. 10:1) The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">zebub</span><span class="font3"> is derived from the Hebrew root meaning “to flit”. “Baakchnb,” according to the Scriptures, means “lord of the flitting one; the side-stepper; the great transgressor”, that is, Satan himself, and which term would apply to all who willingly act according to Satan’s will. The whole world, or antityp-ieal Egypt, lies under Satan the wicked one. (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> The world has been terribly pestered by these flies, that is to say, Satan and his numerous invisible and visible agents, since the coming of the Lord to the temple in 1918.—Rev. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ appearing at the temple in 1918 gathered unto himself the faithful and has anointed them and sent them forth with his message of truth to be given as a testimony, and which message has been and is a great pest to Satan’s organization on earth. That message has declared and continues to declare, particularly unto “Christendom”, the truth of and concerning what constitutes the “higher powers”. Prior thereto, the people, including the followers of Christ, understood and believed that the “higher powers” mentioned in the Scriptures are made up of the visible rulers of this world. The Lord has enlightened his people, and by his grace they now clearly see and declare to the world that “the higher powers” means Jehovah and Christ Jesus and that the world is serving the Devil, and that the big business, political and religious elements, jointly, rule and demand obedience from the people, and these are not of the “higher powers” but are in fact the agents of Satan and the opposers of Jehovah God. IIis witnesses further declare that Jehovah is in no wise responsible for the woes that have come upon the peoples of earth in these last days, but that Satan and his agents arc the ones who have brought these woes and troubles upon the people, and that all mankind holding on to Satan’s organization arc alllicted by the bites, corruption, annoyance and all the schemes and blood-sucking doctrines of the wicked rulers of this world, including Satan himself. Jehovah’s witnesses now declare these truths, and this message exposing Satan and his organization galls and bites and plagues the chief rulers and their allies and supporters. Jehovah’s faithful remnant serve the true “higher powers”, God and Christ Jesus, and refuse to obey any part of Satan’s organization. In obedience to God’s commandments Jehovah’s witnesses go about the country preaching the gospel of his kingdom, which message is of great annoyance to Satan’s crowd and which message bites them and plagues them like numerous flies. The rulers in “Christendom” claim to be representatives of God, and if they were honest they would welcome Jehovah’s witnesses; but, instead, they side-step the questions that arc presented to them by the Lord’s witnesses and declare Jehovah’s witnesses to be peddlers and hawkers and not preachers of the gospel. The rulers of this wicked world claim that they have no objection to anyone’s worshiping God according to their own ideas, but denounce Jehovah’s witnesses and evade the real issue by declaring them to be engaged in a commercial enterprise instead of teaching the gospel. The truth plagues them so thoroughly that they must make some apparent plausible objection thereto.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The flies so greatly annoyed the Egyptians that “Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land”. (Ex. 8: 25) Otherwise stated, Pharaoh was willing that the Israelites might do some worshiping, but they must do it according to the Egyptians’ ideas and in the presence of the Egyptians. Now’ the antitypical Egyptians, the representatives of Satan on earth, say to Jehovah’s witnesses, in substance, ‘We have no objection to your worshiping your God, but do it in the church buildings (“cur land”), as others do, and refrain from interfering with our commercial business or annoying our people by going from house to house. ’ Moses told Pharaoh that for Israelites to sacrifice before the Egyptians would be an abomination to God. Likewise Jehovah’s remnant today reply to the modern Egyptians: “We must obey God and not man; we will follow his commandments and obey the higher powers.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> in June 1929, set forth for the first time the truth of and concerning the “higher powers”, and then the flies began to bite Satan’s crowd because the truth exposed that wicked organization. As Jehovah separated the land of Goshen, where the Israelites dwelt, from the Egyptians, so God cleans his people and separates them from Satan’s organization, showing them the truth as to who constitute the higher powers. Jehovah declared: “And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flics shall be there; to the end thou inayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.” (Ex. 8:22) When that plague came upon the Egyptians there were no swarms of flies on the Israelites, God’s people. Even so now Jehovah cleanses his own people, whom he uses as his witnesses, and there arc no flies on them. They are in the world, but not of it. They continue to declare the message of truth, and, as Pharaoh and his house hardened their hearts, even so now those of “Christendom” continue to harden their hearts and more testimony is required.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE FIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Pharaoh continued his obstinacy and hypocrisy, and Moses warned him that the hand of Jehovah would be upon all of his cattle in Egypt. “Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.” (Ex. 9:3) The Lord specifically declared that this plague should not affect the Israelites, and then God appointed a set time for the coming of this plague upon Egypt saying: “To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land. And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. ” (Ex. 9:4-7) Before any of the plagues began to come upon the Egyptians Moses declared before Pharaoh that Jehovah would fall upon the Israelites with pestilence if they failed to sacrifice unto the Lord. (Ex. 5:3) Because of the faithfulness of Moses and Aaron in giving the testimony God spared the Israelites from the pestilence. ‘Obedience is better than sacrifice.’ The Lord spared the Israelites from these pestilences that now were coming upon the Egyptians.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>M</sup> The plague of grievous murrain was upon all the beasts of the Egyptians. The beasts of burden of the Egyptians, to wit, horses, asses, camels, oxen and that sort, represented the live wealth of the Egyptians in carrying on its commerce and war and all such live stock and equipment so used by the Egyptians in exercising their selfish purpose and opposition against Jehovah God’s kingdom. The plague of “murrain” or pestilence on the beasts of Egypt was a further notice and warning to the Egyptians and which foreshadowed a message of truth to be declared by the power and authority of Jehovah God by and through the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, and in which the faithful remnant are used; and which message is to the effect, to wit, that this world’s ‘beasts of burden’, including all military and economic organizations, human inventions, and all kinds of national recovery schemes, and such things as “holy year” schemes, are all fraudulent and are not from Jehovah God, and are not due to the fact that Christ is ‘preparing the way of Jehovah’; but that all such things arc of the Devil and will completely fail to bring relief to the people, and that all must die. This message Jehovah’s witnesses began to declare emphatically after the coming of the Lord to the temple, and which message is set forth in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 165 and pages following. The Word of God declares that a great plague shall come upon Satan’s organization, and all of his instruments, represented by his cattle, shall die. This message of truth that their beasts of burden, their implements and other means of carrying on their commercial and fraudulent schemes must perish, is a great plague to “Christendom” and greatly annoys Satan and his visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The Lord’s Word then declares that ‘not one of the cattle of the Israelites died’, which foreshadowed that the means of activities, or “the beasts of burden”, employed by the faithful remnant are wholly devoted to the Lord, and, being thus devoted to the Lord, he, of course, protects them. They separate themselves from the world and from their sacrifice unto God. (See Ex. 10:26; Zech. 14:20; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> page 335.) That message declaring that vengeance shall come upon Satan’s organization because of his opposition to God is now being delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses and continues to plague the enemy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE SIX</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The “botch of Egypt” was the sixth plague. The furnaces, limekilns and brickkilns of Egypt constituted a part of its economic or commercial industry, and hence pictured the things now pertaining to the commercial industry of the visible part of the world, which is Satan’s organization. (Isa. 33:12) Jehovah then directed Moses and Aaron to take these ashes from the furnaces and for Moses to sprinkle the same before Pharaoh. “And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 9: 8, 9) This resulted in breaking forth of boils with blains. According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">llotherham</span><span class="font3"> rendering of the text blains are ‘burning sores, breaking out in pustules’. Such plague came upon man and beast throughout Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The sixth plague pictured a further message of Christ and his faithful remnant, his representatives on earth, which message is delivered by the power and authority of Jehovah God. The clue to the significance of this plague appears to be given in Revelation 16:2,11. This shows that the plague would affect all those who are members of Satan’s organization on earth as the leaders thereof, as well as those who are supporters of that wicked organization.—For explanation see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 20 and pages following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> Pharaoh concluded that with all of his equipment and power to rule he could defy Jehovah and get away with it. Even so Satan and his earthly agents have concluded that they can weld together and unite the nations and the peoples of earth into a confederacy or league and thus defy Jehovah God by setting up their own organization and thus rule and control the world continuously. (Isa. 8:9-13) But all such schemes of the worldly organization must fail. Jehovah causes his faithful remnant on earth, his witnesses, to proclaim before the Devil and all of his agents in tho world, which constitute modem Egypt, that the League of Nations, the World Court, the peace pacts, disarmament conferences, “holy year” schemes, prosperity schemes, and ail such like schemes, arc not of God, but of the Devil, and that the instigators and supporters thereof are unclean and an abomination in the sight of God, just as Uzziah was unclean and became leprous for his wrongful acts before Jehovah. (2 Chron. 26:13-23) The declaration of this message of truth beginning with the ‘pouring out of the first vial’, as described in Revelation, continues upon the world; and such declaration of truth throughout the realms of ‘‘Christendom” by means of radio, books, magazines, and word-of-mouth testimony has been and is a great plague to the modern Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians blasphemed God’s name because of the suffering from their pains and sores, and likewise the modern Egyptians, Satan’s earthly agents, do blaspheme and curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> This plague of putrid boils afflicted the magicians as well as the others of Egypt. ‘‘And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.” (Ex. 9:11) Those magicians could not stand before Hoses to resist him; likewise the modern magicians, “Jannes and Jambres,” because of their corruption attempt to resist the message of God through Christ, but they cannot successfully do so, and their end is in sight and their fall shall appear before all men who survive. (2 Tim. 3:8) The clergy and the “man of sin” and all like modern “wonder”-workers, and “holy year” workers of modern Egypt, now itch and scratch and are tormented, and thus mark themselves badly, and they continue to howl and express their agony, opposition to and indignation against the message of truth that is plainly placed before them, and thus are guilty of the ‘transgression that maketh desolate’. (Dan. 8:13) Jehovah’s witnesses are divinely permitted to proclaim the message of truth which thus plagues the opposers of the Most High. Instead of these opposers’ giving heed thereto, they harden their hearts against the Lord, and further plagues come upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE SEVEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The seventh plague was a rain of grievous hail such as never before was known. “Seven” is a symbol of divine completeness, while hail symbolizes hard and unbreakable truths that cut, bruise and kill. All the plagues, antitypieally, have to do with the proclamation of God’s message of truth, and this proclamation of truth or work of Jehovah’s witnesses will not be completed on earth until they have proclaimed all of Jehovah’s warning messages of vengeance and vindication; and this they must do before Armageddon. Jehovah might well have completely smitten Egypt when Pharaoh first refused to let the Israelites go, but it pleased God to cause further testimony to be delivered to Pharaoh and his royal house. Even so Jehovah might well have smitten Satan’s earthly organization when first Christ came to the temple, but it pleased him to permit Satan to go on and to remain for a time, that further witness might be given, and that Jehovah's power might be made more manifest, and that none of the world should have any reason to say that they were taken unawares by the judgments of Jehovah. Six plagues had now been upon Egypt, and this had served only to harden the heart of Pharaoh. The purpose of the plagues upon Egypt was to place plainly before the Egyptians the name and supremacy of Jehovah. Instead of God’s completely destroying Pharaoh and his organization earlier, he said: “For at this time I send all my plagues </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> all my remaining plagues] against thy heart, and against thy servants, -and against thy people; in order that thou ma jest know that there is none like me on all the earth. For even now I might have stretched out my hand, and I might have smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence; and thou wouldst have been cut off from the earth; but for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:14-16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lecser)</span><span class="font3"> The remaining plagues that were to come upon Egypt and which did come were further notice and warning to Satan’s earthly organization. This notice of warning in modern times must be given and declared by Jehovah’s witnesses as members of his temple organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2t</sup> A great storm or downpour of hail accompanied by the fire of lightning smote the crops and men and beasts of Egypt. Jehovah had warned Pharaoh, but that warning was unheeded; and now he sent forth upon the Egyptians the seventh plague. “And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smole every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.” (Ex. 9: 23-25) That great plague of hail came upon Egypt in the springtime, and which is shown by the words of verse thirty-one: “And the flax and the barley was smitten; for the barley was in the car, and the flax was boiled.” “He smote their vines also, and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.” (Ps. 105:33) Antitypically this plague began to come upon Satan’s earthly organization in August 1928. It was then that Jehovah caused his people on earth, to whom had been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, to declare his message against Satan and his organization. The proclamation of a specific message was there begun, and carried on through the earth, which message is designated “Declaration against Satan and for Jehovah”. This was first publicly declared at an assembly of Jehovah’s people in Detroit, Michigan. It was then that the lightnings flashed from the temple and the remnant had their first clear vision of the great issue joined between Satan and Jehovah. (Sec </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">September 15, 1928; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 221.) Since that time in particular God has continued to rain down upon “Christendom” great chunks of strong and weighty truths, unparalleled in the history of the world, and this because the time has arrived for the ‘increase of knowledge’, and for the announcement to be made that the end of Satan’s organization is at hand. (Dan. 12:4; Rev. 11:17) It is the day of Jehovah God, the day of his vengeance and vindication, and his message of vengeance therefore must be declared. That great hailstorm has continued to spoil “Christendom’s” self-righteousness (pictured by the linen flax in Egypt, which was destroyed) and “Christendom’s” spiritual fodder (first fruits, pictured by the barley destroyed in Egypt) and her self-conscious sweetness (pictured by the fig trees and their fruit in Egypt, which were spoiled). Satan’s lies, which had found refuge in “Christendom”, there began to be swept away, and are being swept away, by thfi flood of truth. (Isa. 28:2-17) Therefore Jehovah is causing his witnesses on earth to bear his message of truth throughout the world to modern Egypt, calling attention to his own supreme power and that this power will be completely made manifest at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> In Pharaoh’s realm in Egypt there were some who heard and gave heed to the warning given by Moses concerning the approaching storm; while others failed and refused to give any heed thereto, and they suffered as a result thereof. “He that feared the word of the Lord, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses; and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servantsand his cattle in the field.” (Ex. 9: 20, 21) Even so now some persons who are of the world are hearing the word of warning given by authority and power of the Lord in which his witnesses are used, and some of these seek refuge, while others disregard and scoff at the message. The great storm comes upon all of Egypt except Goshen; and likewise this great storm comes upon all the world except God’s chosen people. “Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.” (Ex. 9:26) Among God’s faithful people now on earth the truth, accompanied by flashes of lightning, brings great joy to the hearts of all such; hence there is no plague or hail for any of them. They dwell in the secret and protected place of the Most High and rejoice in the blessings that the Lord gives to them, even as he had long ago promised: “And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places, when it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.” (Isa. 32:18,19) But the poor old “Jannes and Jam-bres” crowd are having a very grievous time. The hail and lightning blinds, bruises, plagues and torments them, and they continue to harden their hearts. More testimony is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE EIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” Had Pharaoh yielded to the demands of the Lord through Moses and let the Israelites go and worship Jehovah, such would have been a public acknowledgment by Pharaoh that he was wrong; and hence his pride would not permit him to do so. So now, if Satan’s earthly agents should give heed to the message of Jehovah delivered through his witnesses, such would be an acknowledgment that these faithful witnesses are telling the truth; and that would be a public admission on the part of Satan and his earthly agents in “Christendom” that the Devil and all of his organization are entirely wrong. It seems, however, that some persons in the Devil’s organization would be glad to give up the fight, because the truth is too much of a plague to them. Satan, however, has “Christendom” tightly tied, and his organization and all the members thereof continue to harden themselves against God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The eighth plague was that of a great swarm of locusts; but, as heretofore stated, the antitypical fulfilments of the plagues do not seem to follow in time order of the other plagues mentioned. The key to the understanding of this plague appears in Revelation 9:1-12, concerning the locusts that came upon the world, an explanation of which is found in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">Book One, pages 136-155. The locusts’ coming from the east, that being the same direction from which come the “kings of the east”, gives a clue to what constitutes this antitypical plague. “And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brougiit an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was mornin g, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they, before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.” (Ex. 10:13,14) “He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillar's, and that without number, and did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. ’ ’—Ps. 105: 34, 35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> In the past few years the constant barrage of testimony of truth at and against “Christendom” has brought a great plague upon Satan’s visible organization. Among these shots thus fired may be counted the message contained in the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis, Escape to the Kingdom, and Dividing the People.</span><span class="font3"> The first organized mass attack of these locusts was made upon the community of Bergenfield, N. J., May 22, 1932, and the work of these witnesses of Jehovah has increased and prospered from that time forward, and this by the grace of the Lord. Even though there is some indication that some of these agents of Satan seemingly would be glad to yield (Ex. 10: 7-11), whatsoever repentance is shown by such servants of Satan, that repentance is not sincere from the heart, but entirely hypocritical. Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to serve notice and warning according to his commandment, that all may’ know that Jehovah is God, and particularly that those of good will may have an opportunity to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. As the plague of locusts came upon Egypt, so not only has the antitypical plague begun, but this plague continues upon modern Egypt throughout all the land of “Christendom”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE NINE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The ninth plague upon Egy’pt was thick darkness over all the land of Egypt except that part of the land occupied by the Israelites, and there the Israelites had light in their dwelling-place. Usually thick darkness strikes terror into the hearts of those who have no faith in God; and since Pharaoh possessed a hard heart and had no faith, he was frightened and desired to be quit of the Israelites when this plague came upon him and his people: “And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: they’ saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed; let your little ones also go with you.”—Ex. 10:21-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> It is noted that in calling forth some of the preceding plagues Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, but in calling forth the ninth plague he “stretched forth his hand toward heaven”; which seems to symbolically say that this message of notice and warning given by divine command pertains to heavenly things, which became totally dark to those making up the visible part of Satan’s organization, and particularly those who form the religious or so-called “spiritual” elements of Satan’s organization. In 1919 the League of Nations was set up as a substitute for the kingdom of God, and which league the clergy, forming the spiritual part of Satan’s visible organization, hailed as ‘the political expression of God's kingdom on earth’. Thus they disclosed the fact that they had no proper conception of God’s kingdom. In 192G Jehovah’s witnesses made public a declaration at the earthly scat of the beastly power of Satan, which declaration set forth that the League of Nations is a child of the Devil and wholly in opposition to God’s kingdom. That declaration, which began at London, England, was a specific notice of warning and was addressed To the Rulers of the World and emphasized the fact that Satan had set up, by his earthly representatives, an abominable thing, to wit, the League of Nations, which makes desolate because it is a hypocritical substitute for the Kingdom. Instead of giving heed to that warning the rulers of “Christendom” continued to scoff at the message, to harden their hearts, and to oppose God. ‘The transgression that maketh desolate’ dates from that time because they then and there had specific notice and warning that the League of Nations is in opposition to the kingdom and is a great abomination to God; and from that time forward thick darkness has settled down upon “Christendom”, (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">Book One, page 137.) Although given full opportunity to know the truth and to identify themselves with God’s kingdom, “Christendom’s” leaders have refused to give heed: “They know not, neither will they understand: they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.” (Ps. 82:5) That particularly marked the time spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, to wit: “For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people : but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:2) From that time onward all the opposers of the purposes of Jehovah God, and particularly the “man of sin” class (Jannes and Jambres), had their “understanding darkened” because of their hardness of heart. (Eph. 4:18) They received notice and warning that they were opposing God and his kingdom, and they refused to hear the message of warning, and to such the prophecy of God applies, “Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.”—Ps. 69:22,23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Jehovah says: “I form the light, and create darkness.” (Isa. 45:7) “Darkness shall pursue his enemies,” that is, those who oppose Jehovah’s purposes. (Nah. 1:8) It was Jehovah who caused the darkness in the land of Egypt; and now darkness by his command is upon Satan’s world. (Ezek. 32:8; Prov. 4:19; Isa. 8:22; Zeph. 1:15) “And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.” (Rev. 16:10,11) There is no part of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ today that has any light of and concerning God’s kingdom. The effort of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to make 1933 a “holy year” has brought no light whatsoever to “Christendom”, but even greater darkness. All light Jehovah has withdrawn from the world. The hypocritical howl of the clergy in their present movement “back to the church” brings no light of relief, but only darkness and disappointment. More keenly now than ever the political and commercial elements of the world, which have trusted and hoped that they would receive favor by the ministration of the clergy, have come to realize that God is not blessing the clergy or any of their schemes. Even thousands of clergymen are now out of a job and have no opportunity of haranguing the people, by which they have heretofore been able to feed themselves. The three days of darkness coming upon Egypt symbolically means that the present-day darkness upon the world will continue and persist until Armageddon, when the whole of the Devil system will go down into the abyss of everlasting darkness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah’s faithful witnesses are now in the temple, the secret place of the Most High, where they enjoy everlasting light from the glory of the Lord and from his King. To the rulers and their supporters of this wicked world under Satan the temple of God is a place of darkness, because none of them can see therein. In the temple Christ Jesus enlightens his faithful remnant and sends them forth as witnesses to proclaim from the housetops the message of God’s vengeance and of his kingdom. (Matt. 10:26,27) After the faithful remnant had received the wages, the “new name”, they resigned from ail connection with “Christendom”. (Zech. 11:9-17) The rulers have been served with notice of warning, and now the remnant, the witnesses of Jehovah, will do what they can for the people of good will that they may hear the message and take their stand. While darkness covers the world, Jehovah continues to turn his light upon his faithful ones, giving them a more wonderful vision of his Word than they ever expected to have while on the earth. This suggests that the battle is near.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Pharaoh expressed a willingness to let the Israelites go upon condition that they would leave behind them in Egypt all things of a commercial value. Likewise the world rulers now make some concessions to those who serve Jehovah God, but this upon condition-; that would make Jehovah’s witnesses go empty-handed before the Lord and be deprived of all means of offering the “continual sacrifice” before Jehovah. God's faithful witnesses will not comply with any such condition, but they will obey Jehovah and not man or devil; and their attitude angers Satan's representatives and calls down upon the heads of Jehovah’s witnesses the expression of wickedness and threats of destruction. This was foreshadowed by the anger expressed by Pharaoh. “And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more [unless I send for you]: for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Murder was in the heart of Pharaoh, and he threatened to kill Moses if he again appeared before him. With calmness and dignity Moses replied to the wicked Pharaoh: “Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.” (Ex. 10:28,29) That was a final warning from Jehovah delivered to Pharaoh by Moses. Pharaoh threw down the challenge, and Moses, as the Lord’s representative, accepted it. The way was now clear for the final plague. It must have been a thrilling moment to Moses. Likewise it must be a time of great joy to the Greater Moses now to see that the hour has arrived when he shall vindicate his Father’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAGUE TEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> From the Scriptures it appears that while Moses was still in the presence of Pharaoh God spoke to him, and that Moses gave a final warning to Pharaoh before he departed. “And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.” (Ex. 11:1) Moses withdrew from Pharaoh never again to communicate with or see Pharaoh except upon the request of the latter; which request was later made. Fear had seized upon Pharaoh and his official household, and they were anxious to be quit of God’s messengers. (Ex. 12: 31, 33) It now appears that the nine plagues have been antitypieally performed by Jehovah’s witnesses at the command of the Lord and under his direction, which messages of truth are still continuing, and persist, and are great plagues upon the rulers of the world and their henchmen. These messages of notice and warning constitute a great plague like a nightmare to the official element of Satan’s visible organization, which would be glad to be rid of the ‘pestiferous’ witnesses of the Lord. This is made manifest by the constant howls that go up from the Roman Catholic hierarchy mid other clergymen, big radio preachers, and others of like stripe, who demand that the messengers be forbidden an opportunity to use the facilities of the world for proclaiming the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses arc now thoroughly hated by all such opposers, and they would find some apparently legal excuse to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. This was particularly made manifest by the recent actions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and their public press, and further at Plain-Held, N. J., when their “strong-arm squad’’ appeared on the scene armed to the teeth, when there was no danger to anyone except to those who could be hurt by the plain proclamation of the truth. That strongarm squad was doubtless there at the instance of cruel Catholic priests, and to this day members of that strong-arm squad cannot understand why they did not commit murder. There is still some witness work to be done amongst the people, and preparation is now being made for the final plague to be visited upon Satan’s organization at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Jehovah had previously told Moses that, when his due time came for the deliverance of the Israelites, “ye shall not go empty,’’ but that the Israelites should borrow of the Egyptians: “and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.” (Ex. 3:21,22) Immediately following the ninth plague Jehovah spoke to Moses and said: “Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.” (Ex. 11:2,3) The borrowing of articles from the Egyptians was not merely for self-adornment, but for use in the service of the Lord by the Israelites. This seems to mean that it is right and proper now for Jehovah’s witnesses to apply for and use any and all of the facilities that the worldly rulers now control and to use them in order for the furthering of the witness work for the kingdom. That means that they are to use the enemy’s own means or instruments against them, such as radio stations, the facilities of the courts, the making of petitions and protests, the lawmaking bodies, which right is guaranteed by the fundamental law of their own land, and by the use of any and all other means to bring to the attention of the people the message of Jehovah’s kingdom. By thus doing they are not asking permission of Satan’s organization to do something, but they are serving notice upon Satan’s organization and demanding that this worldly organization shall cease interfering with the execution of God’s purposes. The borrowing from the Egyptians would also include receiving money by Jehovah’s witnesses in the way of contribution for the literature, and then using that money in the preparation and publication of more literature. Thus the Lord’s people arc diverting some things from the Devil’s crowd into the Lord’s work and service. This is further and conclusive proof that Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a commercial enterprise, such as hawking and peddling and bookselling, regardless of what the worldly tribunals may decide or determine, and certainly regardless of what the clergy and their crowd may say.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Preparation must then be made, and was made, for the final plague, and at the same time for the protection of God’s people. Pharaoh and his official family had spurned and disregarded the notice of warning of the nine preceding plagues, and hence it would have been useless to give Egypt’s rulers any instruction concerning the passover protection; and none was given to them. It appears, however, that. Moses plainly warned Pharaoh that all of his firstborn should die, but not even </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> dog’s tongue would move against any of the Israelites, and that this warning was given to Pharaoh before Moses withdrew from his presence.—Ex. 11: 5-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> Jehovah told Moses that the death of the firstborn would take place at midnight, antitypically meaning at a time of the world’s blackness or darkest period. The blackness of darkness is now upon the world, and must continue until Armageddon. At the command of Jehovah Moses prepared the Israelites by instructing them that each household should on tho tenth day of Nisan take a lamb without spot or blemish and keep it up until the fourteenth day of that month, on which day, in the evening, the lamb should be killed and its blood sprinkled over the entrance into each house and all should go into the house and remain there during the night, roast the lamb whole without breaking a bone, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and while thus doing they should be fully equipped for travel, God saying to them: “It is Jehovah’s passover.” “For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye arc: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 12:12,13) “And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ilam.” (Ps. 78: 51) “He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.” (Ps. 105:36) “And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the laud of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.”—Ex. 12:29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRSTBORN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3S</sup> The final plague upon the world will be at Armageddon. Who constitutes the antitypical firstborn? The firstborn son “is the beginning of his strength&quot;; so declared God’s law. (Deut. 21:17) The antitypical Pharaoh, who is the Devil, has children, and these children include the &quot;tares” and the clergy. (Matt. 13:38; John 8:44) Other scriptures identify more of these children. (Acts 13: 8,10; 1 John 3: 8,10,12) The firstborn of Egypt would therefore picture all of Satan’s children, that is, those of his earthly organization who are &quot;the beginning of his strength&quot;, namely, the chief of their strength, to wit, the leaders and chief ones in the religious, commercial and political branches of his visible organization. The firstborn of every portion of Satan’s organization was destroyed; which antitypically means and includes the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” the “strong-arm squad&quot; and those who put forth their strength to carry forward Satan’s schemes, and also the counterfeit of God’s kingdom, namely, the League of Nations. In this day Satan makes war upon the remnant of Jehovah, the &quot;church of the firstborn”, and would destroy them unless prevented from so doing by the power of the Lord. Tiic only protection that these faithful witnesses have is from the Lord, and this comes by reason of their obedience to Jehovah’s commandment given to them by the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus.— Acts 3:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The slaying of the lamb, and the eating thereof, preceded the slaughter of Egypt’s firstborn. Even so the death of &quot;Christ, our passover”, and the partaking of his merit by the spirit-begotten ones, precede the slaughter of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. As Israel’s firstborn were passed over and preserved on that fateful night, even so the faithful remnant, who are of Jehovah’s firstborn, will be passed over and preserved at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. They will survive Armageddon by virtue of Jehovah’s protection. The “great multitude” will not survive Armageddon, because they are not of the &quot;church of the firstborn” and are not shown in this type or picture. The Scriptures show that God’s promise is to preserve a remnant, and not a vast multitude. (Joel 2:32; Isa. 10:21-23) The “great multitude” are ‘appointed to die’. The Scriptures also show that the Jonadab class will survive Armageddon, but not for the same reason that the Lord will preserve the remnant of the firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER TYPES FULFILLED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> The typical or paschal lamb was taken into the house on the tenth day of Nisan, and this antitypically means in the present day of Jehovah since 1918 the receiving of the ‘Lamb as it were slain’ as Jehovah’s King enthroned in office, hence the receiving of the kingdom and undertaking the full responsibility of the interest of the kingdom. On the tenth day of Nisan, A.D. 33, Jesus rode into Jerusalem and offered himself as King to the Jews; and antitypically this shows that the receiving of the Lamb into the house since A.D. 1918 signifies far more than accepting Jesus as the ransom sacrifice or ‘the lamb that taketh away the sin of the world’. In this day of Jehovah the eating of the lamb would include not only partaking of his merit, which cleanses from sin, but also the having a share in the doing of the work which Jesus Christ was sent to earth to do, to wit, to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah to the vindication of his holy name, hence also entering into the joy of the Lord, which is now the strength of the remnant. Furthermore it means that there must be no uncleanness in God’s organization or among his people resulting from coming in contact with or compromising with the Devil’s organization. There must be no “leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy”, meaning the failure or refusal to confess the Lord before men. (Ex. 12:8,10,15-17; Luke 12:1; 2 Cor. 6:16-18) Jehovah's witnesses must now be entirely separate from Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The Israelites were required to be in haste, with their loins girded, feet shod, and staff in hand, which antitypically means that Jehovah’s witnesses are not of this world nor subject to Satan’s organization and its demands, but are subject to the “higher powers”; that they are on the trek and about to leave the antitypical Egypt, seeing that the wicked organization will shortly be destroyed. (Ex. 12:11) The Israelites must abide in the house, under the blood, until morning; which antitypically means that Jehovah’s remnant are now hidden and are kept “in the secret place of the Most High”, under the protection of Jehovah and his Vindicator, and are thus protected “until the indignation be overpast”, and have there entered, by the Lord’s grace, and have ‘shut the door behind them’.—Ex. 12:22; Ps. 91:1; Isa. 26:20,21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> The blood of the paschal lamb was publicly sprinkled on the doorposts and lintels of the houses of the Israelites, and that antitypically not only means a public confession of the blood of Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s provided redemptive price for mankind, but also signifies to the remnant that all of that class are Judeans, that is, praisers of Jehovah, and arc subject to the orders of Jehovah’s Vindicator and great High Priest, Christ Jesus, the Prophet greater than Moses; and further that the day of judgment or vengeance of God is here, which vengeance shortly will be expressed and exercised in the destruction of Satan’s “firstborn” at Armageddon. Therefore the blood was both a public declaration and a testimony of the approaching destruction upon Jehovah’s enemies. This truth Jehovah’s witnesses, who are his firstborn and who are yet on earth, must declare, because it is an expression of his vengeance. It is true that the blood signifies that those under it say, “I accept Christ Jesus’ blood as my redemptive price”; but to the remnant it means much more. That blood on the doorposts being the blood of the victim which validates the new testament or new covenant, it signifies that the firstborn of the remnant have entered into that new covenant, the primary purpose of which is to bring forth or produce a people for Jehovah’s name and which will have a part in the vindication of that holy name. Upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses the Most High has bestowed the “new name’’, thus showing them to be a “people for his name”. The blood on the door entrances would therefore picture that the new covenant has been inaugurated toward the remnant and hence they must be faithful to the new name which Jehovah has given them, and hence must continue to faithfully bear testimony to his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO MAY CELEBRATE THE FEAST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> It is not for any man or organization of men to determine what individuals may or may not publicly celebrate the Lord’s supper. It is proper, however, to here call attention to the significance of the things pertaining thereto and then let each one assume the responsibility for his actions. Without a doubt many partake of the Memorial emblems without any conception of what they mean. We are now in the “day of Jehovah”, when the plagues are being antitypically fulfilled upon the world. The celebration of the Memorial now means much more than it did prior to the coming of the Lord to the temple in 1918. Those who now properly partake of or celebrate the Lord’s supper as a memorial to the name of Jehovah must have an active personal part in the performance of the ten autitypical plagues upon antitypical Egypt, that is, Satan’s organization. By that is meant that each one must participate in proclaiming the message of God in connection with these plagues. The plagues are now in operation, advancing to the great climax of destruction of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. To partake worthily of the Memorial one must have a part in declaring these truths as Christ has commanded. It was Moses and Aaron who declared God’s word to the Egyptians, which resulted in the plagues. Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, and Aaron, associated with him as his spokesman, represented those of the temple class, the remnant, now on earth, declaring the message of God’s vengeance and bearing testimony of his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Jehovah’s witnesses at the temple are instructed by the Lord Jesus and then sent forth to declare the message of truth pertaining to the antitypical plagues. It follows, then, that those who worthily partake of the Memorial must be in Christ, of the capital organization of Jehovah, and hence in the temple, and must be wholly devoted to God, and engaged in proclaiming the mighty name and works of the Most High, for the reason, as it is written, “in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” Others may engage in proclaiming the message of the kingdom of God, but it is those who partake of the death of Christ Jesus who are the ones that ultimately live with him. Those who suffer the reproaches that reproached him by reason of being Jehovah’s faithful witness, even unto the end, are the ones that will ultimately reign with him. (2 Tim. 2:11,12) Jehovah gave to Jesus the privilege and honor of being his vindicator at the cost of his human life. All who are with him in that vindication must likewise die sacrificially, as Jesus did, faithful unto the end. All of such capital organization are “one bread and one body”, and the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup show forth that all who do so properly are one with Christ Jesus, that is to say, in unity with him as members of his body and therefore in the temple. (1 Cor. 10:16,17) Such, therefore, properly partake of the emblems of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; The question comes back to the primary purpose of Jehovah, which is the vindication of his own holy name. That is why God sent Moses to Egypt; and for that same reason he sends Jesus to the world. All things else are incidental to the vindication of Jehovah's name. The “day of Jehovah”, beginning in 1914, marks the time when Christ Jesus was placed upon his throne and sent forth to rule. In 1918, or three and one-half years thereafter, judgment begins, and then follows the antitypical fulfilment of the plagues upon Egypt, which plagues are completed at Armageddon in the destruction of the firstborn. Therefore it is those who are in Christ as members of his royal house who are the ones passed over at Armageddon, and these are passed over upon condition that they are faithful, abiding in Christ, obeying his commandments; and which means that they must perform the service of bearing testimony before the rulers and before the people of and concerning the kingdom and declaring the vengeance of our God. When this declaration is completed, then will follow the execution of the final plague at Armageddon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The Scriptures, therefore, seem clearly to show that the firstborn of Egypt represent the visible part of Satan’s organization, which will be destroyed at Armageddon, and that the invisible part of his organization, including Satan himself, will shortly follow thereafter, when Satan shall be cast into the pit of destruction.—Rev. 19:19-21; 20:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SIFTING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> At the time that Jesus ate the last passover and instituted the memorial of his death as a memorial to the name of Jehovah the crucial hour in his career as the man Jesus had been reached and he knew that he must die on that day as the antitypical lamb. Doubtless Satan also knew that Jesus would be killed on that day, and, since he had arranged to have him crucified, Satan concluded that he had proved his side of the challenge against Jehovah’s holy name. He knew that he had succeeded in turning Judas away from God. Probably he thought he saw some particular weakness appearing in Peter and, if permitted to do so, he could turn Peter away; and hence he challenged the Lord to permit him to give Peter a special test. “And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (Luke 22: 31,32) Thus the Lord in guarded language showed that Peter would come through that test successfully and that he could afterwards be of strength to his brethren. This will support the conclusion that Satan makes a desperate attempt to overthrow everyone who is worthily partaking of the Memorial. Let all such, then, have absolute and complete faith in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and remain firm and steadfast, regardless of all opposition, and continue to proclaim the name of Jehovah God faithfully unto the end. So doing, they may be assured of complete deliverance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and be for ever the favored servants of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SATAN’S ORGANIZATION: EGYPT</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE primary purpose of Satan is to reproach Jehovah God, turn the people away from him, and compel worship of himself. Knowing that God’s creatures who love Him would sing His praises and worship Him, Satan brought into being his organization, and at the very beginning thereof made religion the most prominent part; and then he makes the commercial and the political or ruling powers a part of his organization, and they adopt his devilish religion. It is the religious element of Satan’s organization that he uses chicfly to blind the people concerning Jehovah God, and therefore the religious element was made the most prominent in the beginning and is the most reprehensible before God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Originally Satan was the beautiful and holy cherub Lucifer. Until iniquity was found in Lucifer he was a part of God’s organization. By reason of his covetous desire to have the worship of creation he produced a wicked religion. By the multitude of his merchandise, or the commercial factor, he has produced violence; and by his selfish desire to rule creation he produced the political or ruling elements, all of which appear in his organization.—Ezek. 28:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was unfaithfulness on Lucifer’s part that caused him to rebel against God and to form the wicked organization called Babylon and become the husband thereof. Therefore Babylon is represented as an unchaste woman and means an immoral organization, and hence it is the mother of all “harlot” systems, engaged in spiritual fornication. The visible part of Satan’s organization, to wit, the earthly governments, is represented under the symbol of “beast”, because harsh, cruel and oppressive. It is the “beast”, figuratively speaking, that carries or bears up the organization of Satan; and she, the organization of Satan, rules over and sits upon the peoples and nations of the earth. (Rev. 17: 3, 5,15,18) The prophet of God calls the Devil’s organization “the lady of kingdoms”. (Isa. 47:5) This is manifestly an ironical statement. The Scriptural proof is conclusive, therefore, that Babylon in the plains of Shinar was organized by the Devil through Nimrod “the mighty hunter’’, and that it represents the Devil’s complete organization, both the invisible part in heaven and the visible human part on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although Babylon was first organized, Egypt was the first nation of great and dominating strength. The predominating factor of Egypt was her military power, whieh stands for the commercial factor of the government. The real reason for building up the military power is to acquire or hold property. Almost all wars have been prompted by a covetous desire to acquire the property of others, and have been promoted by the commercial factors of the rulers of the nations. The wars which Jehovah God commanded his chosen people the Jews to fight were fought either for the execution of God’s judgment against evildoers or to maintain his good name, and were always carried on for good. God is the Giver of life, and he has the perfect rigid to take it away when he secs good. Not so with others. The Devil’s organization has carried on war for a selfish and unrighteous purpose, and has builded great military force for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Egypt was so called by the Greeks and Romans. The Hebrew name for Egypt is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mizraim,</span><span class="font3"> which means “the eneloser or the embanker of the sea”, probably referring to the fact that the first Pharaoh of Egypt turned the Nile river into its course by embankments. This is supported by the words which Ezekiel’s prophecy (29:3) ascribes to Satan, saying: “My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” The name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mizraim</span><span class="font3"> is derived from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mazor, </span><span class="font3">and, according to Doctor Strong, an authority, means “something hemming in, a mound, a siege, and distress”. Sometimes the Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mazor</span><span class="font3"> is used as the name for Egypt. (See Isaiah 19:6; 37:25; Micah 7:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Rahab,” which means “proud”, is the ecclesiastical name applied to Egypt, doubtless because of her pride, arrogance, and boastfulness against God. (Ps. 87:4; 89:10) “The land of Ham” is another designation, probably because of one of Ham’s sons whose name was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mizraim.—</span><span class="font3">Gen. 10: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In ancient times the land of Egypt was very fertile, especially along the valley of the Nile. Its productivity depended on the regular and annual overflow of the Nile river. The people worshiped the river, evidently because Satan used this means to turn the people away from the true God and make them believe that their gods, of which he was chief, brought the blessings to them through the river Nile. The scriptures of the Bible make note of the absence of rain in Egypt. (Deut. 11:10,11) Hail, lightning and thunder were probably unknown to the Egyptians until the Lord sent the ten plagues upon the land of Egypt at the time that he sent Moses there. As it is written: “And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, . . . very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.” (Ex. 9:23,24) The extraordinary phenomenon of the fire, which manifestly was lightning, running along upon the ground, called the attention of the people to the fact that Jehovah was the Mighty God, and made for him a name amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The natives of Egypt were afflicted with skin diseases, denoting a bad condition of the blood; thus suggesting a bad condition because of sin, as the life of all flesh is in the blood. God told his people, the Israelites, that if they would be diligent and hearken unto his voice and do right, then he would put none of these diseases upon them which were upon Egypt. (Ex. 15:26; Deut. 7:15) Disobedience to God would bring upon Israel such loathsome diseases as afflicted the Egyptians. (Deut. 28:27,60) Thus God would teach his people that only he has the power to remove sin and affliction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Egyptians were noted for the use of the horse. The Scriptural record (1 Ki. 10:28,29) is: “And [King] Solomon [of Israel] had horses brought out of Egypt. . . . And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty.” (See also Ezekiel 17:15.) The primary use of horses then was for military purposes. The chariots were drawn by horses, and the chariots were used for war purposes. This arrangement made Egypt a great military power that dominated all the other nations. Because of the misuse of the horse and because it destroys trust in Jehovah God, he, the Lord, docs not speak favorably in his inspired Word concerning the horse, but says: “Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neitner seek the Lord! ’ ’—Isa. 31:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The displeasure of God concerning the use of horses is shown when he directed Josiah to remove them: “And [Josiah] took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house [temple] of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. ’ ’—2 Ki. 23:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemies of Israel came with horses and chariots of war to fight against the people of God: “And the Lord said [at that time] unto Joshua [the commander of the Israelites], Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.” (Josh. 11:6) To hough means to hamstring a horse and make it useless. Later King David did the same thing with the horses of the Syrians.—2 Sam. 8: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the past some students of Bible symbolisms have interpreted the symbol &quot;horses” to mean hobbies and fads and doctrines or teachings which people ride. However, it does not appear that &quot;horses” can properly apply to doctrines; but, in particular, the horse does symbolize war, war policies, and war propaganda, and therefore fitly represents a military organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A further proof that Egypt was a military power is that the Egyptians hated the peaceful occupation of the herders of sheep, such as the Hebrews were. Genesis, chapter forty-six, verse thirty-four, says: &quot;For every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.” It is well known that men or organizations that have used horses and military equipment have little use for the peaceable occupation of a shepherd ; and this was first manifested by the Egyptians, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> Lord has shown it in his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Egyptians worshiped the Devil and practiced the Devil religion. The magicians of Egypt were scribes or horoscopists who drew magical lines and circles, and claimed to state thereby what their invisible gods had determined as to a person. The commercial or military powers were subject to and practiced the Devil religion, as did also the political or ruling power. The rulers were against Jehovah and oppressed the people. With indignation the king said to Moses: &quot;Who is the Lord [Jehovah], that I should obey his voice?”—Ex« 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The religion of Egypt, used of the Devil and dp-posed to Jehovah, is shown by the following Scriptural proofs. To Moses the Lord God said: &quot;Against all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gods</span><span class="font3"> of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord [Jehovah].” (Ex. 12:12) &quot;And it came to pass in the morning that [Pharaoh’s] spirit was troubled [because of the dream he.had had] ; and he sent and called for all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">magicians of</span><span class="font3"> Egypt, and all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wise men</span><span class="font3"> thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.” (Gen. 41:8) Through the prophet Isaiah (19:3) Jehovah said later concerning that &quot;land of Ham”: &quot;And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof; and they shall seek to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">idols,</span><span class="font3"> and to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">charmers,</span><span class="font3"> and to them that have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">familiar spirits,</span><span class="font3"> and to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wizards.”</span><span class="font3"> Still later Jehovah said through his prophet Jeremiah (43:13): &quot;He shall break also the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">images</span><span class="font3"> of Beth-shemesh [or, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of the sun</span><span class="font3"> (margin)], that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gods of</span><span class="font3"> the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hence the organization of Egypt was just as its religion, and that was, devilish, satanical, and opposed to the supreme God of heaven, Jehovah.</span></p>

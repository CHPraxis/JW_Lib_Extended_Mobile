<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The Horse Thieves of High Finance</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font8">F ALL the terrible excoriations Big Business has received at the hands of the statesmen of our time, nothing has ever been published that equals that contained in Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font8"> God is about to vindicate His word and His name and to establish in the earth a reign of absolute righteousness, which is the desire of every honest heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before that reign in all its power and glory can become manifest to all men it is necessary that Jehovah’s enemies lick the dust in Armageddon. In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font8"> Book Two (the work is in three volumes), 199 pages are set apart to the delineation of these enemies of the great and true and just and only God. The chapters discussed in those pages are Ezekiel chapters 25 to 32 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last of those pages are a discussion of chapter 32 of Ezekiel’s prophecy. It is entitled “End of Oppression”. It is an arraignment of the money power, and covers 38 pages. In those pages there are 75 paragraphs. We cannot quote them all, but we quote one, so that the reader may judge for himself of the cumulative effect of the other 74:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Commerce, or Big Business, dominates everything on the land. It is in the saddle, and dictates the terms to the people. Big Business owns practically all the banks and the money in them. It receives on deposit what little cash the common people have, and then uses that cash for its own selfish purposes. Big Business owns and controls the newspapers, the magazines, and other means of advertising itself to promote and carry on its propaganda schemes for exploiting the people and creating public opinion. Big Business owns and controls the armies and all of their equipment, including the air fleets. Big Business owns and controls the legislative and executive branches of the governments. It manipulates, elects and selects its own men to public office. It owns and controls the big lawyers, the judges, the courts, and the officers and seiwants that serve thereat. It owns and controls the big scientists, the engineers, the planners, architects and constructors of public works. Big Business owns and controls the majority of the colleges and the universities, and even the public or common schools. It owns the radio and controls the music that goes on the air, and the musicians that play. Big Business owns and controls “organized Christianity”, and in particular the clergy that serve the same, and also other religions that Satan operates amongst the people and causes them to practice. Big Business owns and controls the natural supply of raw material out of which the clothing for the people is made and the fuel and facilities by which the people are furnished heat and light. Big Business owns and controls the patent rights for all the important machinery used for commerce or trade and also which the people have occasion to use. Big Business owns the people and tells them what they may drink, what they may wear, where they may educate their children, and what they may study, and what they must hear and believe. All of this is Satan’s organization, visible to human eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When you have considered that paragraph for a few weeks you will wonder what there is left to say, and what the other 74 paragraphs could possibly contain. Well, in the paragraph just quoted Judge Rutherford is merely clearing his throat, to get down to business. It is, so to speak, merely a sip at the gallon of boiling-hot coffee next on the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At length he gets to going, and in the subhead “National Banking Act” are ten pages in which he proceeds to pay his respects to the horse thieves of high finance. Here again we are restricted as to space, but present just one more paragraph, to whet your appetite. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The National Banking Act of the United States provided for the establishment of national banks in the following manner: In a city of more than six thousand population such a bank could be started with a capital of one million dollars. Government bonds were then selling for fifty cents on the dollar, and with five hundred thousand dollars in cash one million dollars of the United States government bonds could be bought. These bonds must be deposited with the government at Washington as security for currency furnished by the government to the bank organized. These bonds deposited with the government</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">belonged, of course, to the bank, and the government paid the bank an annual interest of six percent in gold coin on one million dollars of bonds, which had cost the bank only half a million, and which was therefore equivalent to twelve percent interest on the amount invested by the private interests. In consideration of this deposit of bonds the government then issued currency to the bank up to ninety percent of the par value of the bonds, or nine hundred thousand dollars, which currency must be signed by the president of the bank before it was used and was therefore in fact the money issued by the bank. This was a subterfuge to get around the Constitutional provision for issuing money. This nine hundred thousand dollars so issued in currency, the bank could loan at ten percent interest for thirty or sixty days, the interest payable in advance, of course, which amounted to twelve percent on the nine hundred thousand dollars. The bank, of course, received deposits from the people and was permitted to loan such deposited money for its own private use. The national bank, therefore, was really a gold mine. Rothschild Brothers were then the great money kings of Britain. Those money changers conspired with their allies in the United States in putting through the United States Congress the National Banking Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Simpson Confirms the Foregoing</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John A. Simpson, one-time bank president, but now president of the National Farmers Union, Kankakee, Illinois, is one of the American statesmen who knows the truth of the statements above made, and has the courage to proclaim it. From one of his public addresses, given over the radio, we publish excerpts in confirmation which we are sure will be of interest to all our readers. Mr. Simpson said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good many years ago I was president of the First National Bank of Weatherford, Oklahoma. One day, as president of that bank, I lent this government $25,000. Figuratively speaking, I laid $25,000 of the bank’s money on the counter of the secretary of the treasury in Washington. He laid beside that $25,000 for the bank this government’s note bearing interest at a certain rate, payable quarterly, the note running a certain period of years. The note was a government bond with coupons attached. I left the bond with the secretary of the treasury and asked to have the Government furnish me $25,000 of blank national bank notes. The Government very obligingly ran these blank notes in the sum of $25,000 off their printing presses. They were not money until I signed John A. Simpson right over where the Government had printed on each blank note, “President of the First National Bank of Weatherford, Oklahoma.” When I signed these notes there was just as much money in the vaults of the First National Bank of Weatherford, Oklahoma, as there was when I took $25,000 out to lend the Government. In other words, I had just as much money to lend out to merchants and farmers at Weatherford at high rates of interest, and at the same time Uncle Sam, every three months, sent the interest on his note that I had left with him in Washington. Men and women of the radio audience, when Uncle Sam has paid the last coupon on that bond I left with him, he will have taxed you folks listening in, together with other citizens of this country, more than $25,000 and paid it to the First National Bank of Weatherford, Oklahoma, in order to have me sign and make money for the people of the United States to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every time you look at a national bank note, if it is a $10 bill, you can be sure that this government paid the bank that issued that note $10 in interest to have the banker sign it to make money for the people to use. If it is a $100 national bank note, this government taxed the people sufficient to pay the bank $100 in interest for the people to have that bill to use as a medium of exchange. That is your national bank system. You have been told by these cruel, inhuman, criminal international bankers, through the press of the country, that this was a sound money system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In England for a thousand years it was against the law to charge interest or usury for the use of money. Sometimes during that thousand years the law was so severe that the person found guilty of collecting interest forfeited his jjroperty and his children were not only disinherited, but disfranchised. The law at one time provided that a usurer would not be protected from mob violence. In the fourteenth century, under King Edward the Third, usury was a crime, punishable by death. There are English court decisions in which it is stated usurers are ranked with murderers; that taking of money by interest was no better than taking a man’s life.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Old-Style Horse Thief</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">There is an old saying that “nothing succeeds like success”. I remember, 30 years ago, when I came to the state of Oklahoma as a homesteader on a quarter section of land, the business of horse stealing was such a success that those engaged in it were recognized and, to a large extent, respected. Back in those days in Oklahoma many times I have stood in the grocery store where I traded or in the bank where I did business and asked the merchant or banker, as the case might be, the name of some man just passing. He would tell me, and I would ask him, “What is his business?” Without any facial expression of saying something unusual he would say, “He is a horse thief.” I found these horse thieves had made a success to the extent that they had a business standing with the banker, they could borrow money like other business men; they enjoyed social equality with other business men of the town; and they attended church, served as deacons, passed the basket, and were themselves most liberal contributors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the principle that “nothing succeeds like success’’, these men who practiced collecting interest finally conceived the method by which they not only made their business respectable, but made it legal. With blood on their hands they went to legislative bodies and had bills passed that arbitrarily declared above a certain rate was usury and unlawful, while below that rate was interest and lawful. Such laws simply legalized robbery and murder. It legalized the destruction of governments. It legalized the pauperizing of untold millions. It legalized the planting of an economic cancer upon the breast of a nation. In this country that cancer has eaten deep into the prosperity of our people. It has eaten so deep that today recognized authorities estimate the total interest-bearing obligations of the people, the corporations and the various divisions of government to be even greater than the present value of all real and chattel property in the United States. That interest cancer today takes an annual toll from the people of this nation equal to one-third of the national annual income. It is only a matter of a few years, if we permit the monster interest to continue eating into the vitals of this nation, until it will take all the national annual income to pay the annual interest obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The federal government, alone, owes today more than $22,000,000,000. This is an increase of $6,000,000,000 during the last four years. It has increased over a billion dollars since the fourth of March. There are now proposed further increases of nearly $4,000,000,000, which means within a few months our national government’s interest-bearing debt will have passed the high mark of the war period. It will mean this terrible interest cancer will be taking from the treasury of the United States, annually, more than one billion dollars.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The More Efficient Modern One</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">You people listening in at this moment, I want you to know that if the farmers of this nation had all been members of the Farmers’ Union, this session of Congress would never have provided for further interestbearing obligations on the part of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just a few days ago the secretary of the treasury advised that Uncle Sam wanted to borrow a billion dollars so that Uncle Sam might put some men to work building public improvements that become new national wealth. I say to you that it is a crime for this government to pay interest to bankers for that billion dollars to have them sign the money that this government prints. The Government prints the money and should sign it and save the taxpayers the burden of paying interest to bankers to have them sign it. Under present plans, as I have said, this government will soon have outstanding $26,000,000,000 of interestbearing bonds. Under the terms of these bonds, the Government will, in 25 years, pay $52,000,000,000. If those in charge of our government had the courage to sign their own money, it would just take $26,000,000,000 of the taxpayers’ money to pay the obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a disgrace and a shame that the horse thieves of finance—the Millses, the Morgans, the Meyerses, the Mitchells, the Mellons—are still counted respectable and called into Washington by departments of government to get their advice on what is good for the 120,000,000 common people of this country. You 120,000,000 common people are the ones to blame that you permit a handful of ultrarich to rob you of a billion dollars a year of interest. You ex-service boys listening in, they take from your compensation and hand it to these pirates of finance in the form of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I want you to know that the Economic League is made up of such men as Mellon, Morgan, Mills, Meyers and Mitchell. They were the ones that suggested the economy program, passed at this session of Congress. They took two or three hundred million from you ex-service boys. You boys who worked for $1.00 a day and bared your breasts to the bullets, bombs and shells. You faced poison gas and all the hellish instruments for destruction of life that the ingenuity of man could invent while the Mellons, the Morgans, the Millses, the Meyerses and the Mitchells were heaping millions upon millions. They commercialized your blood and the tears of your mothers. Their Economic League has, by law, robbed you of your compensation and added it to their already swollen, ill-gotten fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is out of the unchristian interest system that such crimes come. This devilish interest system is responsible for our international troubles. The Mellons, the Morgans, the Meyerses and the Mitchells and their kind have lent to foreign nations more than $17,000,000,000. These inhuman usurers have conspired with foreign governments to rob the taxpayers of this nation of the $11,000,000,000 foreign countries still owe the Government. The obligations of foreign countries amount to about $500 to the average family. These international bankers, in order to make it easier to collect the $17,000,000,000 foreign countries owe them, are, through their conspiracy, endeavoring to have the $500 they owe each family in this country canceled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unchristian interest system caused the Mellons, the Morgans, the Millses, the Meyerses, the Mitchells, to evade income taxes to the extent of nearly $4,000,000,000. Al Capone, for evading income taxes to the extent of a few thousand dollars, sits in a felon’s cell in Atlanta. These income tax evaders are the little handful of men that you 120,000,000 common people let run the affairs of this nation. You let them make the laws. You let an Andy Mellon administer those laws for twelve long years. I wonder if the most </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">you are not getting what is coming to you. I wonder how much greater the punishment must be to you before you will rise up in the spirit of real Americanism and overthrow these gangsters of finance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Power Trust “Efficiency” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Pennsylvania Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font8">ENTURIES ago James, a servant of Jehovah, foretold a condition that would exist between the laborer and his employer during “the last days” of Satan’s evil world, and legislation recently put in force would seem to indicate that even the lawmakers of this country are beginning to realize that James knew whereof he spoke, and that the laborer has been, and is being, shamelessly defrauded at every turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of the public know that this is true, in a general way, but they are largely unacquainted with specific ways and means whereby this is accomplished, as open fraud is seldom practiced upon employees, by large corporations. Instead, the projected raids upon the pay envelopes of their employees are so glossed over, sugar-coated and mathematically complicated that the individual affected is ready to swear that he is actually the recipient of a favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A good look at some of the tricks and subterfuge used by many of the large corporations to reduce their employees to the state described in James 5:1-5 will, this writer believes, be of interest to many readers of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font8">Doubtless many of them have been, at one time or another, the victims of such practice, but not from the hand of an employer who has developed the art of chicanery, subterfuge and whitewash to the high degree of perfection as has the outfit here concerned, The Power Trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The succeeding observations were made at first hand over a period of several years, and can be amply substantiated in fact by the individuals concerned; and though names and places are readily at hand, for obvious reasons they will not here be mentioned.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Using the Rules Against the Men</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Every large corporation has published rules whereby their employees are supposed to be governed. A certain steam-electric generating plant has such a set of rules, and a copy is given to each new employee when beginning his term of service with the company. No deviation from these rules is tolerated on the part of the employee; but on the part of the employer— Ah! That’s another matter, entirely!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even as the wicked are judged in Luke 19: 22, ‘out of their own mouth,’ so it will be in this article, as we proceed to enumerate their violation of their own rules, and disclose how these rules, originally designed for the employee’s benefit, are used to defraud them under existing conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of us are acquainted with that, sometimes unconscionable, personage, the efficiency engineer. To him is usually entrusted the job of twisting every rule that might be of benefit to an employee, around in the opposite direction, and just what a job these gentlemen (?) of the hardened conscience can make of this will be shown in what follows. Now, let’s have a good look at their handiwork!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Company Rule 2: “In consideration of the 15-minute overlap of watches (8-hour shifts) operating attendants will be given an extra day’s time (8 hours) at the end of the month on the recommendation of the chief operator in each individual case. Whether or not he receives this bonus is determined by his attendance, punctuality, attention to duties and similar conditions.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Stealing 15 Minutes a Day</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">This means that each worker is merely required to be on the job 15 minutes before the time for him to start work, which allows the man relieved to explain any unusual conditions to his relief before going off duty, thus safeguarding the company’s machinery. For this safeguard, the “bonus” is considered to be a remuneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As only efficiency engineers can do it, the possibilities offered by this rule for stealing 15 minutes’ actual work from the forty-odd workers was immediately grasped. The process of accomplishing this was simple. His interpretation of this rule was duly posted for future guidance, and was substantially this: ‘Employees must be at work 15 minutes before the hour, in order for this extra day’s pay to be given.’ By way of clarification to the reader: This meant that an operator temporarily working on maintenance, fitting pipe, for instance, must be at work fitting pipe 15 minutes before his working day started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now oil up your mental arithmetic, gentle reader, and let’s see just what the employer does give, under, let us say, Smith’s ruling. An operator works 28 days per month; 28 times hour equals 7 hours, extra, worked, under the new interpretation. A day’s time equals 8 hours; 8 minus 7 equals 1, hour given. Tsk! Tsk! And they said a day’s time (8 hours) would be given! This could not be a deliberate mistake. Or is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, you say, that’s one hour they are given, anyway. But hold, brother! Had you considered the joker contained in the last sentence of the above rule ? Here’s how that works out; and it can be attested by practically every man in the plant.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Bringing Home the Bacon</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The time card shows perfect punctuality. Your attention to duty is nigh faultless. Your ‘'similar conditions”— Ah! What eyes those so-called “efficiency engineers” have got! And what ears, too! The pay envelope is short that day’s pay. You go into the office and tackle the big shot for an explanation, and here’s what you get: “You made some sarcastic remarks about the management’s being too cheap to replace some burned-out light bulbs.” (What matter if 36 were out, by actual count, in one department?) Another protests that he has been robbed, and gets this one: ‘You remarked, outside the plant, that the First Aid cabinet was in a helluva shape.” (There was not so much as a piece of adhesive tape to bandage a half-cutoff thumb.) And even this, though decent people will doubt it: “You were off three days to your mother’s funeral.” (The days off were without pay, but the all-important 15 minutes extra was not worked. See?) And so on, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum, ad nauseam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For these terrible misdemeanors they steal not only the one hour they promise to give, but seven others with it that you actually worked, so the poor workman has much the same devilish thing pulled on him as the man described in Matthew 12:45, where the one devil not only went back, but took seven other devils with it to plague the man. Truly, ‘the last state of both these men is worse than the first’; but that’s the devil of it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Stealing the Cost of Repairs</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">And now we take up the next little gem, which is Rule 3: “Time and a half will be credited for time in excess of the regular scheduled hours, except such as may be due to failure of men to relieve each other on time, and for any time during the monthly three-day leave. Straight time only will be paid for work during vacations.” Look this one over well before we proceed with the efficiency engineer’s distortion of it, to the defrauding of the worker. Note that only three days’ leave is allowed for one month. What matter if Jehovah God foresaw that man needed one day’s rest in every seven? The Power Trust says, No! What do you think we are?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last sentence of Rule 3 is not in italics in the book, but it may as well have been, for our old friend the efficiency engineer just could not overlook the possibilities in that. After tremendous effort, which must have given him at least half the headache it later gave the employees, it was changed to substantially this: ‘Straight time only will be paid for any kind of work, at any time of day or night.’ Where is the steal in this? you say. We shall have to dig deep to find it, but it is there!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>No Extra Pay for Extra Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Following general practice everywhere, at the time, the working force was cut to a minimum with a vengeance. Consequently, there was but a definite number of men for a definite amount of work, and as long as things went right there was no increase in the amount of work per man. But when things went wrong, someone must work overtime to make any necessary repairs. When this overtime was worked, the company’s solicitude for their health was invoked to compel them to take time off, without pay, for the overtime worked. See it now? You don’t! Well, under the original intent of the rule, if they had to take time off instead of getting paid, they would rest the overtime worked, plus half the amount; which is considered necessary to regain strength expended under the circumstances. These men’s work must be done by someone while they are off duty; obviously by someone aside from the remaining force, in order not to increase the amount of work per man the remaining force already have. No additional help is forthcoming, however, and the work of the remaining force is made so much the harder, as this extra work is absorbed by them. Result: The extra work is a free gift to the company. Neat, isn’t it? Saves hiring and paying other needed men. What’s that about the NRA? Say, listen! Jehovah God tells this bunch to give a man one day’s rest in seven, and they ignore Him! Do you think they will honor the dictum of an earthly organization, when they do not honor that of Jehovah? All right, have it your own way, then!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Defrauding the Operators</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">On to the next fraud, which is Rule 5: “An operating man who is temporarily or irregularly working in the Maintenance Department will continue to be paid on the Operating Department basis. If he works in the Maintenance Department for more than seven consecutive days he will be transferred to the maintenance payroll and will be paid thereafter on the Maintenance Department basis.” You have probably noticed that Rule 4 is skipped; but don’t let that fool you. There is fraud in it too, but it is of minor importance, as it merely says that they ■will pay overtime at the rate of time and a half for all time in excess of 219 hours per month. Certainly they don’t! Now you are catching on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, Rule 5 is the prize theft of all, and requires the skill of a Philadelphia lawyer, almost, to ferret out the fraud. Nevertheless, with minor misgivings, we go resolutely on with it, hoping that the fraud can be made clear with the aid of the less brilliant intellect at our disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To understand it, a short explanation of the difference between Operating and Maintenance conditions and pay is necessary. Maintenance men work 9 hours a day; Saturday afternoons and Sundays off, as well as all holidays. According to rule, time and a half will be paid for work done at a time when Maintenance men are supposed to be off duty. Maintenance work is recognized, in the company’s rules, to be much the harder work, therefore they work a less number of hours per month, namely 210, compared with the operator’s 219 hours per month. During temporary shutdowns (at high-water periods, which are largely seasonal) operators are required to do maintenance work, but are not transferred to the Maintenance payroll no matter how long they do maintenance work. The rule, you will remember, says they will be after seven consecutive days. Let’s see just how badly an operator is defrauded when he works one month on maintenance work, without being transferred to that payroll:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Operator &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 lira, per day 219 hrs. per mo. 3 days off $125</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maintenance 9 hrs. per day 210 hrs. per mo. 7 days off $125 </span><span class="font8">Now suppose they were as good as their word and paid this operator for his month’s work at the Maintenance rate. The result would be this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extra pay for 4 Saturday afternoons .... 4 x $1.20 = $ 4.80 Extra pay for 4 Sundays ........................... 4x 2.50= 10.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extra pay for 1 holiday .............................. lx 2.50= 2.50</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extra pay to help pay a big dividend .................... $17.30</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Gouging Dividends Out of the Men</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The decided advantage of not transferring operators to the Maintenance payroll is very obvious when the above result is multiplied by some 35, operators who work maintenance for an average of four months out of a year. In the year 1932, when honest employers everywhere were losing money, operators worked five months at one stretch, on maintenance, without any transfer’s being made, and that same year this outfit pays the highest dividends in its history. Who paid those high dividends, then? Brother James prepared the answer centuries ago: 'whose wages are kept back by you, by fraud.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The steam electric station here concerned is an auxiliary source of power to two hydroelectric plants, and the cost of keeping its operating force on the job the year around is figured in, and helps to make, the high rate per kilowatt hour to the consumer. In the year 1932, when the general disintegration of the Devil’s organization became unmistakably apparent to the Power Division of his crowd, no other means could apparently be found to keep those precious dividends at the highest level in history than to lay off about one-third of the working force, and compel the remainder to absorb this work at no increase in pay. It required some very high-class salving of outraged feelings to put this one over on the workers, but it was put across, and how!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Raids on the Men Deliberately Planned</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">These raids upon the old pay envelope were always tried out in the steam station, and if there were no serious hitches, they were later imposed on the other departments. The reason for this was that the efficiency engineer was holding his first big job there, and the world had yet to be 'set on fire’ by him in his present capacity. Therefore he was anxious to show the big boys just what he could do, and the big boys knew it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The station was shut down, with no definite information forthcoming as to how long this would last. From a force of some 35 men, 14 were removed from the payroll, ranging in rank from chief operator all the way down to janitor. An additional scare was then thrown into those remaining by forcing some to take one month off, without pay, and others from five to nine days off, also without pay. Those who were left were put on Maintenance work, paid on an Operating basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now it was time for the salve from the efficiency engineer. The men were told that the company was losing money, and to make ends meet it was necessary to get along on a skeleton force, and if the boys did not care to absorb the additional work, the plant might be closed up tight. This was the equivalent of saying ‘Work one-third harder than you have been, or out you go’. This “reassuring^’ admonition was calculated very nicely, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">tempo,</span><span class="font8"> to fit right in with a somewhat payless payday. One operator drew $3.52 for two weeks’ work. One Maintenance foreman drew 10 cents. Another drew merely a notice that $9.62 was still due the company. All skilled labor drawing such pays, in the Power Industry? Yes, reader, and in the same year, don’t forget, of the highest dividends in the company’s history. You see there were deductions for rent, coal, insurance, medicine, stores supplies, and, oh yes! company stock! And what was the effect of a few such pays upon the recipients? Why, these skilled operators and mechanics were now ready to absorb any and all kinds of work: cleaning, scrubbing floors, handling ashes, anything, and that is precisely what they got; xor the 55-year-old janitor was laid off, and the ash man with him.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Hypocritical One-sided “Efficiency”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">As the boys dug into this extra work with a will, they were convinced by the efficiency engineer’s line of chatter that they were doing the company a much needed favor, and were thereby making their jobs more secure. Alas, and also alack! This “efficient” person who so advised them never seemed to lend a hand with the dirty work, nor was his income diminished in the slightest degree, to any of the boys’ knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the boys had ‘taken it on the chin’ they wondered just why this man was apparently in so solid with the company, when he took no reduction in pay nor helped with the dirty and extra work in the company’s “hour of distress”. Now they wonder no more, for they know; and it’s a sad, sad story. He was the tool of the big boys that was used to steal this extra work from them, thus enabling the company to pay the highest dividends of its history, in the year 1932. The only thing the boys wonder about now is whether Jeremiah 25:34 includes efficiency engineers who are without even a shred of conscience, along with “the principal of the flock”, which they know takes care of the big boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hypocrisy and insincerity are not alone confined to efficiency engineers, but are practiced by the higher-ups also, to the hurt of their employees. Sometimes they are caught <sup>f</sup>red-handed’, too, as the succeeding incidents will show. These incidents show no monetary fraud practiced upon the workmen by the officials concerned, but are glaring examples of hypocrisy and insincerity, and are related here, to your amusement, we hope.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Men Penalized for Honesty</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Safety meetings were held each month, and all employees not otherwise engagged (let that spelling alone) were required to attend. It was the privilege and duty of any one of them knowing of an unsafe condition or practice to obtain the floor and tell his fellows about it, that it might be remedied if possible. Before certain things happened, the employees respected Safety meetings more than any other institution of the company. One courageous employee (fifteen years in service, now discharged) told of the company-operated ferry running with a drunken engineer, 30 passengers aboard, and only one life-preserver on the boat. Another told of three men who reported for work in a drunken condition (company’s penalty, immediate dismissal), and upon the matter’s being reported to the superintendent the reply was: “Oh, let them alone! The work has to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now these two items reflected terribly on the respective heads of these departments, and something had to be done about it. And so, what ? In the official’s own words, the employees were turning these meetings into “bolshevik meetings”, and it was speedily arranged that thereafter only foremen would be allowed to make Safety reports at these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The day came when this “outraged” head of the department inaugurated a competition among the various departments, to see which one could go through an entire year without having a serious accident. Accordingly, the boys were given a long-winded dissertation, by this official, on the evils of “horseplay” while on duty; adding that anyone caught indulging therein during this competition would be summarily dealt with. A company rule on this says, also, that it will not be tolerated. Came the elaborate poster for all to note the progress of the competition, having little aeroplanes marked with the name of each department and moving upward for each month that the respective department showed no accident to any employee. Hooray! The steam station was ahead, with a perfect record! The boys had strained mightily to keep out of the clutches of Old Man Accident, and had made a splendid job of it. The competition was almost over and they would most surely win! But why go on with it?—the little aeroplane marked “Steam Station” crashed. He who would deal summarily with any “horseplay” on the part of employees seriously injured his ankle ‘in line of duty’ wrestling with the stock clerk. Horseplay? Tish, tish! And was it mentioned in Safety meeting, how this happened? What do </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font8"> think?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>*The Next Man to Get Hurt’</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Now just in case that you may be forming the idea that the efficiency engineer at least would not be guilty of such a trick, we shall have to relate this one, which is amply vouched for by those present. He was now made chief of the works. The force was at a minimum, and the work was heavy and urgent. Several men were already off with minor injuries, and one poor workman had just inadvertently placed a hand into a coal feeder and had two fingers snipped off for his mental lapse. The rage of the “big shot” was something to behold, as visions of being forced to hire “enough” men to do the work confronted him. “The next man that gets hurt, through carelessness, gets fired,” yelled the “big shot”; and quakingly his men dug yet harder into their tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, three or four men have quite a time moving about a ton of iron that is all in one piece, and the three or four who were doing just that when, let us call him, Smith came on the scene, were no Titans. They had taken up some plates in the floor of an elevated platform and neglected to replace them immediately. Could this “efficient” person see these men straining and tugging and not getting anything done for the money? “Gi’me that bar, there! Now come on, heave, you guys!” The bar slipped; “big shot” dived eight feet onto a concrete floor, on his head, and went out like a light. Put this down to his credit: that he was ashamed to show his face to that gang of men for some time. But don’t fail to put this to his discredit, also: that he has failed, to this day, to keep his word and fire himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The very least these two men could have done to retain a measure of respect from the men under them would have been to apologize for being such a discredit to men who are trying to go by the company’s own rules, and work carefully. But to date, this has not been done; nor will it be, we strongly suspect, until Jehovah God takes away the stony heart of man, and gives him a heart of flesh, and teaches him to keep rules and regulations that are just and right, as in Ezekiel 11:19-21. Read it, ye Smiths, and ye so-called “big shots”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Events in Canada </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TDECAUSE of their zeal in distributing in -C) Quebec city some 45,000 pamphlets telling the good news of Jehovah’s incoming kingdom and of His purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, thirty of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and charged with “having a part in a seditious conspiracy”. In due course they appeared for a preliminary hearing, which resulted in twenty-four being dismissed because of lack of evidence to identify them, while six were sent up for trial at the Spring Assizes. In giving his finding Judge Fitzpatrick said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is not necessary that there be an open attack or that this attack be directed against the government before sedition may be proved. Those persons are guilty of sedition who disturb the peace, quiet, order and repose of citizens, those who introduce a discordant note in what must be a harmonious society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In this city it must be remembered that Catholics and Protestants, French-speaking and English-speaking citizens, live side by side in perfect harmony. All are respectful of the laws and the institutions under which they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Into that picture, however, are injected these pamphlets which are inimical to religion, in which priests and legislators are accused of being the tools of Satan and in which the coming of a kingdom of which no one had previously heard is heralded without any kind of justification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These pamphlets are for the most part the writings of a United States citizen, Judge Rutherford, and have been translated into French so that they might be made more easily understood by the majority of our population.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">That there is too much spread between what the producer gets and what the consumer pays is made very clear in the following Canadian Press dispatch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor W. J. Carlyle, manager of the Prince of Wales ranch near High River, Alta., came to the Royal Winter Fair today with a heated word or two about the price of sirloin steak on train diners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He paid $1.50 for a steak on the diner of the train in which he traveled east, he said, and “we couldn’t get more than two cents a pound for the beef from which that steak was carved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The head waiter told me they had to pay 42 cents per pound for sirloin, and he showed me his bill. That spread is too much.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">War clouds hanging over Europe are displaying a silver lining for Canada, but the grim implications of the millions of dollars’ worth of nickel now pouring out of our export ports, destined for armament manufacturers of Germany, Netherlands and France, are not escaping the attention of the Canadian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no word here of governmental action to curb this export trade, although it is realized that Canadian nickel is going directly into the production of the weapons with which Europe is arming herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Press dispatches Wednesday quote the figures on nickel exports for the first six months of the fiscal year and it is learned at the bureau of statistics that exports in October will be still higher. Private advices received by the cabinet are to the effect that Canadian nickel producers in the past few weeks have received large additional orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Europe is arming with furious speed, and one of the essential means to arm is coming from Canadian mines. Cabinet ministers and senior government officials here decline to comment on this new development. It is explained that so far the purchases of nickel have been carried on by private companies without known governmental assistance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Canada’s representative at Geneva has notified the World Disarmament Conference that this dominion is willing to accept 20,801 as the maximum peace-time strength of her military establishment. We may congratulate ourselves at least upon being precise. A careless nation might have plumped for the round figure 20,000, and a greedy one might have made it 21,000. But no! Canada requires a£nd will insist upon the right to twenty thousand, eight hundred and one defenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who is the one? In certain republics, of course, the one would be the private and the twenty thousand odd would be the generals, admirals and all. But this situation docs not obtain here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have our own theory about him. These figures are put forward at a disarmament conference. Canada is only following the Geneva technique if she employs a bargaining figure. The one doubtless represents the hypothetical man whom we will proceed hypothetically to disarm. Canada, in fact, may yet break up the conference in disorder by making one of the first unconditional offers to reduce forces. We may then claim a flat 20,800.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font8">TRATFORD, Ontario, is a furniture center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of the furniture factory employees are ex-service men, veterans of the World War. They went on strike for better wages, and straightway the government sent down a detachment of soldiers with machine guns and tanks to overawe them. As there had been no violence, nor threat of any, the workers refused to negotiate till the machine guns and tanks were withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After their negotiations with their employers had been completed, the ex-service men felt that they still had a score to settle with the governments that have treated everybody so badly, and so twenty-one of them, members of the Canadian Legion, got together their medals and sent them to the finance ministers of Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Austria, Bulgaria, United States of America, Japan, Portugal, Belgium, Greece, Serbia, and India. Along with the medals they sent the following message, in English, German and French:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Fifteen years ago we laid down our arms, victorious over the forces of greed, nationalism, armament and war. Our victory was rewarded with these victory medals. Today nationalism flourishes, greed is rampant, armaments menace our homes; and war impends. The fruits of our victory have vanished. There remain to us who fought nothing but our memories, our medals and the war debts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The memories we shall ever cherish. The victory emblems, now empty emblems in defeat, we surrender, one to each combatant nation, to be melted down into metal and swallowed with all other rewards of armed conflict in payment of the war costs of the world.”</span></p>

It is of supreme importance to the people that they discern the issue involved and that they take their stand on one side or the other. If Jehovah be God, follow Him; if the Devil, the god of the Dark Ages, be God, follow him. The question is up for determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was in his address “Jehovah’s witnesses: Why Persecuted?” broadcast over the United States on Sunday, May 1, 1932, and published in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> of May 25, 1932, page 520, that Judge Rutherford made his original challenge to the clergy of the Devil, in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I therefore invite the organization known as the Federation of Churches of Christ in America, together with all Catholic and Protestant organizations, to confer together and to jointly agree upon and select one man to be their spokesman in a nation-wide debate by radio. Let them pay one half of the expense. Jehovah’s witnesses will supply the money for the other half. Jehovah’s witnesses will select a man to be their spokesman in this debate. Give the people a fair opportunity to hear and to determine for themselves what is the truth. I charge that the clergymen are hindering the people from learning the truth, and I therefore name the following issues for debate, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved, (1) That the clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, do not represent Jehovah God and Christ, but that they do represent and serve Satan the Devil;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) That the clergymen do not teach the people the truth as contained in the Bible concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom, and that therefore they and their church organizations are a detriment to the best interests of the people;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(3) That the Scriptures clearly teach that within the present generation Jehovah God will completely destroy Satan’s organization, including present governments on earth, and that only those people who seek meekness and righteousness by taking their stand on the side of God and His kingdom may hope to be saved in that trouble, and that those who do serve and obey the law of God’s kingdom will be granted everlasting life on earth in peace and prosperity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(4) That those who are opposed to the message which Jehovah’s witnesses are now carrying to the people by radio and in printed form are fighting against God and will receive a just recompense at the hands of the Lord for so doing.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>The Pope Also Given a Chance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">A year later, Judge Rutherford having in the </span><span class="font8">meantime given his address “Effect </span><span class="font9">of Holy </span><span class="font8">Year on Peace and Prosperity”, and the Roman Catholic church having thereafter, and because of that address, made strenuous attempts </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font8">have him cut off the air, wherever that could be done, he extended a special invitation to the pope for a public discussion and consideration of the following proposition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Resolved,</span><span class="font7"> That the Holy Scriptures prove beyond doubt that the head of the papal church system and its many priests who act officially under its direction do not act by the authority of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and do not represent God and Christ on earth, but said Catholic institution is a part of this world and operates under the supervision of the god of this world, that is to say, Satan, the Devil, and that thereby the people are deceived and kept in ignorance of the truth, which truth is now vital for them to know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This challenge, which is merely an application of the original challenge to one organization, appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> of May 24, 1933, page 536. Judge Rutherford has no other challenges outstanding than these to the Federation of Churches and the pope.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Not Challenging Clergy in the Bread Lines</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">There are estimated to be about 200,000 clergymen in America, any one of whom, individually, would no doubt welcome the opportunity to get a free advertisement that he is to debate with Judge Rutherford over the radio. There are now thousands of these clergymen in the bread lines. They would be glad to do anything at all to get more comfortable quarters even for a night. No challenge was ever made to these men; it is presumptuous for any of them to suppose that they were ever addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How could a debate between Judge Rutherford and any man who is either in the bread lines or near the bread lines be in any way an honor to the name of Jehovah God, and how could it in any way determine the great question raised?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the moment, men who claim that they are entitled to debate with Judge Rutherford by reason of his challenge are blustering about and making many broad statements, and it is due the public and these upstarts that we set forth the facts. The challenge made by Judge Rutherford is his challenge to the combined clergy, and according to all rules of debate that challenge must be either accepted or rejected.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Terms of Challenge Perfectly Plain</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The terms of Judge Rutherford’s challenge as set forth above are perfectly plain, and readily comprehended by anybody who understands English, yet the only ones who have made any pretense of giving consideration to this challenge are those of the “Church of Christ”, in which organization there are no clergymen whatsoever. These letters Judge Rutherford has ignored for the reason that not one of them complies with the terms of his challenge, for at least the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) No one in that organization even claims to be a clergyman;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) Not one of these men has received the backing or endorsement of the Federation of Churches and the Roman Catholic organization;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) Not one of them has made any pretense of offering to pay half the radio expense, which would be at least $50,000.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">It will be noted that the challenge is to the Federation of Churches of America, together with all the Catholic and Protestant organizations, and that the clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, do not represent Jehovah God and Christ, but that they do represent the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This challenge does not include men outside the clergy, because it would be useless to have a debate with every one who wants to advertise himself. Judge Rutherford is not trying to advertise himself, nor will he lend himself to advertise some nondescript.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His position is that “organized Christianity”, so called, made up of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Protestant clergymen, are serving this world, the Devil’s organization, and are not serving Jehovah God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and whenever this combined element will select one man to represent them in debate and agree to comply with the terms of the challenge, it will be more than gladly accepted.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Parkersburg’s Pompous Precocity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Among other letters received (in an extremely round-about way) was one addressed to Mrs. Herzog by a person using the letterhead “The Church of Christ, Parkersburg, W. Va.” in which appears this statement: “Judge Rutherford does not seem to want to debate with anybody on a reasonable proposition or on fair terms. . . . We have set him down as a coward.” This from an unknown entity to a man whose addresses go forth from 350 radio stations every week, to a man whose books have a circulation of over 150,000,000, to a man who calmly faced sixty men, armed to kill him, and gave them his address “Religious Intolerance: Why”, published in full in our issue of August 16, 1933, one of the boldest, bravest and best addresses eve-given. Anyone who knows Judge Rutherford would not believe for a minute that he is a coward; but for a man who claims to be representing the Lord to resort to the language of the street to bolster up himself proves such a man hardly competent to discuss God’s Word with anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The real purpose of the proposed debate by Judge Rutherford is to get before the people the fact that “organized Christianity” as a body, and which is represented by its clergymen, does not serve Jehovah God, and its clergymen are therefore not qualified teachers of the Bible. He has no personal desire to engage in a controversy with any individual. This is a matter in which the people of America are interested, and they are not interested in Elder Corbett or Deacon Davis or what they may have to say about the matter. It would not carry any weight after they would say it. If the “organized religionists” claim to be representing- God, then they ought to be able to select one man who would be outstanding and represent the whole crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses, going from door to door with the message of God’s kingdom, should be very particular to refer all persons interested in these challenges to the challenges themselves. If they would do this they would save themselves and the would-be debaters and ourselves much trouble. Not one of the would-be debaters has yet met even one of the conditions laid down by Judge Rutherford; and unless all the conditions are met, then the debate will not be held. The challenge has been repeated in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> several times; no one has dared to accept it as laid down; and for anyone to try to stage a comeback by saying he has accepted the challenge, when he knows he has not done so, is to commit a peculiarly clergy-like act.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>“Back to the Church”—Under the Guidance of Columbia’s Palsied Hand</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T SHOULD not be thought that we are speaking of your Uncle Samuel. His hand is a good distance from being palsied. It shakes a little, to be sure, but that comes from drinking too much coffee. In six months he cut down the unemployed from 15,000,000 to 10,000,000, and that is not the job of a tottering paralytic. The one we are speaking about is the Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. Its chief counsel has the shivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He received the announcement set forth in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 371, issue of December 6, 1933, pages 144, 145, which please see. With the announcement, which, it will be remembered, puts on every radio station owner the responsibility of deciding whether free speech in America must be surrendered to the ‘pope’, there went Judge Rutherford’s lecture, “Religious Intolerance : Why,” which he gave in front of machine guns at Plainfield, N. J., July 30, 1933, and which appears in full in our issue of August 16. This lecture it was proposed should be rebroadcast by electrical transcription on December 31, 1933 (and it was so broadcast by more than 125 stations).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the leading radio station owners, when the question was put squarely before him, had the manhood to say: “We see nothing wrong with the copy of the speech sent, by Judge Rutherford, ‘Why Religious Intolerance Is Practiced Now in This Country.’ In fact, we are more than glad to have such speech to go forth from our station. We have had plenty of trouble with the Catholics in the past, trying to get this station off the air.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But no such manliness was revealed by the chief counsel of the Columbia Broadcasting System. He was shocked that in his introduction A. K. Wagner referred to the Catholic clergy of Plainfield as “the servants of Satan”, that he mentioned that city as a place “where a farce trial was had by a highly prejudiced judge”, and that at that trial that unrighteous judge had “wrongfully compelled” innocent men and women to answer questions. He could not conceive that “without any lawful right or excuse” such persons were thrown into jail, nor dared he face the charge that for centuries “the Catholic hierarchy has operated the most cruel, wicked and defamatory organization that has ever been on earth”, and “when they want someone killed” make provision to absolve the killers of all blame. He was alarmed when Wagner mentioned that “the judge of the court who had conducted the farce trial” “and who had defamed the name of Jehovah by his public declarations” had been in Judge Rutherford’s audience when the judge had given this “Intolerance” lecture. All this over the introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next the chief counsel turned white around the gills because in his address proper Judge Rutherford calmly stated in the presence of sixty police officers of Plainfield that “even the chief of police of this city has asked the owner of this theater to cancel his contract” and mentioned this as a “sinister influence”. He turned white some more when the judge himself mentioned that more than fifty good citizens, known to be harmless, had been arrested “without warrant or cause” and then were brought before a “so-called court” and “summarily convicted in the absence of law or evidence” in a “farce trial”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The white became yellow around the edges when the judge mentioned Constantine’s adoption of “Christianity” “manifestly for a selfish purpose” and when he touched on “the fires of torture” by which the people of Italy, Spain, France, Mexico and other places “were compelled to support the Papal religious system or Catholic hierarchy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The yellow spread toward the center when the judge in his address called down “shame upon those public officers who have been ready and willing to class Jehovah’s witnesses as selfish peddlers and hawkers in order that they might serve their own selfish ends; shame upon the lawyers who practice upon the bench and before the bar, who because of fear of losing some personal advantage have side-stepped the issue and failed and refused to decide squarely the question as to whether or not men can be prevented from preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom by the enactment and enforcement of municipal ordinances leveled against hawkers and peddlers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, finally, the chief counsel nearly passed out when Judge Rutherford denounced the ‘pope’s’ “Holy Year” as “a presumptuous sin before Almighty God” and said (referring to the proposition that the clergy of the Papal hierarchy represent the Devil and not Jehovah God): “I challenge the pope of the Catholic hierarchy to appoint any man he will on earth, to represent him and his organization, and that we debate this question by radio before the American people, each side to pay one-half the cost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chief counsel gives us a pain. If he were a magistrate and a man would come running into court with his clothing torn and his eye blacked and said he had been pitched upon by a priest and robbed, instead of investigating to see if it were true he would immediately have the man locked up as a suspicious character. Or if a maiden came to him in distress stating that a priest had dishonored her and betrayed her he would take her to one side and bid her hush her complaint, as it is 'a thing not to be mentioned’. It is men like this that have ruined the world. Give us men like Judge Rutherford instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford confidently expected that a few would be offended when this speech was widely broadcast, but he confidently anticipated that every honest person, even though temporarily offended, would happily acknowledge the truth when he learned and considered all the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The truth on each of these points, which the speaker is abundantly able to corroborate with much proof, is set forth in the speech as a whole and in books now available to the public in more than sixty languages. The marked statements are not mere references to “shortcomings” or unintentional blunders committed by unauthorized members of the Roman Catholic church, but the proof shows that these statements accurately portray deliberate and studied action of men who occupy positions of leadership in the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The people are entitled to know that these things are going on at a time when a nation-wide effort is being made to get everybody “back to the church”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Summit, New Jersey, Rebuked by Supreme Court</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N ANOTHER part of the world a government under Roman Catholic influence has entered upon a great sterilization program involving hundreds of thousands of persons, but the cabled dispatches say: “No member of the Catholic Church need submit to sterilization if relatives or the church pay his living expenses under internment, and the church is free to open ‘internment institutes’.” This is a thoughtful arrangement for the convenience of priests and other Catholics who do not wish to be sterilized. We commend it to the consideration of such persons, already sterilized mentally, as may wish to submit to the remaining formalities, and thus aid the world to become, in time, Roman Catholic in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Summit, New Jersey, some time ago embarked upon a somewhat similar course. Being a Roman Catholic town, and having a Roman Catholic chief of police, the brilliant idea was evolved that by placing in his hands the right to grant or withhold approval of the distribution of literature from door to door an arrangement could be worked out that would make Summit a closed preserve for the political arrangement centered at Vatican City. An ordinance was framed with that end in view. The ordinance was particularly intended to discriminate against Jehovah’s witnesses, as the facsimiles of warrant and complaint published in our issue of June 7, 1933, plainly show. In those documents, signed by Patrick J. Kelly, the Watchtower International Broadcast and Judge Rutherford’s books are specified by name, these terms being </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">printed</span><span class="font8"> in the documents themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Summit council framed that legislation they evidently forgot to consult Thomas Jefferson, noted American, framer of the Constitution, who said, to the delectation of all true Americans, but not to any papist: “Our legislatures are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us. The idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aware of their natural rights to preach the gospel from door to door in Summit, and knowing they could not be legally restrained from distributing literature referring to the Watchtower broadcasts, Jehovah’s witnesses proceeded with their rights and some were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In due time these matters came up before the Supreme Court of New Jersey, when Jehovah’s witnesses were upheld and the Summit ordinance was rebuked in the following language, which suggests that the Roman Catholic sterilization process is not having the unbounded success in the “Holy Year” hoped for:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“By the terms of the ordinance, the permit is to issue only upon the written approval of the chief of police, who is given absolute discretion in granting or withholding his approval without any determining factors other than his own impulses. The reservation in an ordinance of discretionary powers to a public officer to give to one and withhold from another the privilege of violating the ordinance is condemned by our cases. No legislative authority is cited for such a provision. It is unreasonable that a chief of police, with no rule of determination except his own wishes, should determine who is and who is not to distribute advertisements. Furthermore, the provision that charitable and civic organizations of the City of Summit shall be granted the permit without charge, while like organizations from outside the city are charged a fee at the rate of $10 per day per person, is not a reasonable exercise of the ordinance power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let Them Return to Whence They Came</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE Puritans in New England, the Orangemen in New York, the Quakers in Pennsylvania, and the Huguenots in Charleston came to this country to get away from the Roman Catholic church and all the abominations that go with it, including its parochial schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was the above-mentioned people that made this country an asylum for the oppressed of all nations. They threw the doors wide open, and in came the oppressed Roman Catholics by the million, and their priests and parochial schools along with them, and now they want to run the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The statement was recently made that of 212 postmasters of large cities, appointed by the Roman Catholic postmaster general, 200 are Roman Catholics, like himself. How did he come to let in 12 Protestants?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Robbed of their liberties in Roman Catholic lands the Roman Catholics have come to America and are bent on robbing Americans of their liberties and of their own as well. If they do not like American schools and other American institutions founded by the people that founded the country, let them get out and go back to the land whence they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is said in all good spirit and in all earnestness. Why try to make worshipers of the ‘pope’ feel at home in a land which was never theirs and which, despite all kowtowing in high places, shall never be such?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ohio and other states the priests are making a desperate fight to get their hands on public funds wherewith to run their private schools. There should be an amendment to the Federal Constitution absolutely forbidding the use of public taxes to finance private schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Persecution of anybody is wrong. Why persecute Roman Catholics who do not desire American institutions, American laws, American schools or even American rulers, but are content only with papal institutions, papal laws, and papal catspaws in place of rulers? Let them go back to whence they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first settlers came 3,000 miles to get away from them, and it is unfortunate that they left any maps showing which way they came; but, now that maps are available, let those that were educated in the parochial schools, if able to interpret the maps, pick out some place as remote as possible from America and go as quickly and as far as they are able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Military Symbolisms in Austria</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">H</span><span class="font8">ENCEFORTH a crucifix must hang in the barracks of every unit of the Austrian army, and a representation of the virgin Mary must be printed or embroidered on every flag. Carrying out the idea suggested we are wondering where Jesus and the apostles would fit into this scheme. Jesus was betrayed and slain; will His name be used on the cenotaph? Peter cut off somebody’s ear with a sword; will the weapons be named after him? The apostle John had a vision of horses; will the cavalry be named for him? Judas had the treasury; will this be the name of the paymaster’s department? </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ghost </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gas</span><span class="font8"> spring from the same root word; will this provide the name for the poison-gas department? Will the airplanes be named after the angels? And where will the Devil come in on this thing, all built to his honor and to the defamation of the name of Jehovah God? The chaplain provides the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Kissing Their Way Down the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aria Bernadette Soubirous, who is supposed to have seen a vision of the virgin Mary at Lourdes, France, in 1858, was formally proclaimed a saint December 8, 1933. The account says that at the ceremony the cardinals kissed the pope’s hand, the patriarchs, archbishops and bishops kissed the cross on his stole (or scarf), while the abbots and penitents kissed his foot. It seems as if, wherever one goes in these days, the middle classes get the worst of it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Demons Entrap a London Ex-Elder</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8">T OUR Lord’s first advent the demons (fallen angels) acknowledged Him, saying, “Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.”—Mark 1: 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout our Lord’s ministry these evil spirits were in evidence in the two men of the Gergesenes, the dumb man, the blind and dumb man, the daughter of the Syrophcenician, the lunatic child, Mary Magdalene, and the demoniac of Gadara, out of whom they went into a herd of swine. Every casual reader of the Scriptures is familiar with the repeated instances in which these demons were cast out by the Lord and the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford has always consistently taught that those who, when they know the truth, do not go on to serve it with good and honest hearts, may be expected to become engulfed sooner or later in some form of demonism. Such an experience has happened to a man once an “elective elder” of the London (England) congregation, now resident in Gloucester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Like all that are caught in the trap, this man is probably entirely unaware of what has happened to him. He imagines that he is receiving spirit messages from Charles Taze Russell, first president of the International Bible Students Association; as a matter of fact he is taking messages from a fallen angel that for centuries has been getting his principal enjoyment in making fools out of humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first address that this man received from this source was supposed to be on “Redemption”. It was merely bait, but, short as it is, contains proof that it was demon-inspired. It says, “By his love; by his precepts and example; that is how we are redeemed by the blood of Christ.” The statement is false; we were redeemed, purchased from Justice, by the sacrificed life of Christ Jesus, given as a substitute for Adam’s life. Demons always try to sidestep the doctrine of the ransom.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Characteristic Demonistic Expressions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Twice in four pages this man has been led to refer to what he has been pleased to call “revelations of God’s glory”. Those “revelations” in both places use the expression “tier upon tier, realm upon realm”. A still later leaflet from him uses the same expression again. This expression, nowhere found in Scripture, is a characteristic expression of the demons. Just what their purpose is in wishing to convey the impression that in the spirit world everything is on shelves just so far apart is a matter of guesswork. Probably the object is merely to dishonor Godby making everything appear unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is another quotation: “(Turning, and addressing himself to some of the undeveloped spirits, near by) ‘0 ye afflicted, He will come for thee one day; thou also He will bring.’ (Turning again to the friends) And thus did Jesus preach to the spirits in prison.” This explanation is entirely contrary to Pastor Russell’s, that Jesus preached to the spirits by His obedience unto death and by His resurrection from the grave. He taught them by example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another quotation says, “Know ye not that spirits do His bidding even in the hells?” The Scriptures do not show that the demons or other spirits ever were in any hell. He continues, “This same Brother Russell, but now in spirit, is amongst us all once again.” Let us hope he never gets any farther than Gloucester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The demon that has confused this man uses poor English, which Charles T. Russell did not do. Once he says “thou” where it should have been “you”, and once “he” where it should have been “him”. Twice “you” occurs where it should have been “ye”, and twice “he” is used as a pronoun in such a way that it cannot be definitely known who is meant. Five times “thee” is used instead of “you”, and five more times “thy” is used where &quot;your” would be the correct pronoun. Flirting with the witch of Endor, and other witches since, has made the demons careless in the use of pronouns; sixteen errors in four pages of manuscript are too many, even for an unclean and fallen spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Kisses for Sale”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE Dunton Presbyterian church, Greater New York, put out a dodger having the caption “Kisses for Sale” and containing the picture of a beautiful woman. Not sure just what this means, but if it means what it says, then business at the church fair ought to be good. The Lord and the apostles do not seem to have hit on this easy way of making the church a paying concern.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“The men who put forth the Watchtower program all declare that there is about to be a great change on this earth, that Christ came in 1914 and is ruling to a certain extent at present time, but is getting ready to overthrow Satan and make a pleasure garden out of the earth for a thousand years. But they claim that worse times than we are now having must come first, as the battle of Armageddon must be fought and it will be the greatest battle of all times. The Watchtower people say it is the Millennium, and that many of the people who are living today will never die but will live with Christ upon the earth for a thousand years. . . . During the thousand years there will be ... no trouble or crime of any kind, no dying. Everybody will live in harmony. They claim the Bible is just about fulfilled, that the Devil will soon be out of a job, and that Jehovah God will rule right here on earth, and many will never die.”</span></p>

I think I can show you another just as freakish, namely, the squaring of numbers having a % fraction attached. For example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2y<sub>2</sub>x 2i/<sub>2</sub>= 5/2 x 5/2= 614</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3y<sub>2</sub>x 3i/o= 7/2 x 7/2= 1214 191/2 x 19% = 39/2 x 39/2 = 380%</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is nothing new or unusual about this, but look:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of multiplying 19% x 19% as follows 39 x 39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2x2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' 351'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">117</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">4)1521</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">380%</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">just draw a line on your two % fractions and add 1 to upper 19 and say 19 times 20 = 380, plus 14 = 38014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2% x 2% =2x3= 6, plus 14 = 614 514 x 514 = 5 x 6 = 30, plus 14 = 3014 1714 x 1714 = 17 x 18 = 306, plus 14 = 30614 914 x 914= 9x10= 90, plus 14= 9014</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is always correct and is very rapid, if you know the double multiplication table.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Chicago farmers adopted resolutions condemning the farm policies of the United States government and sent out an appeal to all farmers to fight the trusts, bankers and big monopolies. They expressed the conviction that Roosevelt was brought forward by Wall Street; that the new deal was designed to help financial interests at the expense of the working masses, and that the AAA and refinancing program are intended to crowd out the small farmer. One gets the impression from these statements that the farmers are not quite satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace told the Association of Land Grant Colleges that the government may use compulsory measures to enforce the acreage reduction program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T APPEARS that Agricultural Adjustment Act Administrator needs more wisdom and insight than human creatures have thus far been endowed with. Not only the supply of farm products, but the prices and trade practices incident to marketing them, must be regulated, and before he got started various groups of interested parties began to send in codes which had to do with food industries. They came in by the hundred, including codes for bee-breeding, and for the manufacture of such items as dog food, licorice, Hawaiian poi, stogies, and fish industries. The idea is to please everybody all around. However, the most important objective was to limit supply, either by destroying foodstuffs or by raising less than the farms will produce. The gentleman to whom the unenviable task is assigned might take a pointer from the first A. A. A. A. of whom we have any record. We have in mind Joseph, who handled this job for Pharaoh, and who made it his first concern to see that everybody had enough to eat and that there was something saved up for an un-rainy day. But, then, Joseph lived in a “less enlightened age”.</span></p>

Some of the farmers had signed agreement with the government to cut down or reduce the wheat crop. Now their checks are coming through from the government in settlement of the agreement. But instead of sending the checks direct to the farmers they are being sent to the county treasurer at Eaton and the farmers are told to go to the courthouse for them. When the farmers arrive for their checks they are told that they are behind with their taxes and these government checks must apply to their delinquent taxes, and the county treasurer refuses to turn the checks over to the farmers. Are the farmers mad?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">rpiIE effort to raise farm prices continues, the object being to raise the farmer’s purchasing power so as to raise the distribution of things the farmer buys, which in turn will raise the income of business men (and may even raise the wages of workers, though this is doubtful) and thus raise things in general from the de pression which continues in spite of the fact that there is an abundance of everything. Meanwhile farmers have been raising a rumpus because the raising of farm products has not enabled them to raise a sufficient income to raise their families as they deserve to be raised and could be raised if profiteers had not raised everything on which they could lay their hands beyond the reach of those who need those things.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Raising Prices of Farm Products</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T IS hard to understand why there is so much to-do about raising prices of farm products. We read recently of a Gonzales (Tex.) farmer who shipped a cow to market by truck, and after freight, commission and weighing were deducted, he received 35c in stamps. This means that if he had shipped a thousand cows to market he would have received 350 dollars. It is easy to see that all a farmer has to do is to ship enough cows to market and he will have no end of money! (Somebody just suggested that it probably cost the farmer something to produce the cow in the first place. We hadn’t thought of that. But, then, it seems that no one else has given it much thought either.)</span></p>

Mr. Oldham has just given his employees a half interest in the plant and made arrangements such that they can purchase the other half at just about the actual cost of the assets. If America had a few more men like Mr. Oldham and a few less like Insull the country would not be in its present condition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">E DO not know just what happened in Yakima, but the United Farmers League tells the world that their secretary, C. M. Bos-kaljon, somehow got into jail and the sheriff obligingly turned him out at night to be welcomed by a mob of masked chamber of commerce vigilantes. He was stripped and flogged and his head was shaved in the form of a swastika. In view of these interesting clues we are not surprised that the Farmers United Front Conference in Yakima was smashed.</span></p>

Wilson is working out a project in-volving the removal of some agricultural lands from production for the market and trying to get industrial workers to use them for growing thereon food sufficient for their own necessities. Hence the term “Subsistence Farms”. Small farmers, not without cause, consider this a measure that threatens their welfare. It would seem that any proper measures to “help the farmer” would exempt the smaller farms from any reduction in the amount of their acreage.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill and Allied Items</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE Tugw’ell Medical Slavery Bill* proposes to take away from the poor the right of self-diagnosis, which has always been theirs, and the right of self-medication, which, except in the case of infectious and contagious diseases, has never been questioned, and to turn it over to the Medical Trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitherto an anxious mother of limited means could obtain from the crossroads or corner drug store a medicine which she believed beneficial in the relief of whooping cough, but if the Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill goes into effect she will not be able to do it without first obtaining a prescription from a doctor; and she may not have the means to consult one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that the so-called “patent medicines” are merely the favorite prescriptions of certain physicians for the accomplishment of certain ends, and it is also well known that more than half of all the prescriptions written by practicing physicians call for such patent or proprietary medicines, but the Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill proposes to bring all these remedies within the grip of the racket commonly known as the Medical Trust, and to make them unobtainable except upon prescription, at much greater cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The courts have wisely ruled that “every human of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body”, and the Public Health Service of the United States government is on record that “within certain limits, mature, otherwise sane persons have the right to select and take their own medicines”; but when the Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill goes into effect they would have those rights no longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the federal judges has observed: “It is generally known and the evidence shows that with very few exceptions there is no known cure, using that word strictly, for any disease. Nature, supplemented and aided by proper medicines, careful nursing and proper diet does the work of curing.” The truth of this observation is apparent to all. Distorting this truth, the Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill would make it illegal to mention the name of a disease upon a label unless in letters of the same size and prominence there also appears a statement that the drug is not a cure for such disease. The intent of that rule is to make the would-be purchaser mentally dependent upon some physi-</span><span class="font5">* The proposed new Food and Drug Act. </span><span class="font8">cian, and upon an illegible Latin prescription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just how it benefits a patent medicine to have it taken back into the sandwich department and poured into another bottle is a mystery that only the American Medical Association can solve; but it must be admitted that it does help the medical fraternity, whose facility in glorifying and enriching themselves at public expense is known and read of all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Tugwell Medical Slavery Bill gives a list of the afflictions of mankind, which includes albuminuria, appendicitis, arteriosclerosis, blood poison, bone diseases, cancer, carbuncles, cholecystitis, diabetes, diphtheria, dropsy, erysipelas, gallstones, heart diseases, high blood pressure, mastoiditis, measles, meningitis, mumps, nephritis, otitis media, paralysis, pneumonia, poliomyelitis, prostate gland disorders, pyelitis, scarlet fever, sexual impotence, sinus infections, smallpox, tuberculosis, tumors, typhoid, uremia, venereal diseases and whooping cough. If in the corner store the bottle so much as mentions one of these, then there is trouble ahead for the maker and dispenser, under this new proposed Food and Drug Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above list is only a starter; it may be added to from time to time by the secretary, and he may from time to time impose such regulations regarding processing and packing as will give the American Medical Association the stranglehold upon the American’s windpipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meantime some are calling attention to the fact that in Chicago 700 physicians are receiving help from charitable organizations and many are actually in the bread line as a reason why they should reach out and take everything as do leading citizens in other walks of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">GENTLEMAN in California writes us of the experience of his daughter: “Here is what she witnessed over and over again when she was with a children’s specialist. One of his favorite stunts was to puncture infants’ ear drums, on the off chance of finding a little pus and the near chance of a fat fee for services rendered. In only about 3 percent or 4 percent of the cases was there any pus, but the percentage of collections ran satisfactorily.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE people of the United States are dying mentally. Between 1880 and 1931 the number of insane persons in state hospitals increased from 64 to 236 persons in every 100,000 population, but owing to the great increase in the population there were seven and one-half times as many to look after in the latter year as in the former. Besides those that are actually insane, it is found that four out of every ten who apply for treatment at dispensaries are mentally shell-shocked. Besides these there are 10,000 feeble-minded annually to look after; and on top of all this there is an ever increasing number of chronic alcoholics and drug addicts. The Big Business efficiency experts have driven the country at such a merciless pace that the common people could not keep up. The ones for whom this was done have not a particle of interest in the people, nor in anything or anybody but themselves. They should not be allowed to hand down their colossal fortunes from one generation to another except in fragmentary form, and their income taxes should be greatly increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From One of the World War Soldiers</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8"> HAVE always thought </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> wonderful, particularly of late, but when I read the paragraph referring to the Reverend John Kelman, on page 107, of the issue of November 22, and your rich sarcasm, I wanted to hug you. Your quip about the soldiers is quite true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the early months of the war, when I was barely 22, I was having a stroll with a friend about my own age, when we were stopped by an Anglican parson, complete with 'dog’ collar and evidently the heart of a vicious cur. He snarled out at me the customary slogan of that time: “Why aren’t you in khaki? Kitchener wants you.” I was so dumfounded at the command to go and kill from a pretending minister of the Prince of Peace that I simply could not think of a reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “Reverend” then turned to my friend, who had just passed an examination for the degree of M.A., and used all power of persuasion to get him to, what he termed, “take orders.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few months later, owing to the influence of such &quot;dogs” and the serpentine press, I did join up. A long time after demobilization I had to take to my bed, owing to a recrudescence of a disease common to army life, the secondary symptoms giving me terrible pains. It was while lying at a relative’s that I received a pamphlet which one of Jehovah’s dear witnesses had handed through the door. (God bless him or her.) The result was, I read and continue to read everything published by the Society. I love Judge Rutherford with all my heart and soul. (I wish you would tell him, dear friend, that although I have never seen him, the more he writes, the more I love him, and ceaselessly pray that the heavenly Father’s richest blessing may always be with him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Already I have reveled in the world of truth compressed into the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font8"> and had my whole being thrilled through and through with that amazing final chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As I look back it seems that Almighty God had given me the privilege of being a Jonadab years before the type of Jehu and his companion was revealed to the church; and how my heart overflows until the tears run down my cheeks when I realize the invitation was not extended to a Christian “convert” who had reached a high degree of 'character development’, but was lovingly granted to a young man suffering with a loathsome disease! Just whether that vile creature was the very first Jonadab is known only by Jehovah. Bless His holy name.</span></p>

There is nothing mysterious about it. It was manifestly a wholesale poisoning due to the fact that food had been left standing in aluminum utensils until it was unfit for any use whatever. There have been scores of like cases, and there will be scores more. As an arrangement for keeping people in permanent ill health nothing was ever devised that beats aluminum cooking utensils.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Louis J. Paul, of Michigan, having read the article in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 319 on “Wasting—Saving—Using”, cites uninteresting case of wastefulness in nature. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Thought that you might be interested in knowing that there is also a great wasting in nature. For example: In the text book on Obstetrics written by Dr. J. Whitridge Williams, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., the following statement is made: 'The number of spermatozoa contained in a single ejaculation is marvelous, and has been estimated by Lode at 226,257,900.’ I have said that this is a great waste, but it is possible, of course, that I may be mistaken. There may be good reasons for such a large number. You undoubtedly know that it takes only one spermatozoon and one ovum to cause fertilization and ending in the formation and birth of a human child.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>Two Great Mysteries</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH has reserved the choicest wisdom of all time for those who love Him. This wisdom has been a profound secret to all except those who are helped by the power of Jehovah to understand it. It is just like the Eternal One to show His special favor upon those who manifest faith in Him and who diligently serve Him. This is not by the arrangement of man or any other creature, but of God. If the arrangement were of man we should have strong reason to doubt the value of the scheme; but it is of Jehovah, and that makes it reliable. The inspired apostle Paul said that he so spoke “that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God”. (1 Corinthians 2:5) Today too many put reliance and confidence in creatures, and this only leads to sorrow and bitter disappointment. It is better to trust in Jehovah than to put confidence in men and princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A mystery is that which is kept a profound secret. It is something unknown, except to contain ones, being carefully and continuously concealed from all others. It is startling to note that most of the Bible was not understandable until quite recently; and it is understood now only by those who show faith in Jehovah; and this understanding is not given to the end that the creature alone may profit therefrom, but that the name of the Most High might be honored. A little seed is dropped into the soil in the springtime, and what it will become is known only to the planter. Later the tiny plantlet pushes its way through the soil, and finally a beautiful flower appears. The creature may use or destroy this flower for his own selfish purposes; but the man of wisdom sees in the delicate petals and the intricate lining of the corolla the handiwork of the Creator, and for this his mind speaks praises to the Most High. Even so the truth is now revealed to those who have faith, that they may use it in honoring Jehovah.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Parables of Jesus</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus was on earth He taught the people in parables or dark sayings. His disciples came to Him and asked: “Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.” (Matthew 13:10,11) It will be observed that He did not say, “You now know the mysteries of God’; but that it was given them to know those mysteries. Not even His disciples understood Him in many things when they were with Him. On the last night before His crucifixion He was instructing them in various things that would be helpful to them in the days to come. On that occasion He said: “When he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” (John 16:13) The spirit of truth here mentioned is the holy spirit, the spirit of God, the invisible power operating upon the minds of those who are in covenant relationship with God. Jesus here used the masculine pronoun in speaking of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The holy spirit was given to the disciples at Pentecost, that is to say, fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus. “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4) The King James Version of our Bibles translates the word here holy “ghost”, but there is no warrant for such a translation. It comes from the word which means spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was at Pentecost that for the first time the mystery of Christ began to be understood by the disciples. This mystery has been a stumblingblock to both Jews and so-called “Christians”; but in God’s due time He will make known to all the secret of this mystery, and then all rightly exercised by this will rejoice with exceeding joy.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Two Mysteries</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The mystery which we shall first consider is THE CHRIST, the great one through whom redemption, deliverance and blessing will ultimately come to all mankind who receive Christ and obey Him. God foreshadowed His mystery for ages by the use of various men. Yet all of that time He kept it secret. The other mystery of the Bible is that relative to Jehovah God himself, which has lately been revealed and which we shall subsequently examine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two mysteries are important because they give us an understanding of Jehovah God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">purposes concerning the vindication of His own name and the blessing of all obedient creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Death has been and is the great enemy of man. Death is the very opposite of life. The greatest desire of man is and always has been to have life everlasting in happiness. From the time of his expulsion from Eden man has been looking for something upon which to fasten a hope for life and happiness. Satan was the cause of death, and when God pronounced the sentence in Eden He said that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head. This statement was in the nature of a promise, but it could not then be understood. Since Pentecost some have understood the meaning of these words to be an assurance that in God’s due time the seed of promise, the seed of the woman, will destroy Satan, who has the power of death. Nearly two thousand years rolled by, after this statement, before anything further was promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then unto Abraham Jehovah called and made him the promise: “In thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.” This was another reference to the mystery of Christ; but that promise was not understood in its proper light. Abraham believed God would bless the human race, but he did not understand just the manner in which it would be done. At the time of this promise Abraham had no children. Several years more passed and then Isaac, Abraham’s first son, was born. Abraham believed that his natural seed, his son, would be the ruler through whom the blessing would come to the people; but his son Isaac was merely a type of the mystery, God using him to foreshadow the greater One. This promise was renewed to Isaac and to Jacob, and at the death of Jacob his descendants, who, of course, were descendants of Abraham, were organized into twelve tribes, forming the nation of Israel, and were thereafter recognized as God’s chosen nation. (Genesis 49:28; Deuteronomy 26:5) Then it was that the faithful believed that God’s promised blessings would come through this nation, His chosen people. But in time they became slaves to the Egyptians and their hopes were almost blasted. They were sorely oppressed in Egypt, when </span><span class="font9">God sent .Moses to be their deliverer and to lead the people of Israel out of Egyptian bondage. Moses was also a type foreshadowing the great One. (Acts 3:22) Moses died and the promised blessing had not yet come. The prophetic statement made by Moses that God would raise up </span><span class="font8">unto Israel one like unto himself led the </span><span class="font9">proph</span><span class="font8">ets to understand that there would be a great one raised up from the nation of Israel who would be the deliverer and blesser of mankind.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Awaiting the Deliverer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Joshua followed next in line after Moses. </span><span class="font9">His </span><span class="font8">name signifies savior or deliverer. But he also was only a type of the great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then David became the king of Israel. His name means ‘beloved one’. The Jews had hoped that he would be the great deliverer, but in his old age he abdicated the throne in favor of Solomon, and yet the blessing did not come. Solomon became the most famous man in the world for riches and wisdom, and the hopes of Israel were centered in him, only to be disappointed. David and Solomon were also but mere types foreshadowing the coming great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The nation of Israel degenerated, and under the reign of Zedekiah, their last king, they fell into captivity to the Babylonians and they continued subject to other nations until they were finally driven out of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moved by the holy spirit of God operating upon their minds, the holy prophets testified of the coming of this great Deliverer, both of </span><span class="font9">His </span><span class="font8">sufferings and of His glory that would follow; but they did not understand. The matter </span><span class="font9">was </span><span class="font8">a mystery to them. (1 Peter 1:11) Even the angels of heaven sought to look into it, but they were not permitted. God’s purpose was to keep the matter secret until His own due time to </span><span class="font9">re</span><span class="font8">veal the great truth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>Jesus Revives Hope</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Then came Jesus, whose coming was announced by John the Baptist; and </span><span class="font9">He was </span><span class="font8">pointed out as the one who would take away the sin of the world. He chose His disciples and they walked with Him, and He taught them for three and a half years; yet they did not understand the great mystery. They expected Jesus to be made an earthly king, and hoped that they might be with Him in the kingdom, probably in His cabinet, because He was asked if one might sit on His left and the other on His right hand in the kingdom. They expected Him to make Israel a great nation, and believed that through that nation other nations would be blessed. </span><span class="font9">When He was put to‘death they were greatly disappointed, mystified, and in great distress. (Luke 24:21) Even after His resurrection they did not understand His mission; and this is </span><span class="font8">shown by their words to Him on the day that He ascended into heaven. “When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the holy spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judrea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.” —Acts 1: 6-9.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>Holy Spirit Given</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">In obedience to the command of Jesus, these faithful disciples went to Jerusalem to the place known as “the upper room”, and there waited. Ten days passed, and then it was that the holy spirit, the invisible power of God, was visited upon them; and, true to His promise, the disciples began to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus had now ascended on high and presented the merit of His sacrifice before Jehovah, and the acceptance of this was manifested by the giving of the holy spirit to His disciples who had been His consecrated followers for three and a half years. Doubtless the angels of heaven now began to know something about the great mystery. What joy must have been in heaven when Jesus Christ appeared before the Father and presented the merit of His sacrifice and was received by Jehovah! Surely the heavenly host must have sung His praises. They had beheld Him triumphing over death and the grave and now exalted to a position in heaven next to the Father for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It must have been a great joy to the heavenly host, even as contemplation of it was a great joy to Jesus himself. “For the joy that was set before him, [he] endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12: 2) What joy must have filled the hearts of His disciples when they began to understand the mystery of God and to see how wonderfully He had led them and their fathers before them, preparing them now for the revelation of this great truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In due time Saul of Tarsus, who afterward was named Paul, was illuminated, and understood. And then he wrote: ‘Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church; whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which [mystery] is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Colossians 1: 24-27) The apostle here emphasizes the fact that this mystery is now made known only to the saints. “Saints” means purified ones, which purification comes through receiving the merit of Christ’s sacrifice.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>Anointing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The word “Christ” signifies “anointed”. “Anointing” means designation to official position in God’s arrangement. The Christ is the instrument for the vindication of the name of Jehovah and for the blessing of mankind. The Christ is composed of Jesus, the great and mighty Head, and 144,000 members. (Revelation 7:4) Christ Jesus is the head, and the church, His body. We ofttimes hear the expression ‘a body of men with a general at their head’. Of the Christ the apostle says: “And he [Christ Jesus] is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.”—Col. 1:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle Paul uses a human body to illustrate the Christ, the great mystery class; the head representing Jesus, and the other members of the body those who are of His church. “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. Now ye are tbe body of Christ, and members in particular.”— 1 Corinthians 12:12, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Christ is also designated in the Scriptures as the seed of Abraham according to the promise. “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16) Addressing himself to the church, followers of Jesus, the apostle further said: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:26,27,29) This is the “seed”, then, through whom the blessings will come to all the families of the earth. “Church” means a gathered-out class; and so the period from Jesus’ first coming until His second coming is employed by Jehovah for the selection of the church, the seed of Abraham, through which blessings will come to all the remainder of mankind in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Footstep Followers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The members of the body of Christ, the church, are also designated as His footstep followers; and as such they are called to suffer with Him, that they may also reign with Him. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Peter 2: 21) These are also designated as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Christians. </span><span class="font8">Because one is a member of some earthly organization called a “church” it does not mean that he is a Christian or a member of the true church. The true church is the body of Christ; and any one, to be of the true church, must be a follower of Christ in the truest sense of the word. To this class are given the exceeding great and precious promises recorded in the Bible, among which is the promise of being associated with Christ Jesus in His kingdom. (2 Peter 1:4) Not to the world, but to His followers, Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Revelation 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one has been able to understand these things and appreciate them except those who have given their hearts to the Lord. The apostle Paul says: “The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (1 Corinthians 2:14) Jehovah has so arranged that only those who have their minds illuminated by the holy spirit, which follows their consecration, justification, and acceptance by the Lord, can understand and appreciate this mystery. After one becomes a true follower of Christ he must continue to joyfully obey God’s commands if he would continue to have an understanding and appreciation of the truth as set forth in His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mystery of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The physical facts before us today agree with Bible prophecy, as found in The Revelation, that the seventh trumpet has sounded: “In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.” (Revelation 10:7) “The mystery of Christ” pertains to the selection of the ‘seed of promise’, without regard to whether they be by birth Jews or Gentiles, and it shows the gathering of the body members of the Christ with Jesus as the Head. (Ephesians 3:4-6; Galatians 3: 27-29) There seems to be a clear distinction between the “mystery of Christ” and the “mystery of God”, which latter mystery should be finished during the sounding of the seventh angel. There are a number of questions relating to Jehovah which were a mystery to God’s people and which have been cleared up to them since the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to His temple, in A.D. 1918, and particularly since the year 1928. For instance, the questions: Who is God? What is the significance of the names by which He reveals himself? Is God responsible for all the sorrows and woes of earth, including the calamities? Has He an organization, and what is it ? What is meant by His coming forth “out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth” and to vindicate His name? (Isaiah 26:21) What is the organization that opposes Him, and of what does it consist? Is Satan and his organization responsible for the sufferings and calamities of men and the alienation of men from God? All these things God had long ago foretold or announced by His prophets; but the time must come for them to be understood by His faithful people on the earth, because it is for their benefit that the Scriptures explaining these vital questions were written.—Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By His prophet Jehovah said: “Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret [mystery] unto his servants the prophets.” (Amos 3:7) Therefore the statement of Revelation 10:7 seems to say that following the sounding by the seven angels God would cause His servants to have an understanding of the prophecies which have heretofore been secret. Those w<sup>7</sup>ho compose the remnant of His servant class now on earth have received a great enlightenment, notably since 1928, and now have an understanding of many prophecies that have heretofore not been understood. This is due to the fact that “the Lord is in his holy temple” (Habakkuk 2:20), and the flashes of light from His temple illuminate His faithful people.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>The Degree of B.D.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">E HAVE before us a communication addressed to the president of an Ohio board of education. It is typewritten on a letterhead which would lead one to suspect that it is from “Reformation Evangelical Lutheran Church, The Community’s Spiritual Lighthouse, 2460 Tremainsville Road, Toledo, Ohio, Reverend W. Rufus Rings, B.D., Pastor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Knowing that D.D. stands for Dumb Dog (Isaiah 56:10-12), the pastor (pronounced pahstah) wins the degree of Bad Dog from us because of the manner in which he manifests his caninity. He does this by three pages of closely written matter, not worth reprinting, which assume to give the reasons why a school auditorium promised for a transcription lecture by Judge Rutherford should be denied. It is hardly worth while analyzing a dog’s barks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The kernel of his canine uproar is that Judge Rutherford was not patriotic in 1918, when the United States was fighting Germany, and then he says: “I also call attention to the fact that this same group was the first religious organization to be barred from Germany after Hitler assumed charge because it taught lack of patriotism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. It is as though, along late in His ministry, the Devil had met Jesus and reproached Him with not being patriotic, either as a citizen of the Jewish nation or a citizen of the Roman government. The only answer Jesus could have made is that His business was to preach and teach of the coming kingdom of Jehovah God as the only hope of the world. He felt no burdens resting upon Him to stand up for Judaism or for the Roman arrangement; the priests and hypocrites would attend to all that, for that is their business, and the only business they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is one good thing in Reverend Rings’ letter. He says: “In 1926 this organization, called 'Jehovah’s witnesses’, stated that the clergymen of the United States, together with their coconspirators, claimed the ability to set up God’s kingdom on earth without God and have endorsed the League of Nations and declared it to be the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, thereby breaking their allegiance to Christ and declaring their allegiance to the Devil, the god of evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You did not mean to do it, Rufus, but that time you told the truth.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark175"></a>INTOLERANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">A New Booklet by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Is there </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">religious intolerance</span><span class="font13"> practiced in the world today?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Here’s an example:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">On a certain Sunday in June, 1933, more than 50 Christian men and women were arrested in Plainfield, N. J., and crowded into three small cells and kept there overnight without trial. These Christians had called at the homes of people and had told them about God’s kingdom. This was the offense for which they were arrested. Because of their preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, the Catholic clergy in that community had induced law officials to cause the arrest of these good people. The treatment of these Christians was so outrageous that it shocked the sensibilities of honest people who heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the time Judge Rutherford was in Europe and, being informed of the persecution of these Christian people, he immediately cabled to engage the best auditorium in Plainfield and certain radio stations to be used to convey his speech which he would deliver to the people on the subject WHY IS RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE PRACTICED IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY? When Judge Rutherford stepped to the front of the platform to speak he was literally surrounded by armed men as though he were a desperate criminal. With guns to the back of him and in front of him and on every side he delivered the speech which you will have the privilege of reading in the booklet entitled INTOLERANCE. You, too, will probably be shocked at the revelation made concerning religious intolerance practiced in this present hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Upon a contribution of 5c toward the advancement of the truth contained in this booklet, we shall be pleased to send you a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Anyone who desires to have a part in the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom can fill in the coupon and begin witnessing with INTOLERANCE. If you desire to associate yourself with a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, write to The Watch Tower, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y. If you live in Canada write to The Watch Tower, 40 Irwin Ave., Toronto 5, Ont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Religious intolerance is practiced in Canada as well as in the United States. The clergy there have brought pressure to bear through the radio commission of Canada to take Judge Rutherford’s lectures off the air. This religious intolerance was practiced just last year. The Catholic clergy and religious organizations have also arranged to have Jehovah’s witnesses arrested and thrown into prison. In spite of all this persecution during the past year, note the splendid results of the witness work in Canada.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">The Peoples Pulpit Association is a non-profit membership corporation, created and organized under the laws of the State of New York. Associated with it is the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, also a nonprofit corporation, created and organized under the laws of Pennsylvania. Associated with these two organizations is the International Bible Students Association, a corporation created and organized under the laws of Great Britain. These three corporations are in fact one, having the same executive officers and working always together with the same objective in view. Because those who support and carry on the work of these corporations do so for the sole purpose of giving testimony of and concerning Jehovah God and Uis provision for the blessing of the human race such persons are known and designated as Jehovah’s witnesses. This appearance and statement is made in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses. For convenience the three associations named, together with their supporters, are hereinafter called ''Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Religion properly defined is a form of worship of a god based upon a ritual, creed or statement of belief. Religion may be educational to a degree and it may not be. It is often employed to keep people in ignorance concerning the truth. The Peoples Pulpit Association and associated corporations are not religious organizations but are formed and carried on for the purpose of informing the peoples in matters of most vital importance to them. These associations do not seek members, and practice no form of worship, but all of them endeavor to worship The Almighty God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The radio is not a human invention. It is God’s creation permitted by Him to be brought into action in these last days for the enlightenment of the people. The proper use of the radio would be to honor Jehovah God the Almighty Creator. While the Almighty God could, to be sure, confine the use of radio exclusively to His service, it pleases Him to permit men to exercise their free will at this time in the use thereof, thus giving men an opportunity to honor or to dishonor His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan, the great adversary of Jehovah God and who rules the present evil world, seeks to deceive all men and turn them away from the true God. A great responsibility therefore rests upon the men into whose hands the radio broadcasting control is committed to see to it that the people have a full and fair opportunity to hear the truth of God’s Word, that they might freely determine for themselves what course to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Created and organized for the purpose of informing men concerning the vital truths as contained in the Word of God, commonly called the Bible, the Peoples Pulpit Association in the year 1923 built a radio station at New York known as WBBR and since February 24, 1924, has continuously operated said radio station for the benefit of the people particularly in matters pertaining to the Word of God. For convenience and pleasure of the people it also broadcasts programs of world news, classical and semi-classical music (vocal and instrumental), pipe organ, dramatic presentations, and lectures on health, household and agricultural subjects. That station has never broadcast a program for hire. It does not engage in any commercial business. No member or associate thereof receives any pecuniary profit from the operation of the radio station or from any other part of its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That this Commission and Congress may have a clearer view of Jehovah’s witnesses, their work, and why they appear here, we beg to submit the following further facts, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More than four thousand years ago Jehovah God, as stated in the Bible, promised to establish a righteous government upon this earth, with Christ Jesus as the invisible King. That promise is certain to be faithfully kept and performed. Two thousand years later, at the birth of Jesus, it was authoritatively declared that He should be Jehovah’s instrument to bring peace on earth and good will toward men and this He would do at His coming and His kingdom. The nations of the world are now in great perplexity and distress. The only hope for peace and prosperity, life and happiness among men is the kingdom of God under Christ. For this reason that which is of greatest importance to the people just now is information and knowledge of and concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several years ago careful and honest students of divine prophecy reached the conclusion that 1914 would mark the beginning of a great world change culminating later in the greatest time of tribulation ever on earth, which trouble will result in the overthrow of Satan and his unrighteous organization, and that such overthrow will be by the invisible armies of Jehovah, led by Christ Jesus; and that then will follow perpetual peace and prosperity on earth. The physical facts which began to come to pass in 1914, and which have come to pass since that date, fully support these conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seeing some of the truths of God’s Word, and having a keen desire to know more thereof, and a desire to be of help to their fellow-man in learning the truth, honest men and women from all religious denominations, and without regard to any creeds, came together and organized the aforesaid associations, the members of which are now known as Jehovah’s witnesses. They have had but one objective, and that is to give information of and concerning these vital truths to the people who desire to hear and learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The main office of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is at Brooklyn, New York, from which are directed the activities of branch offices in more than thirty-five different nations or countries of the earth. For the sole purpose of advertising the name of Jehovah God and His kingdom these men and women have built printing plants, published and distributed great numbers of books and other literature, built and operated radio stations in different parts of the earth, and used other proper means to carry forward their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ Jesus is designated in the Scriptures as Jehovah’s ‘True and Faithful Witness’. When on earth He declared: ‘For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.’ (John 18:37) The true followers of Christ Jesus therefore must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah God, and His Word, the Bible, because His Word is the truth.—John 17:17.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Opposition</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Throughout the earth there is great opposition to the message delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses. This Commission and Congress are entitled to know the reason therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan the Devil is the great adversary of Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ, and is also man's worst enemy. To save repeating the proof upon this point reference is made to testimony given at the hearings before the Committee on Merchant Marine, Radio and Fisheries, House of Representatives, Seventy-third Congress, second session, on H. R. 7986, appearing particularly at the bottom of page thirty-five and pages following, a copy of which testimony is filed herewith and marked Exhibit A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan’s method of opposition to the truth as delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, according to the Scriptures and the facts, is to deceive and thereby blind men to the truth and cause them to vigorously oppose the truth. Satan’s chief agents or instruments used for this wrongful purpose are religious organizations, and particularly the leaders thereof, as revealed by the Scriptures and the facts.—2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4; John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Controversial</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses have no controversy with men, although they are bitterly opposed by some men. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is to get the truth to the people. Necessarily the truth is controversial because it exposes error, and that was the sole reason why religionists opposed Jesus when He was on earth. It is the expressed will of God that a knowledge of the truth shall he brought to men. The proclamation of the truth provokes controversy, and this is proved by the Scriptures and the indisputable facts.—1 Timothy 2: 2-6; John 15: 19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of the wrongful practices in the use of radio stations, and because of the unjust methods employed to prevent the people from hearing the message of truth by radio, a petition was circulated and signed by approximately two and one-half million citizens of the United States and presented to the Seventy-third Congress. In keeping with Satan’s methods of false representations the statement has been made and widely published by certain religious papers that the names signed to that petition were obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. I here brand that statement as a deliberate and infamous lie, which has been published for the purpose of prejudicing this Commission and the Congress. The petition was plainly printed, submitted to the people, and was voluntarily signed by those persons who did sign it. That petition and protest thus signed and filed is in Avords and figures, to wit, To The Congress of the United States of America: Greetings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We, the undersigned people of the United States of America, capable of determining for ourselves what we wish to hear broadcast by radio, without censorship by the clergy or anyone else, hereby protest to the Congress against certain wrongful interference with our rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The radio act provides, as we understand, for the broadcasting of that which is in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The message of the true God, JEHOVAH, as expressed by Him in the prophecies of His Word (the Bible) and as now being given to the people of this nation by Judge Rutherford and others of JEHOVAH’S witnesses, is of interest to us. When broadcast, it is convenient for us to hear it in our homes and is necessary for our welfare. We are entitled to hear and desire to hear that message. We disapprove of every attempt to prevent our hearing it broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and others, have wrongfully by threats, coercion and other improper influence prevented many stations from broadcasting this message of truth, thus depriving stations of legitimate income and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear; and against this wrongful action we vigorously protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Exercising the right guaranteed to us by the Constitution of the United States, we therefore respectfully petition the Congress to act at once to safeguard the inherent rights of the American people relative to the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The petition was signed by the greatest number of persons that ever signed a petition presented to any Congress of the United States up to this time. Hearings were had by the Congressional committee above referred to on H. R. 7986, and also before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 8301. The testimony submitted at those hearings and made of record is herewith filed as a part of this statement, and marked Exhibits A and B.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Broadcasting Methods</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">A brief resume of methods employed and practiced by certain broadcasting corporations and others during the past ten years is here appropriate that a proper understanding may be had as to why there should be a change in the allocation of time and of broadcasting channels for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Radio Station WBBR above mentioned was originally assigned a very desirable frequency. At the instance of others that channel was taken away from it and a far less desirable channel assigned. Since then WBBR has operated under a handicap to the disappointment of many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The programs broadcast by Jehovah’s witnesses are designated Watch Tower programs. In July 1927, by courtesy of the president of the National Broadcasting Company, the chain facilities of that company were used to broadcast a Watch Tower program from Toronto, Canada. Much interest among the people was aroused and such a great demand for further nation-wide broadcasting of these programs that application was made on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses to the National Broadcasting Company to hire its facilities at convenient times for broadcasting other Watch Tower programs. Although Jehovah’s witnesses offered to pay the commercial rate for the use of such chain facilities, the applications were denied, and subsequent applications have been denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The chief reason for the denial of such applications has been and is the influence exercised over the National Broadcasting Company’s officials by religious clergymen. Yielding to such influence of clergymen, the National Broadcasting Company made and promulgated a rule that no one shall use its facilities for broadcasting Bible talks except they be first approved by its religious advisory committee. Accordingly, that corporation has repeatedly refused to permit anyone to use its facilities to give to the people information on the Bible. It has restricted broadeasting of its so-called religious programs to certain Catholic, Protestant and Hebrew clergymen approved by its own committee. Stated in other phrase, the National Broadcasting Company acts as the self-constituted religious guardian of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The motive for this manifest face-about change clearly appears. In view of the fact that the president of the National Broadcasting Company so courteously permitted the use of its facilities to Jehovah’s witnesses on one occasion, its change of position is due, without doubt, to influence exercised over its officers by professional religionists, and hence against the interests of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Columbia Broadcasting System, admittedly following the lead of the National Broadcasting Company, adopted and follows a similarmethod. Contrary to the Congressional mandate, both of these chain broadcasting companies have thus deprived the people from hearing that which is of public convenience, interest and necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In order to meet the public demand, and in order to get this vital information to the people, Jehovah’s witnesses were compelled at stated times to build up a private chain broadcasting arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such chain broadcasting, thus privately established, has been accomplished by cooperation </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the Bell Telephone organization. This private arrangement has entailed an unreasonable expense for Jehovah’s witnesses. Such exorbitant cost and expense they have been compelled to bear during the past seven years, and in addition thereto they have been unnecessarily and unfairly excluded from many of the most desirable radio channels and stations in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past seven years, for private chain broadcasting of only 128 program hours, Jehovah’s witnesses have been required to pay more than $600,000. Had these same programs been broadcast over the entire facilities of the National Broadcasting Company or the Columbia Broadcasting System at their highest commercial rate, the cost to Jehovah’s witnesses would have been less than $200,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Private citizens of America have thus been compelled to bear an unnecessary burden of more than $400,000 because of the arbitrary and unwarranted course pursued by the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System. This large sum of money was voluntarily contributed by citizens of the United States who did so unselfishly and with no hope or prospect of receiving any pecuniary return therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses by the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System did not stop with merely refusing their chain facilities, but they have gone further, in attempting to prevent and in preventing privately owned radio stations from taking and broadcasting the programs of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The aforementioned broadcasting chain corporations deny interfering with privately owned stations and thus preventing them from broadcasting the chain programs of Jehovah’s witnesses. Evidence produced at the Congressional hearings in 1934 shows that such denials are not supported by the facts. See report of hearings on H. R. 7986, pages 94-97. Reference is also made to the testimony of Anton Koerber appearing in record of the hearing on H. R. 8301, beginning at page 299.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following quotation is taken from that record on pages 303 and 304:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;The National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System have a virtual monopoly of effective large-scale broadcasting in the United States. This is accomplished, first, by outright ownership of certain powerful broadcasting stations, and, secondly, by what is known as preferential time contracts with independently owned stations. These contracts provide that whenever demanded by either chain such independently owned stations are required to yield time to the chain. Such contracts are generally made in writing, but with the N. B. C. this monopolistic control is effected by means of a ‘general understanding’ as between the respective independently owned stations and N. B. C. This agreement is said by N. B. C. to be not in writing in most cases.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Additionally, the following is quoted from the same record on H. R. 8301, page 306:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A vice president of Columbia Broadcasting System, Henry Bellows, testified, March 20, 1934, before the House Radio Committee that substantially all C. B. S. stock is owned and controlled by the Paley family. Like the N. B. C., C. B. S. also maintains a self-established censorship, admittedly dictated by Henry Bellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In addition to stations owned by C. B. S. and its subsidiaries, it controls absolutely by contract most of the time of many independently owned stations. While its representative who testified before the House Radio Committee denied the existence of such control, the following excerpts from two contracts made by C. B. S. with a certain station are offered in evidence that such absolute control in fact exists:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘Agreement entered into by and between Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York (hereinafter called “Columbia”) and ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘ ... It is agreed that during the term of this contract the station will not permit the use of its facilities by any other broadcasting chain or network; and that it will not receive programs from or forward programs to any other station, group of stations, chain or network without the specific consent in writing of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘ ... It is agreed that during the term of this contract the station will not, without the specific consent in writing of Columbia, permit the use of its facilities by any other broadcasting chain or network; that without such consent it will not receive programs from or forward programs to any other station, group of stations, chain or network; and that without such consent it will not, directly or indirectly, through an agency, representative, or otherwise, sell its facilities for use along with the facilities of any other station or stations as a group.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“For consideration of the chairman of the committee, it is respectfully suggested that C. B. S. be required to file for information of the committee a copy of its contract with stations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Further upon this point we offer herewith the affidavit of A. R. Goux, marked Exhibit C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was the manifest intention of Congress, in enacting the radio law, that all radio facilities shall be used and operated in the interest of the public, and this is shown by the fact that the Radio Act repeatedly uses the terms “public convenience, interest and necessity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System, taking advantage of the provisions of the law, have builded mighty chain broadcasting organizations. The presumption therefore must be indulged that these broadcasting chain facilities are to be used for public convenience, interest and necessity, and that hence it is not the prerogative of a religious censor committee to determine what the people shall or shall not hear on matters pertaining to the Word of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In other words, a few prejudiced religionists are by the officials of the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System entrusted with the important duty of determining what the people shall or shall not hear on matters pertaining to the Scriptures, and this is done contrary to the letter and the spirit of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And now it appears that the high officials of the National Broadcasting Company and of the Columbia Broadcasting System have been and are working in conjunction with the managing director of the National Association of Broadcasters to impose upon independently owned stations, as far as possible, the recognition of the same improper rules and practices with respect to these matters that have been developed and followed by the two major chain broadcasting systems. In proof of this statement, reference is here made to the speech of Henry A. Bellows, delivered September 17, 1934, before the annual convention of the National Association of Broadcasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Permit me to remind this Commission that Congress and other public officials are the servants of the people and are obligated to serve the interests of the people and to protect them against the selfish machinations of individuals or groups of individuals who wish to use the radio facilities for private gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The policy of our opponents has been (and therefore we anticipate it will be here) to select an isolated sentence and quote it from our literature entirely out of its setting so as to make us appear ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If this is done this time and the Commission desires to have the whole facts, we shall be pleased to submit any literature from which the opponents may quote, that full opportunity may be had to examine the entire matter.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Hierarchy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">In 1933 the clergy, operating through their publications, and particularly Catholic newspapers, began an open, vigorous campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses; and in order to prevent the people from hearing the message of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and others employed threats and coercive and other improper means and influence to deter privately owned radio stations from taking and broadcasting programs of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By the term Catholic Hierarchy as here used is meant, not the rank and file of the Catholic system, but the ruling power or group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The abundant proof submitted to the House radio committee and the House commerce committee at the hearings aforementioned, and which is set forth in the printed record, establishes beyond all doubt that agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy used threats and coercion, expressed through various newspapers and other publications and various organized groups of their sympathizers, including the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the National Council of Catholic Men, the Knights of Columbus, and others, to compel many station owners to discontinue broadcasting AV a t c h Tower programs of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Additionally, it was proved conclusively that the Hierarchy’s official representative, Henry Caravati, acting by authority and with approval of several archbishops and bishops of the Hierarchy, directly conferred about stopping Watch Tower broadcasts with one then a member of the Federal Radio Commission, a zealous Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was further proved beyond any question that following that conference with the Catholic member of the Radio Commission, and for many weeks thereafter, agents of the Hierarchy by their publications openly led their readers in all parts of the country to believe that the nation-wide campaign of the Catholic Hierarchy to force all radio stations to discontinue broadcasting Watch Tower programs was approved by and carried on with the knowledge and consent of the Federal Radio Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Copies of such publications containing threats of boycott by agents of the Catholic Hierarchy were freely used in many parts of the country to coerce owners and managers of broadcasting stations and allied business enterprises. Such action was taken to enforce pressure upon those stations by means of organized letter writing and personal visits of individuals and groups spurred to act by direction of the Roman Catholic clergy. (See printed testimony, hearing on H. R. 7986, pages 35, 113-124. Also, hearing on H. R. 8301, pages 302, 303, 307-318.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a result of the nation-Avide opposition conducted by the organized clergy and the subsequent action of the members of the Federal Radio Commission in writing officially and specifically to hundreds of radio stations regarding the Watch Tower programs, many radio stations, induced by fear of losing their license, have broken their contracts with Jehovah’s witnesses and decline to further broadcast their programs until the matter shall be definitely settled by Congress or its duly constituted authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of this organized opposition to the message of Jehovah’s kingdom, and because the people are thus being deprived of their just rights and privileges, the aforementioned petition was circulated, signed and filed with Congress; and in support of that petition the evidence was offered at the two Congressional hearings already mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not content with its accomplishments up to the time of the Congressional hearings on this matter last spring, thereafter the Catholic Hierarchy through its official agents mutilated the official record, partially succeeding in destroying some of the proof presented to Congress. Obviously that was attempted to prevent members of Congress from identifying the Hierarchy’s agents and their conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As one example, mention is here made of the deliberate mutilation of certain evidence offered at the hearing on the Communications bill before the House commerce committee, and concerning which the clerk of that committee wrote to the Watch Tower representative at Washington. The clerk’s letter is here quoted, and a photostatic copy submitted herewith as Exhibit D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Committee on</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Interstate and Foreion Commerce Washington. D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">June 13, 1934. Mr. Anton Koerber,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1603</span><span class="font9"> Massachusetts Ave., N.W., Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">My dear Mr. Koerber:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reference is made to your inquiry regarding the Chart on page 309 of the hearings before the Committee on the Federal Communications Commission. The chart upon this page you state should show a letter “S”. I have checked this print with the original which was furnished by you, and which was sent to the Government Printing Office, and I note that the letter “S” on this chart was eliminated for some reason, it being plainly visible where the “S” was taken off the diagram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elton J. Layton</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Clerk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In explanation of the letter of Mr. Layton, the following statement is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the House hearing on the Communications bill a chart was offered in evidence for the purpose of showing the authoritative arrangement of the Catholic Hierarchy's organization and also to show that Mr. Henry Caravati was and is the executive agent of said religious organization and acting as executive secretary and business secretary of the National Council of Catholic Men; also that the said Caravati is the one who conducted the propaganda throughout the United States against the Watch Tower programs and how this was done by him by direction of the higher officials of the Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Said chart and an explanation thereof appear at pages 308 and 309 of the hearings on H. R. 8301. On page 309, in the chart there shown, immediately following and below the letter “Q” the letter “S” appeared on the chart as originally made. This letter “S” directly located Air. Caravati as the executive agent of the aforementioned Catholic organization and as the connecting link between the higher officials of the Catholic Hierarchy and the Catholic press and the Federal Radio Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After this chart had been offered in evidence, approved by the committee for publication and delivered to the custody of the clerk thereof, a prominent Catholic who had appeared before the committee called at the office of the clerk of the House commerce committee and asked to see the record including this chart and went over the whole record before it was passed to the Government printer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the chart was printed the aforesaid letter “S” did not appear as it had appeared on the original official record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In further support of this, a photostatic copy of the chart as originally placed in evidence is here now offered to be made a part of the record, marked Exhibit E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is also supported by the affidavit of Anton Koerber hereto attached and marked Exhibit F.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>World-wide Opposition</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">It is due this Commission and Congress that information be submitted that the opposition to the use of the radio by Jehovah’s witnesses is not confined to the United States. It is an opposition that extends throughout the nations of “Christendom”, and it is on such a gigantic scale and so intricately formed and carried on that it is manifest that it could not emanate from a human mind, but that it is the product of the supermind of Satan himself, whom the Lord Jesus denounces as a liar and the father of lies and says that those who follow the methods of Satan are Satan’s children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this connection we quote the words of Jesus addressed to the clergy in His day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;‘Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As to the facts in support of these assertions we submit the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past six years in the northern part of New Jersey alone and within the jurisdiction of the Catholic bishop of Trenton there have been arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses to the number of more than 700 men and women. These arrests have been upon charges of peddling and hawking and being disorderly persons because walking through the streets and refusing to disclose their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real facts are that the only “offensive” thing that these witnesses of Jehovah were doing was going about from house to house presenting the gospel of God’s kingdom to the people who were willing to hear, and in doing this they werg following the commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ and doing exactly as His apostles did, as stated in the Scriptures. (Matthew 10:12,13; Acts 20:20) Upon a hearing of these cases in the magistrates’ courts invariably a conviction resulted after a trial which was a farce and a disgrace to the judicial branch of the government. Upon appeal, the higher courts have held these convictions invalid and discharged the defendants and in many instances have held that the ordinances under which the arrests were made are inapplicable to such as Jehovah’s witnesses. Regardless of these decisions of the higher courts the police continue to make arrests of harmless men and women for preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a number of instances where the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey has held ordinances inapplicable to Jehovah’s witnesses, the law-making bodies of certain cities, towns and villages, yielding to the improper influence of religious leaders, have declared their purpose to enact and have enacted ordinances for the express purpose of preventing Jehovah’s witnesses from carrying on their work of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only certain specially selected police officers are sent out to make these arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the statement has been made repeatedly by policemen that these specially selected officers are acting under the direction of the clergy who are back of all this persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the hearings before the Congressional committees in the early part of 1934, Catholic newspapers have continued their assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Catholic stronghold of Quebec there has been open persecution, arrest and prosecution of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Australia, where Jehovah’s witnesses have been using thirty-odd radio stations for some time, the Catholic press, at the instance of the clergy, have carried on a constant campaign of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Freeman’s Journal,</span><span class="font9"> published and copyrighted throughout Australia, the following appeared on June 21,1934:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ . . . What authority have these people? None whatever. God never invited them to be His witnesses, nor did He give them such a ridiculous message. Judge Rutherford’s authority as an exponent of Scripture is nil. He betrays no sound scholarship whatever; knows nothing of any real principles of interpretation; and violates all logic and reason in the outpourings of his warped imagination. Is the movement harmful or otherwise? It is harmful from almost every point of view. It is not in the least constructive. It is destructive, not only of Christianity, but of all lawful civil authority. There has been a lot of trouble in America over the broadcasted utterances of Judge Rutherford. The Radio Stations refused to hand his matter, and the Witnesses of Jehovah protested to the Radio Commission that, even though they were ready to pay for time, the Stations would not sell it to them. The case went to Congress in March last, and the McFadden bill was introduced in their favor. The Witnesses of Jehovah handed in petitions signed by 2,500,000 persons. But it was shown that the signatures were obtained under false pretences, that many were frank forgeries, and others the names of mere children. The McFadden bill, in favor of Rutherford, was defeated in Congress, and American Stations were justified in their refusal to waste people’s time with the anti-political, anti-Christian, and insulting propaganda of Judge Rutherford. Thus you have the trend, gist, authority, and harmful character of Judge Rutherford’s organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The foregoing is a sample of the mass of material which has emanated from the Catholic Hierarchy’s business headquarters in Washington, D.C., known as the National Catholic Welfare Conference, and which has been published under the Hierarchy’s supervision in hundreds of newspapers in the United States and other countries. The page from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Freeman’s Journal</span><span class="font9"> containing the statement just quoted is offered herewith for the record, and marked Exhibit G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This shows that the press is either woefully misinformed or willfully given to misrepresentation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the last session of the New Jersey legislature, in the Assembly there was introduced by an ardent Knight of Columbus a bill which, if enacted into law, would prevent any person from making any speech or conunent within the state (regardless of whether that speech were true or false), criticizing any religion or that might have the tendency to hold up any religion or religious group to ridicule and contempt; and also would prohibit the use of radio stations, transcription machines, phonographs or any other means of conveying such message, and would make it a criminal offense for anyone to rent a hall to any person or group of persons to be used for such public address, either by a person or by any mechanical instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This bill was quietly enacted in the Assembly, and when it came before the Senate the whole scheme was exposed and the bill died there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In proof we submit herewith for the record a copy of a statement filed with the New Jersey Senate by Charles R. Hessler on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, entitled “Protest”, marked Exhibit H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Manifestly the object of this proposed legislation was to prevent information in any form from reaching the people, unless the same was first approved by the clergymen of certain religious organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A proclamation was made by the Catholic Hierarchy that the year 1933 was a “holy year” during which prayers were made for peace and prosperity. That having failed, then the Catholic St. Joseph’s Guild, on June 30,1934, issued a call for a nation-wide prayer meeting to be engaged in by various religionists and the distinguished men of America, for peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses distributed a small leaflet announcing that a radio lecture would be delivered and broadcast on August 12, 1934, the purpose of which lecture was to inform the people as to the Bible teaching of and concerning public prayers for peace and prosperity. For the “heinous” offense of inviting the people to hear that lecture and subsequently for distributing free copies of such lecture, many of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and thrown into jail at the instance of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is cited for the purpose of showing the studied effort to prevent the people from hearing the truth by means of radio and that this opposition to the truth is led by the clergy and is in keeping with their effort to influence this government to prevent anyone from using the radio except by the consent of “organized religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In France during the year 1933 the president of the Peoples Pulpit Association and its associate organizations was advertised to deliver certain public addresses over a chain of radio stations, the speech originating at station Poste Pabisien, Paris. A number of Catholics freely stated that they had been advised by the papal Hierarchy not to listen to such lectures and furthermore an attempt was made to have the radio stations cancel the contract for such broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A volume of evidence along this same line might well be submitted, but this is deemed sufficient to show that the opposition to the proclamation of the message of God’s Word by Jehovah’s witnesses emanates from Jehovah’s great adversary, Satan, who opposed Christ Jesus when He was on earth and who has opposed every effort to proclaim the truth since. Said Jesus to His followers who are Jehovah’s witnesses: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The method of that great adversary, Satan the Devil, is to employ fraud and deceit to mislead the people, and in doing so he has blinded and misled millions of persons of good intent. Without a question of doubt organizations such fts Fascists, Nazi, communists, are all carried forward at the instance and under the immediate direction of the organization of Jesuits, which organization is the secret service department of the Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The provision of the American Constitution relating to freedom of religion and freedom of speech has enabled this mighty organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to expand its activities politically and otherwise to an extent not possible in a land of less freedom. That mighty institution has laid hold of the accouterments of freedom for its own ends and has flourished. It is not surprising in this day to see that this organization turns against the very arrangement or provision of freedom that enabled it to grow in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now it comes into the open and displays itself as the deadly foe of truth, equality and liberty, and employs threats and coercion to prevent the people from hearing what they are entitled to hear. It deems itself sufficiently entrenched now to show itself in its true colors and to begin to impose its will on the vast majority of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let it be distinctly understood that by no means do all Catholics find themselves in accord with the policies, activities and objectives of the Hierarchy, which arrogates to itself the power to rule them. The Hierarchy’s worldwide organization is in fact controlled and operated from a country foreign to America and where the fundamental principles of the American government are entirely ignored. Millions of good, honest Catholic people residing in the United States are not at all in sympathy with the coercive and boycott and other oppressive methods used by the Catholic Hierarchy to keep the people in ignorance of the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all this opposition the Catholic clergy are ably supported by the Protestant and Hebrew clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses desire to be clearly and distinctly understood that they have no controversy with clergymen as men. Each and every clergyman ought to have the right to worship his god and to practice his religion as the Constitution of the United States provides. These have no right, however, to act as censors of the speech or message of others noi’ to determine what the people may or may not hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Other citizens of the United States who do not believe that these gentlemen who are designated clergymen are pursuing the right course should also have the privilege of exercising their God-given rights to worship Jehovah God and serve Him and His kingdom and to make known the truths concerning the same to other people who want to hear. If such a rule is not invoked and followed in the United States, then this country ceases to be a nation of freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The practice of preventing or trying to prevent anyone from expressing his honest convictions is entirely contrary to God and His truth and righteousness. God does not attempt at any time to prevent any creature from freely expressing himself. Had God exercised His power to so prevent freedom of expression and activity, the Devil would never have been permitted to carry on as he has for thousands of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Concerning Satan, the adversary, Jehovah said: Tor this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power’; and in order that my witnesses may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.’—Exodus 9: 1G, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time has now arrived when God commands His witnesses to go forth amongst the people and declare to them that He, Jehovah, is the Almighty God, and this commandment they must obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The great issue before mankind now is, Who shall control the world, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? Because we have reached the time of the settlement of this final issue, every creature of “Christendom” is required to take his stand either on the side of the Devil or on the side of Jehovah God. In order to intelligently place themselves on one side or the other, the people must have information and knowledge. It is the expressed will and command of Jehovah that His witnesses must bring this knowledge to the attention of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How can the people obtain this information unless someone tells them? Appropriate hereto are the words of the Scriptures recorded at Romans 10:14,15, which read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since this matter has been brought before Congress and this Commission a serious obligation rests upon each one having to do therewith. It is my duty and obligation, therefore, to say to this Commission that each one of you must take the responsibility before God of choosing one side or the other of this question at issue : that is, to favor the open and free discussion of matters of such vital importance to the people as that contained in the Bible, and therefore to take your stand on Jehovah’s side; or, to favor the suppression of freedom of expression and thereby keep the people in ignorance of the truth and so align yourselves on the side of God’s enemy, Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The highest executive officer of the United States, in his inaugural address, with propriety quoted from the Bible the following text, to wit: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” —Proverbs 29:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people can have no vision or understanding of God's gracious provision for them unless they receive information and knowledge concerning the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses have entered into a solemn agreement with the Most High God to do His will, and upon them is laid the duty and obligation to bear this information to the people and call it to their attention. A failure or refusal on the part of such witnesses to bring this information to the attention of the people in obedience to God’s commandment would mean their own annihilation.—Matthew 24:14; Isaiah 43:10-12; Acts 3: 20-23; Ezekiel 3:17-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The influence of big religionists has precluded the newspapers from publishing the truth concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom. The radio is the only means left whereby the American people can have the full opportunity to hear the whole truth relative to any matter; hence Jehovah’s witnesses must make an effort to carry this information to the people by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Appropriate hereto the following timely words are quoted from a recent speech of Hon. C. C. Dill, senator for the State of Washington:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The public interest demands that radio stations give news to their listeners in order that the people may know’ the truth, the w’hole truth, regarding public controversies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The abuse of the right of free press by the great newspapers . . . has destroyed the confidence of the masses of the people in the press in many parts of the country. They doubt that they are getting the full truth about controversial matters. They deplore their inability to get both sides, and in many communities the support of certain newspapers for any cause even does that cause more harm than good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The American system is the only one by which freedom of speech by radio can be compelled. There is no freedom of speech by radio in Germany, Italy and Russia. Even in democratic England, in free France, and in liberty-loving Denmark, there is no freedom of speech by radio for the discussion of public questions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In view of the facts we, as Jehovah’s witnesses, could not consistently come here and ask that we be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">permitted</span><span class="font9"> to use the radio facilities to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom; but in the name of Jehovah God and in the interest of righteous-minded and free people we can and do consistently demand that a fair and equal opportunity to use the radio facilities be accorded to all persons or organizations and that there be no discrimination shown; and that no one shall be permitted to directly or indirectly interfere with the proper use thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Having in mind the character of the organizations and the men that have wrongfully interfered with the use of radio facilities in the United States and other places, and judging the immediate future by the past, I am certain that the un-American and ungodly methods of interference will continue to be employed by organized religionists and others to prevent the free and proper use of the radio, unless Congress takes some positive action to prevent the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the matter has come before Congress and before this Commission, the questions are, Will the law-making branch of the American government wink at such improper interference and permit a group of religionists and other entrenched selfish interests to continue to exercise wrongful influence over the owners of radio stations and to deprive commercial radio stations of the privilege of earning a legitimate revenue, and at the same time prevent the American people from hearing and receiving proper information concerning matters of vital importance to them, or will Congress use its proper powers to safeguard the interests of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shall the lawmakers of the nation yield to the demands of selfish men, or shall they give heed to the commandment of Almighty God and permit the people to now have a fair opportunity to receive a knowledge of His truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the government has undertaken to regulate radio broadcasting, manifestly there should be some change in the law concerning broadcasting facilities and the manner of using the same, and this change should be made in the interest of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By law Congress should provide that no person, group of persons, corporation or company shall either directly or indirectly interfere with or attempt to interfere with the owner or operator of any radio station in entering into contract or contracts with other persons looking to the broadcasting of their radio programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By law Congress should prevent the use of threats, boycott or other means of coercion by providing for adequate punishment of offenders. American citizens should not have their liberties curtailed by any group of persons, and particularly when that group is directed by a foreign power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Furthermore, persons, groups of persons, companies or corporations should not be permitted to arbitrarily determine that nothing shall be broadcast concerning the Bible until the text thereof first receives the approval of a board of censors made up of clergymen. Censorship is un-American and, above all, ungodly, and hence unrighteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Religionists should not be denied an opportunity to express their views by means of radio, nor should they be permitted to interfere with others’ expressing themselves. Let all have a fair and equal show. If any group of persons is willing to contract and pay money for the use of radio facilities to broadcast its programs, and radio stations are willing to contract and undertake the broadcasting of such programs, then certainly no group of persons or organizations should have any right to interfere and should not be permitted to interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the government has undertaken to regulate the use of broadcasting facilities for the benefit of the people, it should provide:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(1) That all organizations have an equal opportunity to employ the use of the radio and that none be excluded by reason of the views they hold.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(2) That every organization be free to give expression to its views without being subjected to censorship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(3) That it be made a criminal offense, punishable by heavy fine and imprisonment, for any person, corporation, or other organization to willfully attempt to use or to actually use boycott, threats or other coercive measures to prevent a radio station from contracting with others for any programs or receiving and broadcasting any such programs; but that every radio station be left free to contract with anyone who is willing to meet its terms and pay for the use of facilities.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Importance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Why is the message now being delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses of such great importance to the people? With calmness and sobriety of mind, with malice toward none, and with knowledge based upon the plain and infallible Word of Jehovah God, and which is now fully supported by the physical facts well known to all persons who think, I make the following statement without expectation of successful contradiction and with the absolute certainty that the same is true, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the world is face to face with the greatest tribulation that has ever afflicted humankind. All the floods that have ever swept over the earth; all the disasters that have befallen mankind, resulting from earthquakes, cyclones, fires, famines, pestilence and war, all added together, will not equal the dreadful disaster that soon shall befall the nations of “Christendom’’. In the language of Jesus Christ, the greatest teacher that was ever on earth, that will be a time of tribulation such as the world has never known, and no, there shall never be another like it. At the conclusion of that tribulation there will be so many dead on the earth that the survivors will not be able to bury them. —Matthew 24:21; Jeremiah 25: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And why should such a great disaster come upon the world? Because Satan the Devil, in making his last and desperate attempt to determine the issue of supremacy in his favor, is gathering all nations to the battle of Armageddon, and all who side with Satan will perish in that conflict. The time is at hand when this great issue of supremacy must be settled. It will be settled by the armies of Jehovah God completely wrecking and destroying Satan’s organization, both visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this terrible trouble that is just ahead there is but one possible way for men to escape, and that way is plainly pointed out in the Bible, the Word of God, and at no other place. If a great hurricane were sweeping up the Atlantic coast, notice and information thereof would be flashed to every village, town and city along the way, and anyone who would cut the wires to prevent such message of truth from reaching the people would be denounced as a wicked criminal and subjected to severe punishment. It is of far greater importance that the peoples of the earth now be informed as to what the Word of God says about the approaching world trouble and the only way of escape. If, after receiving the information, anyone chooses to disregard the same, that is his responsibility. But woe unto the man, men or organizations that now attempt to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. God’s great adversary, and who is the worst enemy of all men, namely, Satan the Devil, is the one using his agencies to keep the people in ignorance of what they so much need to know and understand. This Commission and the Congress to which its report must be made are charged with a grave responsibility toward mankind and before Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The matters here for consideration involve the vital interest of millions of people. Above all, they involve the name of Jehovah God, the creator of radio. They should be determined without reference to fear of men, and with a sincere desire to do good unto all men as opportunity is afforded. Above all, the conclusions should give due credit and honor to the name of Jehovah God and to His kingdom.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Pope Attacks “Heresy”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">J</span><span class="font9">UST in case you are a “heretic” whose “heresies” need ‘stamping out’; perhaps a little study of the Associated Press clipping below might be enlightening. A heretic in this case is one who does not believe that God and Christ ever appointed anyone “pope” to rule this world, and who holds and teaches doctrines other than that which popes hold and teach; for example, Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cites Era of Inquisition in Letter to Dominicans</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican City, March 10 (AP).—Pope Pius today exhorted the Order of Dominicans throughout the world to rally to the standard of St. Dominie and drive out heresy. His exhortation was included in an apostolic letter commemorating the seventh centenary of Dominic’s canonization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He recalled the Era of the Inquisition and urged modern Dominicans to “follow the example of the founder”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That last paragraph is very interesting, and should be examined carefully. “He recalled the Era of the Inquisition and urged modern Dominicans to ‘follow the example of the founder’.” We may also recall with profit that “Era” and ‘the example of Dominic’, thereby judging what to expect from modern Dominicans and others. An excerpt from Dominic’s last sermon in Languedoc, southern France, after failing to “convert” the poor people of that region to support the pope and his corrupt organization, will reveal “the example”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“For many years I have exhorted you in vain, with gentleness, preaching, praying and weeping. But according to the proverb of my country, ‘Where blessing can accomplish nothing, blows may avail.’ We shall rouse against you princes and prelates, who, alas, will arm nations and kingdoms against this land . . . and thus blows will avail where blessings and gentleness have been powerless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">True to the spirit that animated that speech, the forces of the pope drenched that land with blood in a horrible civil war in which all France wms involved, the papal north subjecting the south to the domination of the popes. Part of the “subjecting machinery” in finally stamping out all opposition was the tribunal of the Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Inquisition. The name given to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction dealing with the detection and punishment of heretics and all persons guilty of any offense against Catholic orthodoxy. The following information is according</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Fred Slaughter (Neiv Jersey) </span><span class="font9">to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font9"> Vol. VIII, pages 30-34:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Inquisitor. A special but permanent judge, acting in the name of the pope and clothed by him with the right and the duty to deal legally with offenses against the faith. Chosen especially from the Order of Dominicans. “Where they sat, there was the Inquisition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Procedure. The inquisitor, on coming to a heresy-ridden district, summoned the inhabitants together, and if any of them confessed of their own free will a suitable penance was imposed, that is, a pilgrimage. This (the confessing of the penitents) pointed out proper quarters for investigation, and much evidence was obtained against individuals this way. These were cited before the judges, usually by the parish priest, and the trial began. If the testimony was incriminating and the accused denied he was a heretic (for fear, etc.), four methods were used to extract a confession from him:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(1) Fear of death; that is, by giving the accused to understand that the stake awaited him if he would not confess.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(2) More or less confinement, possibly emphasized by a curtailment of food.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(3) Visits of tried men, who would attempt to induce free confession through friendly persuasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(4) Torture.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Witnesses. Names of witnesses were generally withheld. Witnesses for the defense never appeared, because of fear. There was no personal confrontation of witnesses; neither was there any cross-examination. No lawyers could defend them, by order of Innocent III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Punishments. Torture was authorized by Innocent IV and others and was used as a means of obtaining a “confession” from the so-called “heretic”. The punishments administered by the civil authorities, as outlined by the inquisitor, in serious cases was burning at the stake, or perpetual incarceration in prisons, the best of which were rotten. “In some cells the unfortunates wore bound in stocks, unable to move about, and forced to sleep on the ground. There was little regard for cleanliness, and in some cases there was no light or ventilation, and the food was meagre and very poor.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{Cath. Encyc.,</span><span class="font9"> Vol. VIII, page 32) In connection with burning at the stake Innocent IV said, “When those adjudged guilty of heresy have</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">been given up to the civil power by the bishops or his representative, or the Inquisition, the podesta or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once, and shall within five days, at the most, execute the laws made against them. This papal bull “ad exstirpanda” referring to burning at the stake of the impenitent heretics was made thereafter a fundamental document of the Inquisition, renewed and enforced by several popes: Alexander IV, Clement IV, Nicholas IV, Boniface VIII, and others. The civil authorities themselves, if they did not obey, were excommunicated, and thereby became “heretics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Final Verdict. The ultimate decision (of the Inquisition) was pronounced with solemn ceremony. Two days before, those concerned had the charges read to them, and later were told where to appear to hear the verdict. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermo,</span><span class="font9"> a short discourse, began early in the morning; then followed swearing in the officials, who were made to vow obedience to the inquisitor in all things pertaining to suppression of heresy. Then regularly followed the “decrees of mercy” or statements concerning previous remittances of penalties, and finally the due punishments were pronounced, after their offenses had been again enumerated. The punishments announced started with minor judgments and proceeded up to the most severe perpetual imprisonment or death. Thereupon the “guilty” were turned over to the civil power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“With Ecclesiastical Approbation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">H</span><span class="font9">ERE is a little four-page folder, printed by the P. A. Kemper Co., Dayton, Ohio, and marked “With Ecclesiastical Approbation”. It came in an envelope with other material advertising the business of Reverend Father Francis Smyth, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church, Barnes-boro, Pa. Probably the folder has his approbation, and so we examine it with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The interior of the folder and the back page are full of spiritual exercises, 300 days for this and 300 days for that, and 7 years and 7 quarantines for this and 7 years and 7 quarantines for that; all together, 14 years, 14 quarantines and 900 days for going over these matters just once. There are 40 days in a quarantine; so the thing figures out (at 365J days to the year) at just 18 years, lacking one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The front page shows where the 18 years apply. It contains a picture of a bake-oven, apparently lined with fire-brick, and divided into four compartments, in each of which sinners are being baked. Up one side of the picture the ones that got out of purgatory are shown going up to heaven. Through the four windows, or tuyeres, one can see five persons in the flames. They are shown dressed and tearing their hair; so it seems that the flames for some reason do not burn either their clothing or their hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, after a good many hundreds or thousands of years they get out, one by one. The angels come for them one at a time to take them to heaven. Two men and one woman are shown being escorted up to heaven. The men are the first and the last, with the woman in between. Men angels come for men, and women angels for women. At the top is a picture of two angels acting as a reception committee, and a picture of the deity with the head not shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whole main center of the picture is taken up by a priest in full regalia. He is standing on top of the oven. An altar boy is lifting his skirts while he is holding aloft the glass of wine which, in a few moments, he expects to pour down his neck. The suggestion is made that every dollar he gets which is not spent for wine is divided with the angels that take the souls out of “purgatory”; but it seems as if they would all be in better business if they let the fires go out and did by the poor sinners and the long suffering and badly stung public as they would like to be done by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all innocence we showed the foregoing effort to a young Italian clerk, and within a few minutes he handed in the following. Probably he wants us to give it “ecclesiastical approbation” ; but nothing doing. The Italians are up to too many tricks already; however, we print it, for what it is worth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">the series of five-minute talks by Judge Rutherford is continued. Misconceptions attached to the word “holy” are clearly pointed out. The importance of this subject cannot be overstated, and a careful study of this and other talks in the series will prove of inestimable benefit to the earnest seeker for the truth. The talks deal with fundamental issues and teachings of the Bible and show the bearing these have upon the people today, and enable them to pursue a wise course in this time of stress.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Holy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE WORD “holy” has been grossly misused, and thereby many persons have been deceived. “Holy” means that which is complete, pure, without fault, and entirely devoted to righteousness. Jehovah God is the Holy One, because He is complete, pure, without fault, and entirely devoted to righteousness. The Scriptures, at Psalm 99:5, say: ‘Worship Jehovah, for he is holy.’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font9"> Anything that is out of harmony with Jehovah is unholy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan, the Devil, is the wicked one, is entirely out of harmony with Jehovah God, and is unholy. Everything that is of Satan’s organization is unholy. The Scriptures declare that Satan, the Devil, is the invisible ruler of this world and that the world is under his control. (2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 John 5:19) “The world” means the organization of the peoples of earth under the supervision of the invisible overlord the Devil. The only way for a person or thing to become holy is to be entirely separate from Satan’s organization, or world, and be entirely devoted to God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Catholic church organization is ruled by a few men, which body is called the “Catholic hierarchy”. There are millions of persons who are subject to that hierarchy but who have nothing to do with ruling the Catholic church organization. Those millions of Catholics desire the truth, but have been kept in darkness by their rulers. My purpose is not to offend anyone who is a Catholic by this statement, but it is to speak the truth from God’s Word that others may be informed. No man or company of men has the power to make anything holy by so declaring. The proclamation of the pope declaring 1933 a “holy year” was made without authority; and hence the year was not holy, nor did it bring peace and prosperity to the people, and everyone knows that fact now. The Catholic hierarchy is not holy, for the reason, it is not devoted to God and His kingdom. It participates in the political affairs of this world, and hence is a part of the world, and the friend of the world; and the Scriptures, at James 4:4, say that this world is God’s enemy. Therefore, the Catholic organization serves the Devil, and not Jehovah. The pope now acknowledges that his “holy year” proclamation has failed to bring peace and prosperity, and in his alarm he calls upon all the people to pray that Armageddon may be averted. But his prayers in this behalf will also fail, because Jehovah God has declared that the battle of Armageddon shall destroy all worldly organizations to make way for God’s holy kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No good could result to the people by continuing to support an organization that is out of harmony with God and His kingdom. What the people must now do is to get on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom, regardless of what your religious affiliations may have been. If you would have God’s approval and escape the great tribulation of Armageddon and receive the blessings of His kingdom you must devote yourself to Jehovah, which means to be entirely separate from all human organizations. It is written, in 1 Peter 1:16: ‘Be ye holy, saith Jehovah, for I am holy.’ You cannot be holy unless you separate yourselves from unholy organizations; and this is plainly declared in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font9"> Corinthians 6:14-18. You must study the Bible and find out for yourself what is the right way. Do not follow the teachings of men, because all men are imperfect and their teachings are imperfect, regardless of their good intentions. Follow the teachings of God’s Word. Books are now available which show how to study the Bible and how you can inform yourselves and learn what is the right way to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">go.</span><span class="font9"> The failure of the so-called “holy year” ought to be sufficient to open your eyes to the fact that doctrines taught by men cannot be relied upon unless those doctrines are entirely supported by God’s Word. And this you can determine only by gaining a knowledge of the truth as set forth in the Bible. Your self-interest demands that you learn the truth and follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the kingdom under Christ there will be no rival organizations; because everything must be in harmony with that kingdom, and therefore must be wholly devoted to righteousness. All opposing organizations will be gone and the people will be devoted to God and His righteousness. Then the people will enjoy everlasting peace and unbroken prosperity. Those who then try to do right and render themselves in obedience to God’s kingdom will live for ever in peace and happiness. In this time of world distress it is of the greatest importance that you know the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The goat is the healthiest domestic animal known. Goat milk is superior in every way to cow’s milk. Goat milk is the ideal food for babies, convalescents and invalids, especially those with weakened digestive powers. Goat milk is the purest, most healthful and most complete food known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the beginning, since earliest times, the goat has functioned continuously as the producer of nature’s finest and most nearly perfect food for man. Biblical history is replete with tales of ancient people and their dependency upon the goat for sustenance. One fine reference is made in Proverbs 27: 27: “Thou shalthave goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The physical evidence of years, manifested in these peoples relying upon the goat for milk, is more substantiated by our modern scientists and physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How easy it is to keep your internal machine in good condition and to feel fit and fine, through use of pure goats’ milk—nature’s most easily digested food, with alkaline reaction on the stomach, which heals! Goat milk contains chlorine, a purifier for the system, and in every drop is potassium, which has greatest affinity for oxygen, to pep up life to the limit. It is rich in iron, but not too rich in butterfat; and contains more vitamins than any other food known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goat milk is (1) alkaline in reaction, (2) rich in mineral salts, (3) digested in twenty minutes, and (4) a laxative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goat milk is ideal for anemia, nervousness, loss of weight, run-down condition, constipation, tuberculosis, ulcerated stomach, nervous indigestion, babies, pernicious anemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">why goats’ milk is nature’s ideal food </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR OLD AND YOUNG, SICK AND WELL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DIGESTIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goats’ milk digests in twenty minutes, whereas it takes cows’ milk from two to three hours. Goat milk is destined by nature to nourish a little kid that weighs at birth 6 pounds, which is the average weight of a human baby. Cow’s milk is destined to nourish a calf that weighs 45 pounds at birth. The fat globules in goat milk are in more perfect emulsion and do not rise as rapidly as cream in cows’ milk, and so goat milk digests in twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BUTTERFAT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Contrary to general belief, goats’ milk is not richer in butterfat than cows’ milk, but it is richer in the vital mineral salts that are necessary to life. The butterfat test of a herd is just 3.5, which is city ordinance requirements for Grade A milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">STOMACH REACTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goats’ milk has an alkaline reaction on the stomach, whereas cows’ milk has an acid reaction. Goats’ milk contains much magnesium (the digestive chemical), which is the same mineral used in milk of magnesia, the principal medicine for stomach disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">VITAMINS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goats’ milk contains more vitamins than any other food known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE STORY IN A NUTSHELL!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So it is no wonder that goats’ milk is recognized by the world’s greatest physicians and dietitians. It is so easy to digest; will heal poor ulcerated stomachs with its alkaline reaction. It contains calcium, the bone builder; silicon, the immunizer against tuberculosis; fluorin, the protector; and chlorin, the perfect germicide. In every drop of goats’ milk is a little oxygen tank in the form of potassium, to pep up life. The iron content builds up red blood corpuscles; and goats’ milk contains more vitamins than any other food known, and is a laxative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IT’S DIFFERENT !</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you went to your druggist and asked him what tonic or bitter he could furnish you in form of herbs, he would most likely tell you he had sassafras, burdock, dandelion, yarrow, dock, elder, blackberry, etc. Leaves, barks and various kinds of herbs are the things goats crave, and this is one reason there is so much medicinal value in goats’ milk. It is needless to say that milk of any animal is produced from the food it eats; and since goats prefer to eat these leaves and herbs, it is reasonable to suppose that the dairy goat furnishes all these in correct proportion for the human system, done up in one package in the form of goats’ milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Diabetes </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By William Held, M.D. (Illinois) </span><span class="font8">[Reprinted from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Western Medical</span><span class="font8"> Times]</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">N</span><span class="font9">O, SIR, I am not going to contribute another long article to the countless treatises of insulin that have crowded upon one another. I wish to dispose of that item of my remarks by pointing out that we are witnessing now a sort of reaction, a period of readjustment during which the unduly hopeful diabetic realizes that insulin (as Banting stated from the start) is not a curative substance; that its successful administration can only serve to decrease the sugar percentage of the blood and increase the sugar tolerance; in other words, that administration of insulin docs in no way coax the patient's pancreas to resume its sugar-splitting work, but that insulin does the splitting </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font9"> the malfunctioning pancreas. Therefore it is not a cure. Moreover, the administration of insulin (which, by the way, was known years before Banting made its application practical—see Stedman’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Med. Dictionary</span><span class="font9"> 1916) has its drawbacks, as, for instance, the necessity of frequent blood analysis to prevent overdoses, which by depriving the blood of its normal sugar contents would be fatal, and the fact that administration requires hypodermic injections several times a day, needle work which naturally has its limitations. The surgeon general at Madras (as well as many others) called attention to the dangers of insulin administration and pleads for scientific application. While all medication should be scientific, yet most remedies do not require so great precaution at the penalty of so dire results. During the time elapsed between the work of Langerhans (the pioneer of insulin research) and Banting, little practical work has been done. It seems that research men are determined not to permit such long lapse of inactivity to be repeated, as indicated by the fact that a long list of substances destined to replace insulin have already been isolated from vegetables, fish, yeast and glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The tendency of today, forced upon us by observation of clinical evidence, is to regard failure of a single gland to supply its specific ferments as only indicating that the entire glandular system is involved. The soundness of this opinion is very apparent when we remember the inter- and co-relationship existing between the individual members of the glandular chain, and, further, by the observation of certain phenomena which I shall mention directly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Conditions like goitre, cretinism and myxedema, for instance, cause us to think of the thyroid, diabetes of the pancreas, impotence of the sex glands, and so on. In directing our attention to the specific glands, the functions of which in our mind are intimately related with the symptomatology of these patients, we are still only thinking of the most </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">prominently</span><span class="font9"> affected, and not necessarily of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">solely</span><span class="font9"> responsible gland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Failure of a member of the glandular family causes disruption or participation in the disturbance of the entire family. Mayo, of Rochester, recently (in St. Louis) spoke of a chemical which he thought would replace thyroid deficiency to the end that youthful appearance of the aged might be retained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This merely means that such chemical would possess the characteristic to supply elements which could enable the crippled thyroid (deprived of these elements) to resume normal function or to supply the system with chemical elements replacing the missing thyroid substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We must be prepared to have old and ingrained opinions and maxims which we imbibed in our college days rudely shaken. But we shall be repaid by seeing in the place of antiquated theories not only newer but demonstrable facts installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To return to our subject of diabetes. The hypo-function of the pancreas is universally accepted as the cause of diabetes. This contention has been arrived at by virtue of chemical and physiological experiments, extirpation and transplantation in dogs, and by supplying the specific sugar-splitting ferments of the pancreas (from islands of Langerhans) to diabetics. Having thereby increased the sugar tolerance and decreased the glycosuria, the etiology on the side of the pancreas was strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Doubtless the pancreas, in developed cases of diabetes, is the gland at fault, but there is evidence to the effect that the pancreas is not the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">chief</span><span class="font9"> offender, stamping it only an “accessory to the fact”. If it is true that the pancreas, or any gland which shows unmistakable signs of guilt, is only the brunt-bearer of other glands’ offenses of omission (failure to secrete properly), then we ought to be able to “get at the pancreas” via such other glands. In other words, we ought to strike at other glands and mean the pancreas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lanta in Minerva Medicale reports the use of a serum prepared from pituitary substance, which when administered to diabetics proved successful in forty percent of treated cases to reduce sugar percentage and increase sugar tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In similar manner I have treated diabetics with glandular elements which were combined on the basis of such patients’ history and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">without</span><span class="font9"> the use of pancreas substance. The idea was to “hit at faulty glands” which in turn were to affect the pancreas. To the combination of gland substances (arrived at by carefully noting symptoms indicating which gland was hypo-functioning) ordinary yeast was added. In one case administration was per mouth. A urinalysis was made once a week, the patient herself going to a different laboratory each time. Each analysis showed a decreased glycosuria over the preceding week. During the four weeks of treatment, capsules were given three times per day and the diet regulated. After one month’s treatment the urine was sugar free, treatment was discontinued, and ordinary diet permitted. Ten weeks later, without any treatment, a urinalysis showed sugar free. I am well aware of the objections to which this result is open, that this was a case of glycosuria without pancreatic involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I forego to cite detailed symptoms of this case which entitle me to consider it one of genuine diabetes, and will, instead, rest my case on the results obtained in the treatment of another case to be cited. Remember that my contention is that readjustment of glandular harmony, detoxication, establishment of lost rhythm, will involve even such glands whose specific elements are not a part of the administered gland substances and that failure of one results in disharmony of other glands. The next case was that of a chronic diabetic, a man whom I have known for many years. This patient had first a toe and later the entire leg amputated. (Diabetic gangrene.) This patient for years had a urinalysis made once a day, which never failed to show the sugar contents, which the patient, by diet, attempted to hold low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Taking a careful survey of all the symptoms aside from those characteristic of diabetes, the indicated glandular material was prepared, using fresh glands and subjecting the same to a fermentation process. This material was placed in a large gelatine capsule, such as used by veterinarians, and was inserted into the rectum before retiring at night. The urinalysis next day revealed a sugar-free urine. True, the sugar was again evident the following day, still the results suggest that the treatment sufficed, temporarily at least, to stimulate faulty glands or to split sugar, no doubt due to ferments which were either set free in the patient’s economy or were supplied by the substances administered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Comparison of results obtained and the absolute harmlessness of the procedure with more drastic methods, invites more attention to “nonspecific” glandular therapy in diabetes and other conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such and similar experience tends to make us skeptical as to the sole responsibility of the pancreas as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> etiological factor in diabetes. I lean to the opinion that future events will prove that the pancreas is merely one of the links in a chain of implicated glands. I am not prepared to say that the pancreas is the primary cause; it may well be the most prominent or conspicuous member of the glandular system </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font9"> having been drawn into the vicious cycle of glandular upheaval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Having been intimately connected with this work I am well aware that some of the ideas expounded here will shock some of my staid brother practitioners, but this will not greatly chagrin me. I remember the words of Abder-halden, whom I am proud to count amongst my instructors, who said, with reference to the attitude of skeptics and antagonists: “This must not deter one to attack the most daring problems.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The idea of ascribing minor importance to the pancreas in diabetes appears less startling and iconoclastic when we consider that even the time-honored etiology of Graves’ disease has been attacked by Dr. Liek of Danzig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The deeply rooted belief that the thyroid is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> gland at fault in Graves’ disease is being shaken by Liek’s investigation. He says: “There is no disturbance of the thyroid, but rather a disturbance of the entire endocrine system, including the central nervous system.” From all this it appears that, as said before, disharmony of any gland may constitute the primary cause which later involves other members. The chief cause of glandular sluggishness is doubtless toxic infiltration. The toxic etiology of goitre has been mentioned by many authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the toxic etiology in mind we can easily understand why therapy directed to glands remote from the seat of a prominently pathologically affected gland, and administration of non-specific glandular material, has given good results. The answer is in the detoxination of the blood, the freeing of the glandular tissue from the grip of toxins which prevent their normal function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That glandular disharmony produces autointoxication of the entire system, ranging in effect from discomfort to death, needs no renewed proof. All know the result of renal, hepatic, ovarian, gastric, prostatic and other glandular disfunctioning. And that detoxination affords the means to revive the sluggish glands has been established beyond cavil by the work of many investigators and has been testified to by countless observing physicians. There is voluminous literature accumulating substantiating the soundness of my contention, namely, that diabetes is not dependent solely upon the impairment of the pancreas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Roubitschek </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Klin. Wchsnchr.</span><span class="font9"> June, 1923) speaks of three types of diabetes, pancreatic sclerosis, pituitary and renal type, and states that “diabetes is not simply a disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism, but a localized disease of the endocrine glands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This coincides with my statement that the pancreas is the registering apparatus which proclaims the sins of omission of the other members of the endocrine system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">E. J. Kraus </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Klin. Wchsnchr.</span><span class="font9"> Aug., 1923) also states that he found “changes of varying degrees in all the endocrine organs in diabetes”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">E. Freund </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Wiener Klin. Wchsnchr.</span><span class="font9"> July, 1923) says in part: “ ... it is at least interesting that the vasomotor effect alone is capable of explaining many of the phenomena of diabetes. Another instructive example exists in the effects of the various endocrine glands. The pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands are classified (Eppinger) as vasodilators in diabetes, the pancreas and parathyroid as constrictors, arresting diabetes. While constrictive when first administered, adrenalin after a time becomes vasodilative.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The teaching of these and similar findings is that, to use the expression of McCann, Hannon and Dodd (Johns Hopkins Hospital, July, 1923), “Insulin is pronounced in no sense a cure for diabetes, and it is highly important that other methods of influencing the disease favorably should not be neglected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the principle of toxin-stifled glands in mind we are relieved of a good deal of guessing, incident to results obtained in the treatment of various afflictions, results for which we had no other plausible explanation. Only upon the detoxination theory, it appears, can we understand &quot;why, for instance, malaria infection cured paresis, why anti-epileptic serum has cured epilepsy, why milk injections proved an effective galactogogue, and why the entire glandular system often responds to the administration of a single substance. It appears that in the poison, particularly eholin-splitting and ousting effect of certain preparations, is the answer.</span></p>

In other words, our greatest and biggest and best and wisest and most patriotic bankers took the American people by the heels and swung them in a circle until every nickel they could get had been detached from their trousers, and then they threw what was left on the ash pile.

Another stole $200,000 while treasurer of a county; another, $00,000 while treasurer of another county.

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font9">T IS a matter of common knowledge that the world is in its present condition because it has been mistaught. Big Business has taught that all the assets of the world should be put in its maw, and the common people held down to a bare subsistence. Only now is it discovering that the common people have no jobs, and when they have no jobs they have no wages, and when they have no wages they can buy nothing, and when they can buy nothing there is no business for anybody, big or little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big politicians have taught that by the route of battleships, bombing planes, torpedoes, tanks, flame throwers and poison gas, as well as cannons and machine guns, it is their duty to do the will of Big Business, regardless of what happens to anybody who gets in the way. Only now are they beginning to learn that when there is a big war, the side that wins the war loses its best customers, at home and abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big preachers have always taught that the governments of this world, including Japan, are parts of Christ’s kingdom, and constitute the “higher powers” to which all should be subject. They therefore fall in line with every act of Big Business and big politicians, bless it, and do their best to sell it to the common people as a substitute for the kingdom which Jesus taught His disciples to pray for, ‘Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Meantime a few people who have their eyes open, Jehovah’s witnesses, continue to bear testimony to the truths of the Bible, that all present governments are part and parcel of Satan’s empire, the same that he showed to Jesus, and which Jesus spurned when offered to Him. They bear testimony to God’s purpose to replace all these institutions of men with a new and better organization of things at the hands of Him who testified, “I make all things new.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are now living in the day when the shift from the old organization to the new is taking place. As the work progresses, the Scriptures show, some will discern the change of dispensation sooner than others, and among these there will be representatives of the clergy. Notice Zechariah 13: 4, 5:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And it shall some to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman ; for man taught me to keep cattle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Something like this is taking place in Texas county, Oklahoma. One minister wrote to one of Jehovah’s witnesses, asking him to look after his affairs if anything should happen to him; another resigned, ostensibly for a rest, and that in a business which consists in resting for a week at a time, with only a few minutes of work on Sundays. Still another resigned stating that he was going on a farm. Wise man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reverend R. L. Wells is not as wise. In a lengthy article in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Texas County Neivs</span><span class="font9"> he wants the county put on a war basis, with the same old gang in control that has always been in control, and that is responsible for getting the country into its present predicament. The common people would be dressed in overalls, and all under 50 put under military rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Obviously, when such a plan goes into operation, the best place in it would be reserved for the Reverend AVells. No overalls and alarm clock for him. Not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">yet.</span><span class="font9"> But it will do him little good to think of the conditions of 1917-1918, when the preachers were using their churches as recruiting stations and hounding the young men out to kill one another, and when they were most honored and admired of men. They have had their day, and the wise ones are breaking for the long grass, while they can.</span></p>

Three little chaps in Kentucky had some of the materials for a sling shot. They needed the fork of a limb, and climbed a tree to get it. The tree was on the premises of the presiding elder of the Danville district of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The presiding elder fired at the boys, and they started to run. He called to them to stop. They kept running, and he fired twice more. The last time he fired the bullet entered the brain of twelve-year-old Mitchell Bailey and the poor little colored boy will never see again, though he still lives, more is the pity. A presiding elder is a “character-builder” on a big scale, and even a small-sized, one-horse character-builder knows that a little twelve-year-old colored boy ought not to make sling shots; and, besides, why have a gun if you never use it?</span></p>

Mrs. Agnes Wilcox, local representative for Judge Rutherford, introduced us to a tall, distinguishedappearing man with gray hair and a youthful face who told us that his home is in Saginaw, Mich., hut that at present he is in Green City, from which point he is carrying on work for the man we were about to hear. “Brother Thompson is the name,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brother Thompson delivered a short set speech, evidently memorized. It explained that on July 30, 1933, Judge Rutherford had delivered an address in Plainfield, N. J., before 1,800 persons in defense of 56 of “Jehovah's witnesses” who had been thrown into jail for “speaking the truth” and distributing reading matter concerning Rutherford’s work. The city was seething with excitement, and the theater was filled with armed policemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The introduction concluded, here came the voice of Judge Rutherford by electrical transcription. It filled the room, and one needed little imagination to visualize the scene. There was no passion, and little denunciation; rather the scholarly presentation of an able jurist summing up the evidence. Judge Rutherford was not molested, and the accused were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The room was quiet, the listeners attentive. Lulled by the steady flow of language, by warmth and quietness, a workingman nodded in his chair. But we have seen many a tired man sleep in church. At the lecture’s close it was announced there would be a study period and all who desired might stay. Most of the audience did so. The service concluded with a hymn, a short prayer, and the announcement of services and a lecture by Judge Rutherford next Sunday at 2: 30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was interesting to learn that this remarkable man, Joseph Rutherford, was born and reared in Boonville, Mo., practiced law and was elected to a judgeship in St. Louis, and gave up his important and lucrative position to carry on this work in which he is still engaged. His home now is in New York. The followers of Judge Rutherford believe that they are “Jehovah’s witnesses’’ as set forth in the Scriptures, that we are living in the “last days” and that the present condition of the world and the World War is the work of his Satanic majesty, the Devil. Most of us can agree with that. We were told that Rutherford’s talks had been barred from the air in some foreign countries but were given by electrical transcription as they were here. An attempt is being made to bar Rutherford’s talks by radio in this country; something we do not approve. Nor did we approve the efforts made to bar the militant Father Coughlin. Let us have free speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is nothing of the fanatic about Kirksville followers of Judge Rutherford who style themselves “Jehovah’s witnesses”. They impressed us as being sincere, earnest people, and whether one agrees with them or not it is an interesting experience to attend one of the meetings. And most unusual: There is no collection.</span></p>

An old pair of his trousers were found on a beach, and memorial services were held for him in the Baptist church of which he had been pastor for three years. When the police located him he lied at first, not wishing to disclose his real identity, but finally admitted that he had been a preacher, but insisted he was now leading an honest life. The prophet foresaw cases of this kind when he wrote: “But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.” (Zechariah 13:5) The fib which he told when located is explained on the ground that it is hard to break away from old habits long practiced in the pulpit. The man is now in a business where he is not apt to further dishonor God’s name, and unless wanted back in Debert for some statutory crime he should be let alone.</span></p>

The Electric Boat Company made the plans and the Vickers Armstrong Company made the submarines for Britain, Canada, Ireland and India; the Boat Company itself had a corner on business with the United States and Cuba; the Vickers Company passed the plans directly to Japanese, Dutch, Australian and Spanish munitions concerns; also German and Italian. What a comfort it will be, if war breaks out between these recent brothers in arms, for them to know when they are sent to the bottom that the plans were all alike, and everybody who could pay the price could get them! Various munitions firms in Europe paid the Electric Boat Company £800, 000 in royalties for the privilege of using its plans.</span></p>

The one tangible result has been the discharge of many old civil service employees in the name of economy, and their replacement by a new and greater army of officials without the traditional requirements of civil service. This army is prying into everybody’s business, meddling in every conceivable detail of our lives, and changing their policies so fast that by the time you think you know what they want you find that they want something else.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Some Reflections on Taxes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">(By Daniel W. Hoan, Socialist mayor of Milwaukee, admittedly America's best-governed city)</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">AXPAYERS’ leagues have sprung up or grown strong all over the country during the present depression. They demand a drastic reduction of federal, state and local taxes, and characterize the income tax as confiscatory. They condemn governmental waste and extravagance, speak vaguely of dispensing with useless services and consolidating boards and commissions, and demand salary slashes all along the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They claim that excessive taxation is draining the financial resources of our industries, curtailing production and preventing a return to prosperity. They oppose every attempt to make high incomes and inheritances pay a more just share of the cost of government, and propose to put into effect a sales tax which falls hardest on the common man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Government had no share in causing the depression, but it has stood like the Rock of Gibraltar in this frightful time to save us the agonies of complete chaos. While banks failed, factories closed, shops went bankrupt and pyramided utilities collapsed, the government was expected to function, and did function, with more vigor and energy than ever before. All who were in distress flocked to their governments with outstretched hands. Few indeed were those who did not seek some kind of governmental assistance or subsidy. Even the geniuses of banking, insurance and railroads are not to be excluded. The farmers and the unemployed were depending on the government to save them from starvation and eviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fact is that private business practically collapsed. It cuts its pay rolls to the tune of eleven billions of dollars a year—a sum greater than all the costs of the combined governments of the United States. Millions of people were thrown out of work and onto poor relief and yet the very men who profited most by governmental subsidies at the top were most active and instrumental in organizing the “cut cost of government” leagues throughout the country. It is the bigger interests in all communities that lead the assault on governmental services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When banks, newspapers and business generally engage in wholesale bribery to avoid paying their just share of taxes, it is not surprising that we have grafting officials in cities like New York and Chicago. Private legitimate business has been the worst offender in corrupting government in order to obtain special privileges. It is notorious that newspapers which holler the loudest about government are often the biggest tax-dodgers in their cities. Colonel Robert McCormick’s editorials and pamphlets about the cost of government make an interesting study compared with the Chicago </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune’s </span><span class="font9">tax record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do we really want cheap government at any cost? Do we want to send our children to the cheapest school that employs the cheapest school teachers? Do we want firemen and policemen paid such low salaries that we may expect none but grafters and ignoramuses to man these departments? Do we want our public health services operated so cheaply that contagion and epidemics rage throughout our communities or that there is neglect in inspecting our food products, resulting in the poisoning of ourselves and our families ? Do we want dangerous and broken streets, defective lighting, inadequate sewage disposal, no garbage collection ? If the cheapest kind of government is what we really want, then we might expect important industries to migrate to small villages where there is little or no public service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The per capita cost of sending a child to the public school is usually about one-half the cost of the same service in a private school. The same comparison can be made in practically all governmental services. This is true even where a charge is made against such services for the amount of taxes which such services should bear. Bad as some of our city governments are, you get more for your tax dollar than you do for any other dollar you spend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, we should not forget that a large share of city taxes could be met by public ownership of all public utilities. The average worker who owns a home pays more for light, gas and telephone service in a year than he does for taxes. If the cities owned these utilities, the tax bill could be cut all the way from 33$ to 100 percent. There are several score of cities and towns in the United States today where the entire cost of city administration is met by their publicly owned utilities. But, of course, the taxdodgers aren’t interested in promoting public ownership. They are always lined up with the big fellows because that’s their gang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The salary paid to the president of our local street railway and light company in 1931 was</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">$96,000. </span><span class="font9">This sum is more than the combined salaries of the mayor and 32 heads of departments in the government of Milwaukee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At present there is no federal tax on estates under $50,000, and the maximum tax is 45 percent on all estates over $10,000,000. Some claim that this is exorbitant. We hold that no tax on inheritance is exorbitant. No person, or no entire family, has ever done anything even by present standards which would entitle them to receive $10,000,000 without one bit of work. The right of inheritance is not an inherent constitutional right. It has been made by statute and custom, and obviously should be subject to the most drastic restrictions. This practice of the transmission of huge fortunes is a most antisocial one, and tax rates on inheritances and gifts should be kept at the absolute maximum. In its limited fashion this is one effective way to redistribute wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a well known fact that the cream of our income is skimmed off in New York and vicinity. Obviously an income tax benefiting only New York is unjust, since the money is made all over the country. A far more equitable plan would be to have all income taxes levied by the federal government and rebated to states according to their population and their needs. The state would be saved the expense of administering a separate income tax and would not have to worry about tax-dodgers, while every honest taxpayer would be benefited in that only one income tax return would be necessary and the tax would reach all fortunes, regardless of whether they were accumulated by land speculation, industry, or stock manipulation. This would eliminate those two American frauds, the Delaware corporation and the Florida official resident. It would enable each state to receive a share of the taxes in direct proportion to the expense incurred by these taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Other Side of It</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font9"> calls sharp attention to the fact that expenses of federal, state and local governments for 1934 will amount to $17,000,000,000, which is quite a little bit more than one-third of the national income. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font9"> wonders that Americans are any longer willing to support so many governmental units, 182,839, all together, including states, counties, cities, towns, villages, boroughs, townships, school districts, and other divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO SHALL RULE THE WORLD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE present rule of the world is unsatisfactory to all who desire good government. In every country there is much poverty, suffering, distress and perplexity. Are the rulers responsible therefor? It is written: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” (Proverbs 29:18) Will there soon be a change of world rule for the peoples’ good? These questions will be clearly and satisfactorily answered</span></p>

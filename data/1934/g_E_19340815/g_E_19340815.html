<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Could America Live Alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE DOUGLAS SOCIAL CREDIT PROPOSALS (Reprinted from the Sydney, New South Wales, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New Era)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">PEAKING at St. Kilda, the minister for customs (Mr. White) said that “the crash in the United States had been caused by a high protection policy. To think that any nation could live alone was a fallacy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any self-contained nation like the United States not only could live alone, but could live remarkably well. Does Mr. White suggest that if all the other nations of the earth, following a contraction of the earth’s crust, were submerged under the sea—with all their troubles and bankers—the United States would perish?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No doubt our cousins would miss their poor relations and the happy hunting grounds of Europe so dear to American tourists, but apart from this loss, the fact that America was thrust upon its own resources, without any international complexities, or the senseless clamor for export markets, would be more in the nature of an economic God-send to the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They would then, at least, have a reasonable chance of settling down to enjoy all that America could produce, instead of giving it away to other nations in the form of overseas investments for which the American people receive worthless pieces of paper in return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world crisis is due, chiefly, to one cause: a shortage of purchasing power. Of everything else there is abundance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shortage comes about because it is impossible for any industry to pay out sufficient purchasing power to cover the cost of the goods it produces. This is true of all industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The use of labor-saving machinery increases the shortage of purchasing power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only way this chronic shortage can be remedied is by the nation’s taking over the control and issue of all money. The control of money is the constitutional right of the Crown, but the private banks have usurped this right. The banks do not, as is popularly supposed, lend deposits. They create credit. In fact, all the money in the community has its origin in a debt to the banks. Banks being the only source of money, the community is obliged to borrow for all its needs and to pay interest, a factor which puts the State, companies and industries into increasing indebtedness to the banking system, giving rise to a colossal interest burden. Ninety-nine percent of money is bank-created money, created as a debt against the community’s assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Douglas Proposals simply involve that the nation should reassert its right to the ownership and control of money, and that money (bank credit) should be issued to expand or contract with production and consumption. This credit will be issued, debt free, to the limit of the nation’s productive capacity, thus effecting an equation between money and production. AVhat it can produce in real credit—goods and services—will be the limit of its creation of financial credit. This cannot be done, particularly in a machine age, without recognizing the principle of consumer credit. The wide and widening disparity between production and purchasing power can be bridged only by consumer credit, and to this end the Douglas Proposals involve the payment of a national dividend to every man, woman and child, and a just price discount of at least 25 percent on all purchases made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Always remember that money is a costless creation, and provided it is issued and canceled scientifically, in the manner proposed by Major C. H. Douglas, there can be no repetition of the evils of inflation or deflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under these Proposals a proper system of national accountancy would be put into operation, whereby financial credit (money) will balance with real credit (goods and services).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Put in another way, the Douglas Proposals provide:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span><span class="font6"> That the cash credits of the population of any country shall be at any moment collectively equal to the collective cash prices of the goods for sale in that country, and such cash credits shall be canceled on the purchase of the goods for consumption.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. That the credits required to finance production shall be supplied, not from savings, but be new credits relating to new production.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. That the distribution of cash credits to individuals shall be progressively less dependent upon employment. That is to say that the dividend shall progressively replace the wage and salary.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The Douglas Proposals would create a bountiful prosperity within a few months of their legislative adoption. Taxation would rapidly become a thing of the past—an unpleasant memory. The death-knell of interest and usury would be sounded. The burden of national and industrial indebtedness would be removed. Human poverty and the dark fears of economic insecurity would give place to a new era of abundance, with security, leisure, and culture for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(We print the foregoing because of its reasonableness, but with no idea that anything on earth would induce the banks to surrender their grip on the windpipe of the people. Before they would let go they would cheerfully see the earth and everything in it, including themselves and their families, go up in smoke, dissolve into thin air and disappear for ever. Those who are giving their time and strength to putting forward the Douglas Proposals could put them to much better use by devoting them to the earth-wide proclamation of God’s kingdom as the one and only hope of the world.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>At the Levee</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">By the author of &quot;Ode to the Milkman”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">SCRIBE in the household of Nebuchadnezzar is expected to attend to that gentleman’s needs while “spreading himself” at his state functions, and, though every flare of glory appeals to one as stage decorations (gold paint over cardboard, so aptly characterized as “trash”; “shoddy,” to the stage hands), still “the play must go on”, they say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rulers are actors, decked in gaudy tinsel which amuses childish minds: each one strutting out on the stage enjoys playing “toy soldiers” in the parade, not yet grown out of the thrill we all enjoyed as kidlets that “I’m the king of the castle, and you're the dirty rascal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Behind the “works” are the stage hands, the “razorbacks”, in this scene officially known as “deputies” and “secretaries”, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To please their own infantile dignity and the people, the scene must be well laid; little oversights will be patched up by the news reporters so that the news of the “king's doings” are properly dolled up before the people. “And my people love to have it so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is at these functions that the inherent animal quality in man asserts itself, and he finds excuse for trying to decorate himself with more show than the female of the species, as is universally found among animals and birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Levee in question is staged each year by the governor general of Canada in the Senate chamber. It occurs on New Year’s day. On that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(secretary to a high government official)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">occasion the governor general assumes his best uniform, medals and decorations, and all the superlative (and superfluous) adjectives before and after his name. He is attended by his secretary and several aides-de-camp, which, being translated, means more big children who love soldier uniforms with more superabounding adjectives before and after their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before “His Excellency” pass all the officers of state dolled up in uniforms, which, if worn on “Alain Street” would be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prima facie</span><span class="font6"> evidence of walking “delirium tremens”, “infantile paralysis” of the brain or insanity. Similar uniforms, I believe, are worn by some inmates of asylums for the insane who similarly delude themselves into believing that shiny colors and adjectives make great men. Likewise, these officials wear any names but those which designate the original child as its mother knew it. “The Right Honorable”— (here follows the alphabet in assorted combinations), just as if these added names changed the character to which they were appended, or made it more honorable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Exceeding great care must be taken to see that each dignitary keeps his proper place in the order of precedence. One error in this regard might cause a worse explosion than throwing a copy of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font6"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orange Sentinel</span><span class="font6"> into the same waste paper basket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This order of officialdom is called a “Table of Precedence”. First come the lieutenant governors of the provinces, then the prime minister, then archbishops and bishops according to seniority, then the moderator of the Presbyterian church and the general superintendent of the Methodist church. Members of the Dominion cabinet follow, then the chief justice of Canada, members of the Privy Council, the speakers of the Senate and House of Commons, the prime ministers of the provinces, etc. How the archbishops and bishops get in on this and still keep themselves “separate from the world” and their “garments unspotted” is beyond me!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the present time the Catholic bishops are making pleasant facial contortions inside their broad phylacteries (which, being translated, means that they are “grinning up their sleeves”) because they are ahead of the Anglicans in their representation on the Table of Precedence. When they learn, as they will do, that the higher they climb in worldly precedence, the lower they fall in the Lord’s estimation, Anglicans will be more content with their enforced humility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some seven hundred people appeared before the governor general. The deputies and secretaries have first arranged about automobile accommodation for officialdom, the doors, the dress to be worn, the brass band, the guards, the reception, the cards of introduction, the wine, the cigars, and the doughnuts (the term “doughnuts” is borrowed from Canada’s aristocracy review, the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night.</span><span class="font6"> Will that paper kindly copy this paragraph and note that, on this occasion, the “doughnuts” were charged up to the “public”; unlike delegates to I.B.S.A. conventions, the guests didn’t bring their own “doughnuts” with them).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Students of mathematics should enjoy the “Levee” immensely; for they would see all sorts of “figures”. The uniforms are invariably tight-fitting. The colors and fit frequently emphasize bodily infirmities, or, should we say, encumbrances. Representing the normal man by the figure “1” or the letter “I”, in Windsor uniform a portly man looks like a figure “9” or, if his chest has slipped as far as his waistband, like a figure “6”, or, if the distribution of avoirdupois has been equal in all directions, a figure “0” from a front view and “D” from a side view. A victim of chronic indigestion, underweight, with an admiral’s hat on, would resemble the letter “T”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Using the above-mentioned letters after the official’s name would, we suggest, give a more accurate introduction to the gentleman than his present title. For instance, the Honorable Partijob Hunter, K.C., O.B.E., would, without a photograph, be indistinguishable from any other official; but term him the Right Comfortable Partijob Hunter, O.D. (“0” representing a front view, and “D” a side view), and you could, at least, judge that he was past middle age, weighed 200 to 300 pounds (gross). It 'would be safe, too, to suggest that his skeleton nestled in three-ply rubber cushions (built for comfort, not speed) and that he could fill a chesterfield to overflowing, more or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, to get on with the show, the band gets seated in the corridor outside the Senate chamber. The leader is full weight, bald and shiny. The cornet players are mostly short of hair, and the drummers have imaginary mustaches (indicative of their intelligence, so phrenologists say); the trombone artists look serious and concentrating. At first sight one might think they were operating vacuum cleaners to mop the floor with instead of windpipes for inhaling flies off the chandelier. All the time they w’ere trying to slide their pipes under someone else’s chair, but either their arms weren’t long enough or they were afraid the pipe would come out and they couldn’t get it back in again. The looks on their faces suggested that their mentality followed their sliding pipes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This band is called “the governor general’s footguards”. What they guard is hard to say, though the bandmaster’s contortions suggested he had had experience as a traffic cop or the governor general’s private street-car stopper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far, we have the band seated (though it is hard to keep the drummers down). The scenery is intended to be gorgeous, but falls short of that. The walls are massive stone, palace-like. A red carpet leads into the Senate chamber, sometimes called the “Red Chamber”. Inside, the uniforms are red and black, trimmed with gold and blue and, to a lesser extent, with silver and other colors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those calling to pay their respects to “His Excellency” have discarded their coats and hats in a room allotted to that purpose. Special rooms have been provided where the dignitaries of church and state may, in advance, don their gay uniforms. Each person has been informed that he is to equip himself with two cards having his name, clearly legible, thereon. As the long procession passes into the Chamber, the governor’s confidential messenger, duly informed, takes one card, scans the name, and, if you haven’t a beard (the kind that distinguishes the Bolsheviks from the venerable church patriarchs) or a bomb, permits you to pass. The second card is not required until the a.d.c. to “His Excellency<sup>-</sup>’ is reached. He takes the card, reads the name, hands it to a second a.d.c., who in turn hands it to the governor’s secretary who, at the proper time, announces “The Right Honorable the Prime Minister” or “His Grace the Archbishop of Flatbush”, or “The Reverend Bedlam A. Sylum”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Personally, I was stuck to find a proper handle for the front of my name. I wasn’t “honorable”, nor old enough to be “reverend”. For that matter, looking into some of the political records of many admitted to the Levee it is hard to see where they were honorable either. That word “Grace”, too, sounded out of place. One always associates it with a “sweet sixteen”, not with a conscienceless, rotund, well-fed fleecer of the sheep. I did wonder whether “The Right Honorable John Jones, H.H.C.”, would look right. The Scriptures certainly indicate that “House-to-House Canvassing”, as I have done it, is a right honorable profession! However, one doesn’t insist on occasions like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, we pass these toy soldiers, any one of whom might, by the uninitiated, be mistaken for the governor himself. Then the great moment comes—actually to shake hands with the governor general. The thought of such a privilege at one time thrilled me. Now I get more kick out of meeting another who thinks with me of a new kingdom, and a better one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“His Excellency” is a tall, slim gentleman, and, it must be said, is admirably suited to his position. Behind him, by this time, have gathered members of the Government, so that the picture looks more like a mediaeval king surrounded by courtiers than a modern government reception. On the other side of the room, opposite the governing group, Sir Henry Thornton, K.B.E., president of the Canadian National Railways, in uniform, stands head and shoulders, almost, above the group with him. All around the room hang beautiful, gorgeous paintings, illustrative of Canada’s share in the war. At the far end is the “Chair” or “Throne” from which the “Speech from the Throne” is read at the opening of Parliament. At present it is unoccupied save that two military men occupy seats at either side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The governor talks pleasantly and, in his company, he is to be admired. Possibly iro one thing blinds the common people more to their condition of oppression and the rule of the adversary than that the adversary uses noble, honorable men as heads to maintain the system which holds the people in subjection. So often the inexperienced (but honest) “bolshevik” who can talk from the soap box so fluently about the “rich” and “oppression” is struck dumb when, for the first time, he actually meets those whom he preaches against, only to find that, instead of their being wicked “grafters”, their code of morals is as high as his own. He concludes that his preaching has been wrong somewhere, and is sidetracked himself into supporting what he previously opposed. This is the record of “reformers” for ages. Many Christian people make the same mistake. To work for a government official, and possibly admire some of his personal characteristics, to some means that one is deluded by the adversary into thinking he is “righteous” when, as they say, “all politicians are grafters.” Such a thought is wrong, for many otherwise “righteous” men are held, firmly bound by the system which oppresses them and which uses them to oppress others. If more people made sure of what they believed, they would be intelligent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now, after the governor general has wished us happiness and prosperity for the year, who can stop it? Personally, we pass on hurriedly to something more substantial, the doughnuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are provided in a near-by room where, for once, distinguished and long-extinguished politicians together pick up sandwiches, olives and cake with champagne. I pick up a dainty sandwich, and get my glass filled—my conscience all the time tossed dizzily from one horn of a dilemma to the other: Will the Bible students who know me excommunicate me for a glass of champagne? or will the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font6"> tell the public that I didn’t bring my own “doughnuts”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All that is left now is the shouting. The press supplies this. The common people drink it all in—some young political, unsophisticated enthusiasts urge you to turn ’em out of office and ‘put a good government in’, if it costs too much, —but invariably they put in another that costs them more,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And, “my people love to have it so.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Some Remarks on the Dictatorship </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Louis T. McFadden</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">SPHERE are two things which a man must -L have if he is to be called a leader. He must be going some place and somebody must be following him. The gentlemen who appear as leaders on this floor are not leaders in any sense of the word. They do not lead. They follow. They do not hold the status of generals or colonels or majors or captains or even second lieutenants. They are corporals and file closers, whose only permitted function is to shout ‘‘Hep! Hep!” and pass the orders to this awkward squad which is not yet trained to the technique of the goosestep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am not making a partisan Republican speech. I was thrown out of the Republican party by the alleged leadership of that organization two years ago. I have had my own experiences with leadership. When I was &quot;cast into the outer darkness’ by the leaders of the party of which I have been a member all my life, the Republican voters of my district went out into the shadows with me. After looking over their surroundings, the Democratic voters of my district followed their Republican neighbors and joined us in the wilderness of presidential disapproval. I was reelected on both Democratic and Republican tickets, and I hold my warrant as a member of this House from the people, and not from the parties of my district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I am partisan—and I may as well admit that I am—that partisanship is for the people whom I represent. 1 received their orders in November 1932. Those orders have never been countermanded, and I will follow them until they are countermanded by the people from whom I accepted them. I will take orders from no one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Franklin Delano Roosevelt received his orders on the same day that I received mine. The orders he is following today are not the orders he accepted than—and the orders he accepted then were drafted by himself in his campaign pledges and sealed with his inaugural oath. I do not know the source of the orders he is following today. I do not know that he is following either order or orders. He admits himself that he is trying first one course of procedure and then another in the hope of finding a good one. He has not presented to this body, to the Senate, or to the public any plan or any program of what he proposes to do with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He has shown but one of the qualifications of leadership. People are following him, but he does not know where he is going. I cannot follow him until I know his destination—not and keep my self-respect as a man and an American. Neither can the people of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The partisanship that you are creating is a partisanship that will align two opposing forces in this country—the people versus the Government. The American people are thoughtful and deliberate, but they always achieve decision in the end. When this extravaganza of experiment and expenditure, this blind stumbling in the face of disaster, shall have reached its inevitable climax, when all our alphabetical overlords shall have unified themselves into one mighty final set of initials, and those initials the fateful I.O.U., then, gentlemen of the majority, you will have partisanship. It will he partisanship based on bitterness and disillusionment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why is it that you fear debate ? Why is it that your leader answers no questions, gives no information, offers no chart or road map, but demands only unthinking obedience to ordeis which he himself cannot put into words ? Gentlemen of the majority, why do you sit silent and refuse to defend your course ’! Is it because that course has no defense—or is it because you do not know what the course is, nor whether there is any defense for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentlemen of the majority, these and many other moving fingers have penned the handwriting on this wall you have tried to build around the rights and privileges which you ask that we surrender to your leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many years the affairs of this country were mishandled by self-styled financial experts who seized upon political power in the name of business. Their dishonesty of thought and method were the fabric of our disaster. The land rose and cried out against these men. You seized the public resentment as your opportunity and, by promising to it satisfaction for its wrongs, you won your way into power. You had a great opportunity. What did you do with it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You turned over the processes of government to the very same individuals who had wrecked us as financial experts, giving them barely time to change their clothes and rechristen themselves economic experts. You asked and secured unlimited executive power in the name of emergency and then turned that power over to the men you had denounced as criminals, giving them legal protection and unlimited use of the public funds to bring their personal ambitions to a profitable conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is now before the proper committee of this body a resolution calling for a full investigation into the conduct of the radio business in the United States. I introduced that resolution in the last Congress, and it is still alive. No action has been taken upon it. Like many other matters pending before this Congress, no attention will be paid to it unless it has presidential approval. Will the administration get presidential approval of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will the Rules Committee put that resolution upon its passage, and will the majority pass it and conduct a full and impartial investigation? No member of this Rouse who reads his mail can say that there is no public demand for such an investigation. You all know that there is, and you all know that the radio situation should be dealt with by Congress, and that without further delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I sometimes feel that all that this House is, now that we have abandoned the Constitution, and resolved ourselves into a rubber stamp, is a sounding board and, even at that, we are restricted lest that sounding board produce something which, in the judgment of the administration of this House, should not be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I know now that nothing I say upon this floor will receive the compliment of attention from the majority. I am listed as a ‘'trouble-maker”, as a critic of all administrations, as one whose outlook upon life and affairs is through blue glasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is not the truth. I am not against anyone, except as that person or group is against the interest of the public. I am a defender, not an assailant. I present my complaint against conditions to the House, fully and fairly in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font6"> not by whispered innuendo or implied suggestion. I present my complaint, knowing that it will receive no attention from a majority which is blind because it will not see, which is deaf because it is forbidden to hear. I present my complaint so that it will be a matter of record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentlemen of the majority, I might be one of you if I chose. I was elected to this House upon the Democratic as well as upon the Republican ticket. I cannot join you. You do not carry your power gracefully. You have yet to learn moderation. Power is like alcohol. A little raises one’s spirit to the heights. Too much puts body and soul in the gutter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The War-Makers </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By P. E. Saddlemire</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font6">INETEEN HUNDRED years ago, when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ lived here on earth, He declared, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” If the peacemakers are the children of God, then whose children are the warmakers ? The Scriptures lay down the rule that there are only two masters, Jehovah and Satan. If the peacemakers are the children of God, the war-makers are the children of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And who are the war-makers? The war-makers are the generals and other leaders of the military armies of the earth. The war-makers are the great financiers and profiteers who have robbed their fellow men of home and health and happiness, and who have heaped up for themselves treasures for the last days. The warmakers are the crooked politicians who, when running for office, make many specious promises, but who, when once elected, never keep any promises made to the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And the war-makers are also the hypocritical clergy of the denominational systems of the earth who stand up in their pulpits, one day in seven, and fraudulently claim to he the representatives of the Lord God Almighty, but who in fact are the representatives of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of these—the generals and other leaders of the military armies of the earth, the great financiersand profiteers, the crooked politicians, and the hypocritical clergy—are the ones who make war, who preach war, and who cause men to go to war, and are the Devil’s children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And they are debarred by their own actions and words from denying the charges! The Scriptures lay down the rule, “By their fruits ye shall know them.” If a man shows the spirit of the Lord God, then it is to be taken for granted that such a man is on the side of the Lord. But if a man shows the spirit of the Devil, then it is manifest to everyone that such a man is on the side of the Devil. On whose side are the war-makers? By their fruits you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whose spirit do the war-makers show? Let us see. There are the generals and other leaders of the military armies of the earth, for example. They dress themselves up in the Devil’s livery, and they arm themselves with the Devil’s weapons; and then they swagger to and fro, up and down in the earth, and demand that the peoples of the world pay homage to them and look up to them as their heroes and their leaders. They help to create wars, and then compel their fellow men to join their armies, go to war, and kill their fellow men, and be killed. They also execute their fellow men upon the slightest pretext, and prove themselves to be merciless and heartless; and by so doing they show that the spirit of the Devil is in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great financiers and profiteers not only have robbed their fellow men of home, health and happiness, but they have also robbed them of their liberties and rights, and have treated them like the brute beasts of the field. They have oppressed and persecuted the common people with fiendish malignancy, and have driven myriads of our womanhood to the most loathsome prostitution. They have proved that they are pitiless and conscienceless; and they have done their best to turn this earth into a veritable hell for the races of men; and by so doing they show that the spirit of the Devil is in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The crooked politicians have joined hand in glove with the financiers, profiteers, and military leaders in oppressing the careworn, sorrowing peoples of earth; and when the common people plead pitifully for relief the politicians harden their hearts, and enact more stringent and oppressive laws, and then make sport when the anguished cry of the despairing peoples of earth rises to heaven. By all these things do the politicians prove that they are imbued with the Devil’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hypocritical clergy with mock sanctity and pious hypocrisy claim to be Jehovah’s spokesmen, and to be intrusted with keeping the souls of the common people. But instead of caring for the souls of the poor, downtrodden, oppressed peoples of earth, the clergy have, on the contrary, joined hand and heart with the Devil's organization, and they have lent their influence and support to the cruel, heartless financiers, profiteers, politicians and military leaders. They have helped to preach and inveigle the common people into every war that has ever been fought, and they have then acted as spies against the very people whom they have betrayed into the hands of the war-demon ; and they pretend at the same time that they are the friends of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They have turned their church edifices into recruiting stations in time of war, and they have preached millions of innocent men into a hellish death upon the bloody battlefields. They have renounced Jehovah God and His kingdom, and have spurned the great ransom sacrifice given for the sins of the whole world by God’s dearly beloved Son, Christ Jesus, and they persecute those who dare tell the message of God’s kingdom to earth’s groaning peoples. They have accepted Satan’s devilish League of Nations in lieu of God’s kingdom; and they have committed blasphemy against Jehovah by assuming for themselves the title of ‘“Reverend”, which title belongs to Jehovah God alone. By all of these things, and many more, the clergy prove that the spirit of the Devil is in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The case is now made out. The evidence shows that the financiers and profiteers, the politicians and military leaders, and the godless clergy are oppressors of their fellow men; that they are the instigators of all wars; that they have taken their stand on the Devil’s side; that they are against Jehovah and His kingdom; and that they are imbued with the spirit of the Devil, and have made this earth a veritable hell for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let the common people take notice! Mark those who are your enemies, and have nothing to do with them. There is a just God in heaven who presides over the affairs and destinies of men and nations, and who will in no wise pass over the transgressions of the guilty; but who, on the contrary, will in His own due time and way punish those who have oppressed His people, and will free the common people from all their enemies. He will cause the sound of war and murder to perish out of the earth for ever; and He will bring in everlasting peace and righteousness for the peoples. He shall cause love and truth to canopy the whole earth, and, instead of misery, woe, sorrow and oppression, there shall be happiness and joy, deliverance and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let the groaning peoples of earth lift up their heads and take fresh courage. A new day is dawning for the human race! The long, dreary night of sin, sorrow and death is passing away; and already the silvery, effulgent gleams of the grand Millennial morning are beginning to blush along the world’s horizon. The day of deliverance is at hand! “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">V</span><span class="font6">IVISECTION of dogs makes the heart sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Physicians who ought to know what they are talking about say that not one thing of any benefit to the human family has been learned from the torturing of pregnant dogs, lifting them to the ceiling and dropping them upon their backs on iron bars, crushing them by a gaseous pressure of a hundred atmospheres, pouring boiling water into their intestines, grafting in the kidneys of hogs in place of their own kidneys, removing the tops of their skulls, slitting their throats so that the food which they swallow drops out, prying their jaws apart mechanically, baking them to death, cutting their joints apart without severing the connecting nerves, strapping limbs in a dislocated position, keeping them alive with their hearts cut open, turning molten metal into their ears, gouging out their eyes and running around the empty sockets with sharp tools, cutting out their kidneys bit by bit, and removing their blood and pumping it in again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Things such as these have been done by the tens of thousands upon the most faithful of all man’s four-footed friends. One doctor with a heart, who knew all about these horrors, said: “After telling of all this, I need not add that I am ready to see, not only science, but the whole human race, go to destruction, before I would resort to such means to save it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do you not think that the One who marks the sparrow’s fall has a score to settle with these men that have done such terrible things to creatures as high-strung as dogs? A student who performed some of these operations said: “Occasionally a dog of good breed will crawl up to the man preparing another job on him, whine, plead in an uncannily human way for mercy and move even some of the students to emotion. It made me sick.” This was found in a student’s notebook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What kind of hearts can men have who will force marbles, five-cent pieces and collar buttons into a dog’s internal organs, even soaking them first in acids, so that when inserted into the kidneys they would be yet more painful? At Berkeley, California, students of the University of California killed a dog with ether. Then they revived him with a solution of chemicals inserted into his veins, and in another day he died again. What would the One who marks the sparrow’s fall think of that? The report of this “achievement” went all over the country as news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unusual Recognition of Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Old Cap, a wire-haired griffon of Ware, Massachusetts, was awarded the French Red Cross for service performed during the World War. After his return to America nothing would lure him near a barbed-wire fence. He saw all he wanted of barbed wire when trying to find the two-legged comrades wounded and lying in the shell holes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rags, of Fort Hamilton, New York, received two service stripes as well as a wound stripe for injury to his lungs from gas. He was decorated by the United States army and registered by footprint with the British war ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tip, a bull pup at Salem, Oregon, was officially mustered out of Company L, Second Oregon Infantry. He served in the Philippines. He was accredited with having caught chickens for the company when food was scarce on the firing line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">William Phillips, of Portsmouth, England, was rescued from death by drowning by a Newfoundland. Every year thereafter, on the anniversary of the rescue, he made a feast to men and dogs. A man in Denver, Colorado, left his entire estate of $150,000 to his dog Shep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Berlin has an ambulance car service for injured pets, while at Totteridge, England, a class of young women was trained for dog nursing, their plan being to locate among the people that have more money than brains. The prince of Wales has a collapsible kennel which folds up with straps into a handy bundle. It can be set up indoors and has a little runway for puppies. The old Fitchburg Railroad once had a dog officially upon its payrolls as an assistant watchman. Mrs. Richard Quigley, Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, rushed a dog by airplane from Newark to Boston, so that it would arrive in time to enter a dog show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An old bull terrier, of London, that had often been exhibited at dog shows, but was well past the flower of his age, surprised his master by calmly leaping into position among those on exhibition in the Horticultural Hall in Westminster. He did not get into the right classification, and was entirely unmoved by the laughing crowd that saw his efforts to break into print among the high-steppers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The natives of the Solomon islands believe that they can rid themselves of any ailment by naming their dogs for the ache. As a result, most of the dogs of the Solomon islands are called Maola, which means ‘stomach-ache’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Honors to Dogs’ Memories</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oatlands Park cemetery, England, was the first cemetery for dogs. It was founded in the eighteenth century. Three thousand dogs are buried in the Montmartre cemetery, near Paris. The sexton says that some of the dogs are laid away in silk-lined coffins and arrive at the cemetery in magnificent cars. Every year women come and plant flowers on their graves, while some of them kneel and weep. In a New York dog cemetery the granite mausoleum erected in memory of two pets, Sally and Toodles, cost $40,000. Joseph Foster, Inwood, Queens, erected a mausoleum in his back yard with the inscription “To Buddy, only a dog, but the best friend a man ever had.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Contact, mascot of the municipal airport at Oakland, California, died, he was given a regular funeral. Reverend Bernard Ruggles, of Oakland, preached the funeral sermon. We have noticed other dog funerals, preached by other ‘'reverends”. &quot;When Porky, mascot of the naval training school at Newport, Rhode Island, was buried two companies of recruits walked behind his funeral cortege as his body, draped with the United States flag, was drawn on an artillery caisson to his final resting place. We are merely stating the facts; not stating what we think of all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bing, of Dennison, Ohio, was assigned $60 a month as a soldier’s pension, was decorated for services in the World War, and was given a military funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lord Byron, on a marble shaft erected in memory of his dog, said: “Near this spot are deposited the remains of one who possessed beauty without vanity, strength without insolence, courage without ferocity, and all the virtues of man without his vices. This praise, which would be but meaningless flattery, if inscribed over human ashes, is but a just tribute to the memory of Boatswain, a dog, who was born at Newfoundland, 1803, and died at New-stcad Abbey, November 18, 1808.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Education of Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Albert Payson Terhune, successful breeder and trainer of dogs, gives the rules that go to make a well trained dog. When he arrives let his future master uncrate him, put him in the quarters he is to have, give him his first meal of bread and milk, and then let him alone. Keep friends and family away for a few days, until he gets over being homesick, which will take a day or so. Do not be impatient or careless, for, after all, he is only a baby. Don't swear at him or beat him. Go in and talk to him now and then, during the first day and night. Do not attempt to house-break him by punishment or by frightening and confusing him. Punishment should be by slapping lightly over the hips with a loosely folded newspaper, scolding gently as you do so, and must lie inflicted the moment the fault is committed. Make him understand that he belongs to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font6"> before you let anyone else play with him. If you cannot control your own temper, be not surprised if the dog cannot do better. Do not keep him in a damp cellar or an oven-hot room. Never call him to you to punish him. Table scraps are an ideal diet, but never any poultry bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Pennsylvania a shepherd dog seemed to worship his master, but only tolerated the small boy of the family. The boy became afflicted with infantile paralysis, and was left a cripple. The dog transferred his devotion to him, saw the boy being pulled around in a wagon, and himself started pulling it: now they are inseparable and the dog takes him safely all over town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Terhune says that it is by vanity that dogs are taught tricks and taught to mind. Praise a dog enthusiastically when he succeeds in doing something, and you have taught him. He taught a big collie to go up to the gate and bring in the morning paper. Before long the dog had picked up all the papers on that side of the lake and brought them to his master’s door. He had praised him too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Pittsburgh miss who lost one dog, killed in the street, has trained a collie so that it never crosses a street, or even steps into a street, except at her heels. When she throws a stick or ball into the street he will run as far as the curb and then stop so suddenly that he skids, until he gets word from her as to whether he may go on or not. A pocket of meat scraps and broken cookies, with plenty of praise and petting, was the method used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John L. Stoddard, the lecturer, has three dogs, grandmother, daughter and grandson. The grandmother and grandson have learned how to open a closed door, by pressing down on the handle and pushing or pulling the door open. The daughter never learned this: the grandson opens the doors for his mother, but the grandmother will not do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dog trainer urges men never to scold their wives in front of their dogs, because it ruins the dogs. He considers it a reproach to any man to own a dog that has bad manners. He also notes the interesting fact that dogs were manifestly intended to be human companions, for the reason that all attempts to educate wolves, foxes, jackals and hyenas to have affection for their human masters have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More About the Care of Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Clyde A. Basehoar, Washington, D.C., is a dentist for dogs. He has an office specially equipped with apparatus so that the dogs cannot break loose while he is examining their mouths, filling cavities, or extracting teeth that are too far gone. He even has a nurse as an assistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When stray dogs are found, experts know at once that the wild dog that has no home will try to find the darkest corner, but the one that has a good home and is merely lost will appeal to any friendly human to help him find his master and will make himself as conspicuous as possible. A home dog lost in city streets is in great and immediate danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dog’s bed should be clean and dry and off the ground, and not exposed to drafts. Kennels should be limewashed frequently and otherwise kept clean. For winter oat straw makes a comfortable bed; in the summer pine shavings or the bare boards are all O.K. If the dog sleeps in the house a Turkish towel or a small rug might be allotted to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cuba there are dog barbers that do a regular business of bobbing pooches. Fifteen modes are illustrated. The barber does a finished job, even to a slight razor trim and a dash of powder at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London sells thousands of pairs of goggles for dogs. Motorists do not like to have the dust get into their dogs’ eyes when riding on the highways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Kansas woman, afraid that her Airedale would fall into unsympathetic hands, left in her will that he must be painlessly put to death the day of her funeral—a very selfish request. A New York woman, a Miss Wendel, when offered several million dollars for a vacant lot, rejected the offer because then Toby, her dog, would have no place to play. Dog collars studded with red glass, so that pets may be seen at night, have also appeared in London. In New York, leather boots for all fours, oilskin slickers for rainy days, and woolen sweaters for clear cold days, are some of the things that are made and sold for dogs. London has a special taxi service for dogs, so that owners can send their pets to other parts of town without personally escorting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who had experience says that in bathing a dog, the way to make him stand still is to gently take hold of one of his front paws and hold it. The dog will then be so busy maintaining his balance that he will forget to shake himself. The head and ears should be washed last; finish in cool, not ice-cold, water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dog sweats mostly on his tongue. That is why panting cools him. He also sweats on the soles of his feet. He sometimes lives to be thirty, but is accounted old at twelve years of age. Sometimes his black coat turns almost white if he has a fit or a bad case of distemper. Eighty percent of the business of memorial animal hospitals is for treatment of dogs; most of the balance is for cats. Few birds, horses, goats or rabbits are treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dogs Need a Balanced Diet</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some people think that because a dog has teeth that are capable of tearing flesh he should have nothing to eat but meat. It is a poor argument, for several reasons. Humans have such teeth, and some of the longest-lived humans eat no meat at all. Leo von Stein, Great Dane, property of Charles W. Stein, Charleston, South Carolina, said to be the largest dog in the city, was raised on a meatless diet, mostly oatmeal mush, and bran biscuits baked hard to take the place of bone. He is said to like everything his master likes, except sauerkraut, and is never ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dingo, a Labrador husky that served in one of the Antarctic expeditions, could stand the cold all right, but back in White Plains, New York, when he accompanied his master to a party, and distinguished himself by sneaking into the dining-room ahead of time and making away with the five-pound roast that had been provided for the guests, the doctors could not save him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People who understand the matter claim that a dog should have a balanced diet, well mixed so that he will not be able to pick out the parts</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">he lilies and leave the rest. They recommend scrapings from the plates as excellent food; but poultry bones, because they splinter and often kill dogs, should be eliminated. Two or three times a week the dog should have a good-sized fresh beef bone from the butcher. Greasy stuff and candy are poor foods for dogs. When a dog gets run down, a little smoked herring is good for an appetizer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Puppies need four or five meals a day, but at a year can get along nicely on one meal. They need plenty of fresh water, and should be taken out for a short walk after feeding. Bread and milk is good food for a dog, and with crushed egg shells in it is better still. The lime in the shells strengthens the dog’s bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Alsatian Shepherds—German Police</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alsatian shepherds, better known as German police dogs, have an intelligence that is almost human, but are what are known as one-man dogs, and in the absence of the master no other member of the family is entirely safe in their presence. None can ever tell when they will turn upon those about them, and sometimes even upon their masters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These dogs have been known and widely used since about A.D. 600. A physician claims that the skull of the wolf and of the Alsatian shepherd are quite dissimilar, as are also their claws, and that attempts to cross the German shepherd with the wolf results only in a cringing, cowardly animal, active only at nighttime, very dissimilar to a dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the fact that relationship between the Alsatian dog and the wolf is stoutly denied, and it is probable that there is no such relationship, it yet remains that men have trained wolves to act as dogs, and it is said that one of the smartest on the Vienna force is an out-and-out wolf, captured by a police clerk while he was but a cub.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the United States dogs go on the railroads for about one-sixth of the passenger fare. In Germany it costs more for the dog than for the man himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England tests showed that the dogs bred in the south of England are more obedient than those bred in the north. In one instance two dogs sat still for fifteen minutes without stirring, until their masters came for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Halifax, Nova Scotia, the barking of a police dog at night resulted in saving the life of a man whose boat had capsized and who would certainly have drowned but for its intervention in his behalf. When discovered, the man was already unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Lynn, Massachusetts, a wandering police dog intervened to help a police officer who was having trouble in trying to arrest two drunken men. The drunks were resisting arrest, and the dog restrained them from attacking the officer. His efforts resulted in obtaining a good home for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Dogs of St. Bernard</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The original pack of dogs connected with the Hospice of St. Bernard was formed in 1812 from Newfoundlands crossed with mastiffs. They were purposely bred with short hair, to enable them to get through the drifts. England is now said to have the finest St. Bernards in the world, as the pack at the Hospice was nearly destroyed by an avalanche years ago. The pack was replenished by dogs brought from the Pyrenees, bred with the bloodhound, and not as desirable as the old St. Bernards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every Swiss child is familiar with the story of Barry, the St. Bernard buried in the Dog’s Cemetery at Paris. On his monument it says: &quot;‘Saved the lives of forty persons: he was killed by the forty-first.” The account of this incident says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that two travelers were lost in the Alps in a blinding snowstorm. One of them in his extremity insisted that, as a last resort, he should have recourse to the brandy flask. His comrade urged upon him the folly of this, inasmuch as after a brief period of exhilaration, the reaction would leave him in a worse condition than before. Refusing the advice of his friend, he drank heavily, and after forging ahead for a short distance, became utterly exhausted and sank in the snow. His companion struggled on and at last was able to reach the friendly shelter of the Hospice. Here he told the story of his fellow traveler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Barry was called by the monks and told to make the traveler’s trail, which he did, finding at length the man who had been left behind, unconscious in the snow. Barry finally, by various methods, roused him from his stupor only to be mistaken by the more or less dazed man for a wild beast. With what remaining strength he had, the traveler managed to get his knife out of his pocket and plunge it into Barry’s neck. In spite of this, the faithful dog kept at his task until the traveler realized that he had evidently been found by one of the dogs of the Hospice. He struggled to his feet, and half leaning on the dog, whose strength was rapidly failing from loss of blood, finally reached the Hospice. On its threshold this noble creature, who had stained every step of the walk back with his lifeblood, fell exhausted, having given to all humanity a lesson in fidelity to a trust as great as could well be taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On account of the severe climatic conditions to which they are exposed, the dogs at St. Bernard develop rheumatism and heart trouble and seldom live to be more than six or seven years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eskimo Sledge Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eskimo sledge dogs, Malamutes, were mute until they learned to bark from the dogs brought on the exploration ships. They endure a surprising amount of cold. Harnessed to a sledge, a team of five will draw a heavy load 60 miles a day, day after day. They have been known to cover 40 miles in a shade less than four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Female dogs are chosen as leaders in the teams, and as far as possible all the dogs in a team are members of one family. This promotes a natural harmony in teamwork, as a mother is interested in her puppies and manifests affection for them long after they are full-grown. Moreover, the females are the equals of or the superiors to the males in point of endurance. When a member of the pack is weakened or wounded the other members of the pack turn on him and devour him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For months at a stretch the Eskimo dog is tethered outside his master’s igloo, with no protection from the piercing winds. Once a day, except sometimes when a blizzard blows for days, he gets a chunk of frozen seal or walrus. When the blizzard blows the Eskimo stays inside and the dog outside, where the latter, in spite of his endurance, sometimes freezes to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whites had to show the Eskimos how to take care of their dogs. When little houses were made for them, out of packing boxes, the dogs at first refused to go into them, thinking them some kind of trap. Mosquitoes torture the poor things dreadfully in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until recently well trained Eskimo dogs were worth around $200 each, but now they go for a fraction of their former price. An airplane will travel in two hours a distance that a dog team will barely cover in eight days. Time is everything, and so, except for local hauls, the dog team will have to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bloodhounds and Greyhounds</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bloodhounds have been used since the time of the Romans in hunting and tracking down humans. The only way to throw a bloodhound </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">off </span><span class="font6">is to wade in water, and even then the dog will course up and down the shores for miles searching for the lost trail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bloodhounds, meaning hounds of pure blood, are very affectionate, will not quarrel with humans nor with other dogs, and in reality are shy in nature and sensitive to kindness or correction. The bloodhound is not ferocious in nature, but stands and bays at his game until his master comes up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bloodhounds have been known to hold a trail for thirty hours. They are notable for their deep-set, sorrowful eyes and excessively developed dewlaps and flews. The puppies are born very small and are remarkably easy to rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A greyhound can travel a short distance at 35 miles an hour. A fast foxhound will make 31 miles an hour. A terrier will run for half a mile at 26 miles an hour. The whippet, a cross between the greyhound and terrier, is only slightly less swift than a greyhound. Greyhound racing is very popular in Great Britain, and somewhat so in the United States. In England a fast racing greyhound may be worth as much as $5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Slow motion pictures of racing greyhounds, taken as they pursue an electric hare, are made by a new type of gyro-balanced camera, driven by clockwork, attached to the body of the hare. The use of foxhounds in hunting foxes has attracted much attention in Great Britain, but has never amounted to anything in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Irish wolfhound, standing three feet high at the shoulders, and weighing 154 pounds, is the largest of the British dogs. The pointer is the same as the hound, in scientific parlance. Egypt has a fever-hound: it is claimed that to stroke such a dog is a cure for fever. The statement sounds “fishy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Among the Big Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Great Danes are aristocrats among dogs, and wonderful watchdogs. A few years ago, in Missouri, a Great Dane tackled a burglar entering a window and killed the burglar, with the verdict “justifiable homicide” rendered in its favor. A Great Dane at Glens Falls, New York, became the mother of twenty puppies at one time, the largest family ever born at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The setter is considered an ideal household pet. Its gentleness, pleasant manner and uniformly good disposition make it an ideal pet in any family where there are children. The real difficulty is to provide sufficient exercise. If the dog does not have it he soon gets fat and lazy and sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scotch collie is one of the most intelligent and beautiful of dogs. At shearing time he brings in the sheep one by one as they are wanted. At night he is anxious to know if all the sheep are on hand. If not, he is off to the hills after the strays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Newfoundland, supposed to have originated in the country of that name, is famed for his remarkable fearlessness of water and the readiness with which he will risk his life to save humans from drowning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Airedale terrier is without fear of anything that walks or crawls. Lions, bears and wildcats are all the same to Airedales, and they are considered excellent for playing with and guarding children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the reign of James I three English mastiffs were let into the den of a lion to devour prisoners in the Tower of London. Two of the dogs were killed, but the third got a grip on the lion's lip and hung on until the lion was glad of the chance to get away and retreat to the innermost recesses of his den.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Homesick, seasick, and missing her master that had given her away, a mastiff leaped fifty feet from the deck of the steamer He de France while it was in midocean. She was believed to have been killed by the propellers of the boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bulldog was originally used for bull baiting, which beastly sport was abolished by act of Parliament in the year 1835. The bulldog is a great lover of children, and not nearly so vicious as he look's. However, they do sometimes attack humans, and on account of their death grip the attack is greatly to be dreaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Midland, Texas, a bulldog chased a jack rabbit into a fence corner. Turning on his pursuer, the rabbit sank his teeth into the dog’s cheek. The dog fled, and so did the rabbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Boston terrier is a cross between an English bulldog and the English terrier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dog-lovers decry the training of dogs for looks : they claim that trying to narrow the head of the German shepherd dog, to make it look aristocratic, has the effect of decreasing its brain area and intelligence. Well, when did anybody ever think that the aristocratic among humans are specially intelligent ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Previous to the use of guns in hunting game, Spaniels were much used in bagging mother birds with their broods, or a whole brood of young ducks at one time. The Spaniel by its attitude showed where to spread the net, and was generally inside the net with the birds. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font6">first called &quot;setting Spaniels’’, they finally came to be called “setters”. The Irish setter has the reputation of being able to hypnotize its prey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Among the Little Fellows and the Mongrels</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can't all be big dogs and thoroughbreds: some of us have to be content to be small or medium-sized and mongrels; and it is so with dogs. The English mastiff sometimes weighs 170 pounds. On the other hand there are dogs so tiny that they can sleep in a vase, notably the Brussels griffon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pug dog is not a beauty, not a fighter nor a racer, and his turned-up nose makes it hard for him to breathe, yet he has his friends. The Black Schipperke is of a jealous disposition: if you have him in the house you may have no other pets. He is born without a tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wire-hair terrier is described as a whole lot of dogs wrapped up in one hide, an actor, a trickster, a clown, a tragedian, a warrior, and a friend. He is described as buoyant, bossy, smart, obtuse, a blue ribbon winner, and a mutt, interesting and compelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pomeranian or German Spitz has been known since prehistoric times. Though of insignificant stature, he is of great courage and dignity. In Italy he is called the Volpino; in France, the Lulu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Mexican Chihuahua, dating from the Spanish court of Isabella, is a diminutive, spindly, prominent-eyed dog, affectionate and benign. The Scottish Cairn terriers trace their ancestry back to about 1G00. There is a dog in Abyssinia that has webbed feet, specially suitable for running in the sand. In the Maritzburg museum is a three-year-old brown and white pointer which never grew to be more than 6} inches from nose to tail-tip. The head was inches wide and 1 inch long; the hind legs were slightly less than 2 inches long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chinese give very nice names to their dogs, of which the following are specimens :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Aye Shing—loving heart; Chu-Jen—the master; Chin-Pao—golden treasure; Fwo-Kin —parti-color dog; Ho Yan—a fine fellow; Kum-Sum—golden hearted; Kwai-Chu—foreign jewel ; Kwai-Wha—little lady; Shoh-Dee—little brother; Shih Bah—snow white; Shia-Kin— little dog; Tu-Sheng Tzu—only child; Tay Yiang ■—sunshine; and Yau-Dan—friend of man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford at Toronto</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font6">REVENTED from hearing Judge Rutherford over Canadian radio stations, 14,000 citizens of Toronto and vicinity heard him at Maple Leaf Gardens and listened intently while he told them what the Word of God has to say about the present world situation. Resounding applause at the conclusion of the talk expressed their appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the convention of which the above public gathering was a part, thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses visited Toronto homes, going over the city three times during the period of the convention, and left w<sup>T</sup>ith the people an abundance of Bible literature written by Judge Rutherford. In their contact with the people they learned that the Radio Commission which excluded Judge Rutherford from the air in Canada is not held in very high esteem. The opinion was frequently expressed that the Commission seemed to consider the wishes and preferences of the people last of all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font6">NE signing “Truth Seeker” wants to know what the Creator wins by letting the little Hendricks boy (of Wilkes-Barre) slowly turn to stone. A. Mastrian, in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News, </span><span class="font6">says: “It’s just to test the faith, Truth Seeker, of faithless creatures like you.” But we remind both that our Lord when on earth declared these afflictions, resting so heavily on all mankind, are from the Devil, the hater of the Creator, and intended by him to bring dishonor to the Creator’s name. Let both look up the passage where the Lord referred to the poor woman “whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years” (Luke 13:11-17) and leave the Creator out of it. When He gets ready to rise up for a witness to His own great and pure and holy name at Armageddon, He will make an end of Satan and all Satan’s works, and then the little Wilkes-Barre lad, and all the rest of earth’s unfortu-notes, including Truth Seeker and Mastrian (if they will have it so), will come into their own. then the poor wild creatures are brought together and teased until a brutal life-and-death struggle follows. The public are getting so used to these scenes of brutality that little tots now cheer when they see these unfortunate creatures of man’s misgovernment writhing in their death agonies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“We do not know where we are going, or why, and we have almost given up the attempt to find out. We are in despair because the keys which were to open the gates of heaven have let us into a larger, but more oppressive prison house. We think those keys were science and the free intelligence of man. They have failed us. We have long since cast off God. To what can we now appeal?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What the Mortgage Guarantee Companies Forgot </span><span class="font6">THE fourteen mortgage guarantee companies that were taken over by the New York state department of insurance had a good idea. They persuaded investors that money invested with them was absolutely safe, in good times and in bad—it was like an investment in Miami Beach properties—it was impossible to lose—there was too much back of it. Investors were told their money was secured by first mortgages on real estate, and, besides all that, by a bond and mortgage guarantee company with millions in assets. Well, the people that made the Miami Beach promises did not figure on the cyclone from the West Indies, and the mortgage guarantee companies did not figure on the financial cyclone of 1929. In the latter case, they quickly paid out most of their cash in dividends; in one case a company paid out $335 in ten years on stock with a par value of $100, and in another case $226 on stock of similar par value. When the crash came the investors got nothing, and it is doubtful if, in either case, they ever will get anything. When somebody offers to help you make an absolutely safe investment, the best thing to do is to turn on your heel and start to run, shouting “Murder! Robbers! Police!” at every jump.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HDHE New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> which apparently does -*■ not know any more about it than the rest of us, takes a column which starts off with the interesting news, “A further unexplained disappearance of monetary gold, amounting this week to $6,772,000 and for the past three weeks to more than $22,124,000, was disclosed in the weekly statistics of the Federal Reserve System published yesterday.” Probably by the time they have cleaned out the whole pile, the brilliant minds directing America’s financial affairs will have discovered where it all went. Appears that somebody is getting nervous and stowing away in a safe place the gold pieces that were filched from the common people a year ago by an order that had nothing back of it but bluff.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The Government pays us bankers a dole every month. My little dole amounts to four or five thousand dollars a month. Not much, but acceptable. We buy bonds, and don’t have to pay for them. We put up 5 percent of the total amount. Then we keep the bonds and can issue money against them. Thus, by paying fifty thousand dollars on account of a million dollars’ worth of bonds, I am allowed to keep the balance, nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars, without paying interest on it. Furthermore, I can issue a million dollars of my own currency against those bonds and lend it out for whatever the traffic will bear. If I do that I pay the Government one-half of 1 percent, and as I get 6 or 7 percent within the legal limit, that is no hardship.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">D</span><span class="font6">URING the World War the government had 391,000 horses. A government horse needs to be branded, so it won’t get “lost, strayed or stolen”. One branding iron would brand at least 2,000 horses; but not in war times. No siree! There would not he any money in it. So the government bought one branding iron for each 2 horses that were to be branded. No, that is not a mistake. And the government wanted good ones, so it had them made of copper, because copper is more expensive. None of the branding irons were finished before the war itself came to an end, but the man who got the branding-iron contract accepted $40,000 in cash in lieu of the profits he would have made. Also, he had 20,000 pounds of copper left on his hands. The government bought that from him at 39^c per pound and sold it back to him at 11c per pound. The government took good care of those horses. They were brushed with 1,637,197 brushes; that is over 4 brushes to each horse, the idea being that a fresh one could be used on each leg. Then the horses had to be covered, and that took 2,029,418 horse covers; that is over 5 to a horse; styles are liable to change and a cover for a horse that would be all right for a June wedding would never do for a November funeral. All the halters that were made for these 391,000 horses were 2,850,835; that is only a little more than 7 to each horse— one for each day in the week. Why should a horse wear one halter all the week when he can have a fresh one every day from Sunday to Saturday inclusive, right down the line ’</span></p>

A railroad fireman who borrowed $25 signed a note for $30, of which $15 was due in 5 days and $15 in 20 days. When he could not pay exactly as stipulated he was sued in the name of a woman to whom the note was said to have been sold, and before he got out of the tangle he had to pay $52.50. If a thing like this (and this is merely one sample of many) can go on right in the national capital, what kind of conditions prevail back in the sticks?

No one, except some salaried advocate of the present regime, would seriously contend that the pressing of pants in Florida, or the sale of milk in New York, is in any sense interstate commerce.”</span></p>

Five Russian queen bees have recently been imported into Ohio with the express hope and expectation that their progeny will make Ohio red clover seed more fertile.</span></p>

A motor caravan arrived here from Bellary which has toured almost all over India, and before passing on from here a series of lectures were given by means of a machine referred to by those in charge as an “electrical transcription’<sup>-</sup> machine, which worked upon the principle of electrical amplification. These lectures, one of the occupants of the caravan told me, were recently given in America by Judge Rutherford by radio, and, while being broadcast, were recorded by the latest electrical process, and are now being reproduced by hundreds of these machines all over the world. At present there are only three such machines in India, but there is every hope of more arriving in the near future.</span></p>

The uneducated classes were greatly mystified upon hearing music and speech proceed from the amplifier. Asked about their work, these people said that their activities are confined solely to preaching. They have no intentions of starting another sect, and seek neither followers nor assistance, but they urge upon all the need of studying the Bible in the light of present-day affairs. In the lectures, Judge Rutherford said the clergy and missionaries. both Catholic and Protestant, have proved unfaithful to God.</span></p>

On that basis, the church that was at the house of Priscilla and Aquila must have been a feeble church. The apostle says of these workers: “Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus: who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. Likewise greet the church that is in their house.” (Romans 16: 3-5) The trouble with our civilization is that it has too few of such apostolically “feeble churches” and too many of the financially “strong” ones. What is needed are churches where every member is willing to lay down his neck for what he believes. The apostle was like that, himself.

How surprised he will be when he learns that instead of the parable of the sheep and goats being thus fulfilled it is even now in process of fulfilment, and all nations are marching to the battle of the last great day, including the American nation, without many of them even knowing what the Dead sea looks like. The dominie should read Judge Rutherford’s books and get it straight.</span></p>

It has been suggested that the supposed thief probably felt that a shirt should be washed and fumigated at least once every hundred years, and that the “holy year” would be just the right time for a cleaning. Or perhaps he was a comparatively honest soul who felt that Christ's name had been dishonored by this racket long enough.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">RMAGEDDON means the place of assembly of Jehovah’s troops, and hence is the name of the place of battle. Soon there will be a great fight by Jesus and His force on one side, against Satan and his force on the other side. That is the final war and in the Scriptures is called “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief reason for the battle of Armageddon is this: to vindicate the name of Jehovah; and this can be done only by destroying wickedness. Satan wickedly challenged Jehovah to put men on earth who would remain true to Him, declaring that God could not establish amongst men a government that would be righteous. God has given Satan many centuries to prove his boastful challenge, and now, the time limit being up, he must be ousted. Jehovah has brought forth His righteous King, Christ Jesus, and placed Him as ruler of the world. Satan refuses to vacate and give up his rule among wicked men and angels. Therefore God will execute Satan and all of his wicked host that are associated with Satan, including all those on earth that work wickedness. Many wicked angels, who are invisible to human eyes, are associated with the Devil, and on earth Satan has many representatives who rule the nations under him. Satan’s earthly representatives are made up of three elements, according to the Scriptures: religious, political and commercial; and together they constitute the visible part of Satan’s organization. All of these selfish and wicked ones hate Jehovah’s witnesses; hence Jesus says to these witnesses : “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” Satan and his host hate everyone who takes his stand on the side of God; hence it is written that Satan is gathering all the nations and rulers of the world unto the ‘battle of the great day of God Almighty’ with the hope and expectation of destroying those who are on God’s side. (Rev. 16:14-16) The prophecy of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zechariah gives a detailed description of the preparation for this great battle, and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font6"> makes the whole matter clear. It is to your great interest to acquaint yourself with what is contained in that book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fighting in that battle will be chiefly by unseen warriors, that is, Satan and all of his host of wicked angels which constitute the invisible part of his army. On earth there will be found on Satan’s side the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Federal Council of Churches, and various other religious organizations which operate for selfish gain, and which will be associated with the great men of commerce who use their money and power to oppress the people, and also the professional politicians who do the bidding of Big Business. Together with this unholy alliance will be joined the police power and army and navy, otherwise designated the “strong-arm squad”. All of these will be without faith in God and His King, and they will all boast of their own power. On the side of Jehovah will be the Lord Jesus and His host of holy angels constituting His army. In the Lord’s army will be found a little company of Jehovah’s witnesses, visible to human eyes, and the only part that they will perform in that day of battle will be to sing the praises of Jehovah and His kingdom. God will give the command, and Christ Jesus will begin the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The result of that battle will be the greatest trouble ever known since the world began, and the greatest loss of human life. There will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">such a terrible slaughter, and the dead will be so numerous, that the survivors cannot bury them. In that battle the religious leaders, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the principal men of their flocks, will find </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font6">way of escape, but all of which shall fall and be crushed to pieces. The tw<sup>T</sup>enty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah, verses 33-36, gives a brief description of that terrible fight. The wicked rule of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan </span><span class="font6">will be destroyed, and that will be the end of all war and tribulation on earth. The new ruler, Christ Jesus, having destroyed the wicked rule, shall put in full operation His government of righteousness, all to the good of men and to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Christ it is written: 'The government shall be upon His shoulder; He shall be called the Mighty Counselor, The Prince of Peace; and His government shall never end.’ You should learn more about that righteous government and receive its blessings.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Lord’s Coming to His Temple</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">OLOMON the king had been on the throne of Israel for more than three years before he began the construction of the temple to Jehovah God at Jerusalem. “And it came to pass, in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the fourth year</span><span class="font6"> of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord.” (1 Kings 6:1) The Lord fixed the month Abib, afterwards called Nisan, for the beginning of the year, which is in the spring of the year, and corresponds usually with the month of April according to our present method of calculating time. (Exodus 12:2; Nehemiah 2:1) Zif was the next month following, which fixes the time above mentioned as in the spring of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, or approximately three and one-half years after his reign began. The temple was erected on Mount Moriah, in the city of Jerusalem. (2 Chronicles 3:1) The stones for the building were made ready before they were brought to the place of the building. (1 Kings 6:7) This temple was destroyed by fire at the hands of the army of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the year 606 B.C., and the Jews were carried away captive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acting by authority and proclamation of a decree made 70 years later by King Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon, the Jews returned to Jerusalem and began the rebuilding of the temple. The leaders in such work were Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest. Hundreds of years later this temple was removed, and a new building constructed. Herod the Great, then the ruler of Palestine, had the material prepared and began the construction of the house in the nineteenth year of his reign, and the building was completed several years later. It was the temple built by Herod that Jesus visited a few days before His crucifixion and out of which He drove the thieves with a whip made of cords. Concerning this Matthew 21:12,13 states: “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Coming to the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There cannot be the slightest doubt that the temple built by Solomon prophetically foretold the building of the real temple or royal house of Jehovah God. The temple built by Zerubbabel, and that built by Herod, took the place of Solomon’s temple and served the same purpose. It was this last temple wherein Jesus taught the people. (Luke 19:47,48) That this temple was prophetic of the real temple of God is shown by words of Jesus himself when He drove the clergy of the Jews from that temple and said to them: “Take these things from hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. . . . Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But lie spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.”—John 2:15-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus himself is the Chief Corner Stone or Head Stone of the royal temple of Jehovah God. Jesus told the Jewish clergy as much: “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.” (Matthew 21:42-44) This is fully supported by the words of the apostle Paul, at Ephesians 2:18-22, addressed to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who are made members of “the church, which is his body”. (Ephesians 1: 22, 23) These scriptures and the facts warrant us in comparing certain things concerning the prophetic temple with what Jesus, the Head of the real temple, does. Solomon prepared the stones and other material for the temple and brought them together and erected the building without a great noise. “And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house while it was in building.” (1 Kings 6:7) The real or royal temple of God is made of “living stones”, that is to say, living creatures represented by stones, of which Christ Jesus is the Chief Stone. As 1 Peter 2:3-6 states: “If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The temple made of these living stones constitutes the royal house or royal priesthood and holy nation of Jehovah God. (1 Peter 2:9,10) These living stones were in course of selection and preparation from the day that Jesus selected His disciples until the time of His second coming to gather together unto himself those who constitute the temple class. These living stones, which constitute the real temple, are brought together and erected into a building of God without noise or ostentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Time of Coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the fall of the year 29 (A.D.), according to the Scriptures, Jesus was immersed by John the baptizer and was shortly thereafter anointed by the spirit of Jehovah God as His appointed King, earth’s rightful ruler. (Luke 3:21-23; 4:1-21) In the spring of the year 33, or in the fourth year after His anointing, Jesus, seated on an ass, rode into Jerusalem and went to the temple and cleansed it. Note, then, the comparison: Solomon began work on the temple in the fourth year of his reign, and in the spring of the year. Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Solomon, in the fourth year after He was anointed to be King and Head of Jehovah’s temple class, and in the spring of the year, offered himself as King and as the Chief Corner Stone in the temple of God and was rejected by the Jews and shortly thereafter was crucified. It was three and one-half years, therefore in the fourth year, after His anointing, that He thus in a small way fulfilled the prophecy made by Solomon in connection with the beginning of the prophetic temple. The greater fulfilment of that prophecy must be after the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the year 1922 it has been publicly declared that the Lord Jesus came to God’s true temple in the year 1918. Many ask: Since no one has seen Him present with the naked human eye, how can it be proved that He came as an invisible spirit to the temple in that year? Note now the proof:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few days before His crucifixion the disciples came out of the temple of Jerusalem with Jesus. They were talking to Him about the temple. “And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” (Matthew 24: 2) Evidently in this same conversation Jesus had told them something about raising up the temple of Uis body at His second coming. It was then that they propounded the question: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign [proof] of thy coming, and of the end of the world [age]?” (Matthew 24:3) Jesus’ answer then given is important in fixing the date. He told His disciples what would be the sign of the end of the world, which would mean the end of Satan’s rule of the earth without divine interference and w<sup>r</sup>ould mean the beginning of the rule of Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King. He said to them that the first sorrows that would come upon Satan’s organization would be the world war, followed by famine, pestilence and earthquakes; that then there would follow “distress of nations, with perplexity”. The end of the world would necessarily mark the time when Jehovah God would place Jesus upon His throne. (Psalm 2:1-6) That which Jesus told His disciples concerning the end of the world began to have its fulfilment, as is well known from the facts, in the autumn season of 1914, with the beginning of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zedekiah was the last Jewish king to rule in Jerusalem. To him were the words of Ezekiel 21:25-27 addressed: “Thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” No doubt Jesus’ disciples were familiar with this prophecy and would naturally be looking forward to the time when it would be fulfilled and when He would “come whose right it is”. They would know that in some future time this prophecy must be fulfilled. Jehovah’s decree pronounced against Zedekiah, as stated by Ezekiel, was enforced in the year 606 B.C., when the temple built by Solomon was destroyed. Other scriptures show that from 606 B.C. until ‘the coming of him whose right it is’ would be a period of seven “times”, symbolic of three hundred and sixty years each, or a total period of twenty-five hundred and twenty years; and therefore such period of time would necessarily end in 1914. (Leviticus 26:18) Such is further proof that in the autumn season of 1914 is the correct time for Jesus Christ to take His power and to begin to exercise it over earthly things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The primary purpose of Jesus’ second coming is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. When Jesus by the power of Jehovah was raised from the dead and exalted into the heaven, no doubt He was then anxious to immediately begin the vindication work. He was then told by His Father that He must wait until God’s due time in which to begin it: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Psalm 110:1) “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.” (Hebrews 10:12,13) The end of that period of time of waiting must of necessity be the same as the end of the time of waiting mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel in chapter 21, verse 27. Both of these prophecies would mark the time when Jehovah would send forth His King whose right it is to rule. In the words of Psalm 2: 6, 8: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen [the nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hence the taking of power by the Lord Jesus is also the taking of power by Jehovah God over things pertaining to the earth. Revelation 11: 17,18 pictures the faithful servants of Jehovah as speaking: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” It was in the autumn of 1914 that the nations became angry, which was further proof of the fact that Christ Jesus ■was then placed upon His throne. The Revelation then follows the above with the statement that ‘the temple in heaven was opened, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament’. (Revelation 11:19) The ark of the testament or covenant symbolically represents Jehovah's presence and is therefore proof that Christ Jesus had come to the temple as chief representative of Jehovah and hence Jehovah himself was representatively present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Solomon began building the temple in the fourth year of his reign, and as Jesus came and offered himself three and one-half years after His anointing as King, we should expect that the second coming of the Lord Jesus to the spiritual temple of Jehovah would be in the fourth year, to wit, three and one-half years after the beginning of His reign in 1914, and that therefore the time for His coming to the temple would be in the spring of A.D. 1918. This date is fully supported by the events that came to pass in 1918; which facts exactly fit the prophecy concerning His coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the express will of God that Christ Jesus should do a preparatory work before coming to His temple. This is described by Malachi the prophet of God as a 'preparing of the way before the Lord&quot;. Historical facts show that for forty years prior to 1918 there was a work carried on by God’s people within the realms of “Christendom”, which work restored to God’s people those primary truths which had long been hidden from them. During that period of time the true followers of Christ Jesus forsook Satan's organization and devoted themselves entirely to the Lord God. This, designated as the “Elijah work”, was the work of Christ Jesus in preparing the way before Jehovah, which work must be done before Uis coming to God’s temple; as Malachi 3:1 declares: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Purpose of Coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above text, Malachi 3:1, proves conclusively the fact of Jesus’ coming as Jehovah’s Messenger to His temple. The purpose of His coming to the temple of Jehovah is to execute judgment as the great Judge. This must take place before the battle of Armageddon; and since all members of the true church, “his body,” must be judged by Him, it must take place before the last members are taken from the earth. Furthermore, He must examine the facts as to the things that are to be judged. It conclusively follows, then, that the Lord’s coming to His temple must be while some of the faithful of the Lord are yet in the flesh. During the time that Jehovah’s Messenger, Christ Jesus, was preparing the way before Jehovah the interests of God’s kingdom were committed to those who had make a covenant to do God’s will and who had been invited to a place in the Kingdom. As to their faithfulness in giving attention to these Kingdom interests the Lord must consider the facts before choosing and approving them. It is written: “Judgment must begin at the house of God.” (1 Peter 4:17) That judgment must determine the faithfulness of God’s people up to that period of time. The judgment is a time of fiery tests, that is to say, tests that try one as though by fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the purpose of the Lord’s coming to His temple Malachi 3: 2, 3 prophesies: “But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” From the typical sons of Levi the Jewish priests were selected, and from the antitypical “sons of Levi” the members of Jehovah's royal priesthood are taken and made members of the royal house of God. The Levites picture all who are consecrated to God and begotten of His spirit, some of whom become priests (not of an earthly religious organization, however) and others of whom go to make up the “great multitude” who serve Jehovah God other than as priests in His temple day and night. (Revelation 7:9-17) It is quite clear from the words of the prophet Malachi that the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple would be marked by severe trials which would result in separating the disapproved from those who are approved, in order that the approved ones might render faithful service to God in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Physical facts, or the events that came to pass in the spring of 1918, exactly corroborate the other testimony that 1918, in the spring of the year, marks the time of Jesus’ coming to the temple of Jehovah. It was at that time that there came upon the consecrated people of God a fiery trial. These had been for some time doing the work of proclaiming the truth. It was in that year that the work we designate the “Elijah work” of the true church was killed, which event was pictured by the prophet Elijah’s being taken away heavenward by a fiery chariot and whirlwind and also pictured by the beheading of John the baptizer. (2 Kings 2:9-13; Matthew 14:1-13; 17:10-13) Many of the Lord’s witnesses throughout the land were at that time imprisoned because of their faithful stand for Jehovah God and His kingdom during the World War; and many others restrained of their liberty of action as to giving testimony publicly and from house to house in the name of the Lord. It was in that time that many false brethren arose in the congregations, who had professed to be followers of Christ Jesus but whose love then grew cold, and they turned against others who were serving God and His kingdom. It was, too, in that time that God’s people were hated of all nations because of their faithfulness to the Lord, even as Jesus had foretold would come to pass after the beginning of the end of the world, saying: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And because iniquity [lawlessness] shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” —Matthew 24: 9,10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These prophetic utterances, together with the events that have come to pass from and after 1918 and which fit the prophecy and hence show a fulfilment, prove that the Lord must come to the temple of Jehovah for judgment, and that He did come to the temple in the spring of 1918. That His coming is for the purpose of judging, and that the angels accompanying Him would carry out His orders, is shown by His words at Matthew 25:31: “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.” At this time of judgment at the temple the Lord Jesus directs His angels to carry out this separating work; as He declared at Matthew 13: 41: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.” “Offend,” as used in this text, applies to those who set snares for the gullible for the purpose of catching them and drawing them away after themselves. “Iniquity” means “lawlessness”, and applies to those who would do a work in an unlawful way and contrary to what the Lord has directed. Such ones the angels gather out; therefore they must once have been in line for the Kingdom by reason of having responded to the call to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle Paul warned against the same thing, declaring that this false class would arise chiefly amongst the elected “elders” of the congregations. He said: “Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.” (Acts 20: 30) This is the class that cause divisions amongst the Lord’s true people and commit such offense for a selfish reason. (Romans 16:17,18) The facts show that from and after 1918 these very things did come to pass. A number of those who had been prominent in God’s service during the “Elijah work” drew away in 1918 and since have done everything within their power to draw others away with them, and these now oppose Jehovah’s witnesses in their work of advertising Jehovah’s King and the Kingdom. These events the Lord declared would occur following the time of His appearing “as the lightning” at His temple; and the facts show that they began to come to pass in the spring of 1918, proving that to be the date of His appearing at the temple.—Matthew 24: 24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The joy of the Lord is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Christ Jesus is the Vindicator. He was compelled to wait until 1914 to begin this work of vindication. When He was placed upon the throne, in 1914, Jehovah directed Him to proceed immediately to rule amongst the enemy. (Psalms 2:6; 110: 2) His first work was to cast Satan out of heaven and down to the earth, and then to prepare for the final battle, which is Armageddon, and in which Satan’s organization will be destroyed. (Revelation 12: 5-12) Those on earth found faithful and whom He approved He invited into His temple and to enter into the joy of the Lord and have a part in proclaiming God’s judgment against Satan’s organization, as illustrated in His parable of the talents. (Matthew 25:14-30) These faithful approved ones are “thy people” who “shall be willing in the day of thy power”. (Psalm 110: 3) The facts show fulfilment of these prophetic utterances in that after 1918 Christ’s faithful followers did enter into the “joy of the Lord” (Nehemiah 8:10) and they now delight themselves in telling the people concerning Satan’s organization and God’s organization and that God’s purpose is to soon destroy the wicked organization in vindication of His name. These rejoice to tell of Jehovah and His works and make known His kingdom: “and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” So said Jesus in His prophecy relating to His coming to the temple. (Matthew 24:14) His anointed followers are commanded to proclaim the “day of vengeance of our God” and to “comfort all that mourn”. (Isaiah 61:1,2) This is exactly what Jehovah’s “faithful and wise servant” class on earth has been doing since the coming of the Lord to His temple, and these are the only ones who have been doing His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judgment began at the house of God. Shortly thereafter judgment came upon the religious systems of so-called “Christians” known as “organized Christianity”. The prophet Isaiah had a vision of the Lord in His temple, and the circumstances mentioned by him fix the time thereof. (Isaiah 6:1) King Uzziah, whom he mentions, clearly foreshadowed “organized Christianity”, particularly its rulers and leaders. King Uzziah presumptuously acted as a priest in offering incense in God's temple at Jerusalem, and for this was stricken with leprosy fatally. During the World War “organized Christianity” was furnished with ample proof of the Lord's presence and the beginning of His kingdom. Some of their clergy even issued a manifesto calling attention to these facts and spread that manifesto throughout the earth. In 1919 “organized Christianity”, like Uzziah, presumptuously put herself in the position of priest and erected the League of Nations in place of Jehovah's.kingdom under Christ, and hailed that League as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, thereby rejecting the true King, Christ Jesus, the Chief Corner Stone of Jehovah’s royal temple, and who had now come to the temple and offered himself as earth’s King. For this “organized Christianity” has been smitten and will never recover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of which foregoing evidence proves that the Lord came, invisibly, to His temple in the year 1918 for judgment.</span></p>

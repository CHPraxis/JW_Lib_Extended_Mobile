<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When we reach perfection, we will always be able to please Jehovah in everything we do. In the meantime, we need to keep working hard toward that goal. Notice the connection Paul made between making our mind over and discerning God’s will, as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>. Instead of passively allowing ourselves to be molded by this system of things, we must first examine ourselves to determine how much we are letting God’s thinking​—not the world’s—​influence our goals and decisions.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How can we examine our thinking about the nearness of the day of Jehovah? (See picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Consider an example. Jehovah wants us to “keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:12-61:3:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:12</a>) Ask yourself: ‘Does my way of life show that I understand how close we are to the end of this system of things? Do my decisions regarding education and employment show that serving Jehovah is the most important thing in my life? Do I have faith that Jehovah will provide for me and my family, or do I constantly worry about material things?’ Think how pleased Jehovah is when he sees us bringing our life into harmony with his will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:25-27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:12-50:4:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Phil. 4:12, 13</a>.</p>

It also involves our thinking, our inclinations, and our motives. So we need to keep making our mind over by reading God’s Word, learning to think as he thinks, and then doing whatever is necessary to bring ourselves in line with Jehovah’s will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:14-46:2:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:14-16</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>“PUT ON THE NEW PERSONALITY”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31, 32</a>, what else do we need to do, and why might this be challenging?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 4:31, 32</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Besides making changes in our thinking, we need to “put on the new personality.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:24-49:4:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 4:24</a>) That involves action on our part. Among other things, we must work hard to overcome such personality traits as malicious bitterness, anger, and wrath. Why might that be challenging? Because some negative personality traits are deep-rooted. For example, the Bible says that some people are <strong><em>“prone</em></strong> to anger” and <strong><em>“disposed</em></strong> to rage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:22-20:29:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 29:22</a>) Controlling ingrained traits will likely require continual effort even after baptism, as the following experience shows.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>8-9.</strong> How does Stephen’s experience show the need to keep putting away the old personality?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> A brother named Stephen had a problem with controlling his anger. “Even after I was baptized,” he says, “I had to keep working on my temper. For example, on one occasion while going from house to house in the Christian ministry, I chased after a thief who had just stolen the radio from my car. As I got closer to him, he dropped the radio and ran away. When I related to the others with me how I got my radio back, an elder in the group asked me, ‘Stephen, what would you have done if you had caught up with him?’ That question made me think and motivated me to keep working at being peaceable.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> As Stephen’s experience illustrates, a negative personality trait can come to the surface unexpectedly, even after we thought we had it under control. If that happens to you, do not be discouraged and do not conclude that you have failed as a Christian. Even the apostle Paul admitted: “When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-23</a>) All imperfect Christians have to deal with negative traits that keep coming back like dust and dirt that accumulate in our home. We need to keep working at remaining clean. How can we do that?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> How can we fight undesirable traits? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 John 5:14, 15</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Pray to Jehovah about the trait that you are struggling with, confident that he will hear you and help you. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 5:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> While Jehovah will not miraculously eliminate the trait, he can strengthen you so that you do not give in to it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:10</a>) Meanwhile, work in harmony with your prayers by not feeding inclinations of the old personality. For example, be cautious about <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>watching movies, watching television programs, or reading stories that glorify personality traits that you are trying to eliminate. And do not let your mind dwell on improper desires.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:2-51:3:2" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Col. 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What steps can we take to keep putting on the new personality?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Although you have put away the old personality, it is important to cultivate the new one. How can you do that? Make it a goal to imitate Jehovah as you learn about his qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1, 2</a>) For example, when you read a Bible account that highlights Jehovah’s forgiveness, ask yourself, ‘Do I forgive others?’ When you read about Jehovah’s compassion for those who have fallen on hard times, ask yourself, ‘Do I have similar concern for fellow believers who are in need, and do I show it by my actions?’ Keep making your mind over by putting on the new personality, and be patient with yourself as you do so.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How did Stephen experience the transforming power of the Bible?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Stephen, mentioned earlier, found that he was gradually able to put on the new personality. He says: “Since baptism, I have faced a number of potentially explosive situations. I’ve learned either to walk away from people who are trying to provoke me or to defuse the situation in other ways. Many people, including my wife, have commended me on how I have handled these situations. I’ve even surprised myself! I do not take credit for these changes in my personality. Rather, I believe that they are testimony to the transforming power of the Bible.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong> What will help us to cultivate proper desires? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16</a>)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Galatians 5:16</strong></a><strong>.</strong> To help us win the fight to do what is right, Jehovah generously provides his holy spirit. When we study God’s Word, we are placing ourselves under the influence of that spirit. We also receive holy spirit when we attend our meetings. At those Christian gatherings, we can spend time with brothers and sisters who, like us, are trying hard to do what is right, and that is encouraging. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 13:7</a>) And when we approach Jehovah in earnest prayer and beg him for help with some weakness, he will give us his holy spirit to strengthen us to keep fighting. While these activities will probably not make wrong desires disappear, they will help us resist the urge to act on those desires. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16</a> says, those who walk by spirit “will <strong><em>carry out</em></strong> no fleshly desire.”</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> Why is it important to <strong><em>keep</em></strong> cultivating proper desires?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Once we have established a wholesome routine of spiritual activities, it is essential that we maintain that routine and <strong><em>keep</em></strong> cultivating proper desires. Why? Because one of our enemies never sleeps. That enemy is the temptation to do what is wrong. Even after baptism we might find ourselves attracted to the very things that we should avoid, including gambling, alcohol abuse, or pornography. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eph. 5:3, 4</a>) A young Christian brother admits: “One of the most difficult things I have struggled with is my attraction to the same sex. I thought <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>that it was just a phase, but those feelings still plague me.” What can help you if an improper desire is especially strong?</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> Why is it encouraging to know that improper desires are “common to men”? (See picture.)</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> As you contend with an improper desire that is proving to be a crafty opponent, remember that you are not alone. The Bible says: “No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13a</a>) Another translation renders the passage this way: “No temptation has overtaken you that is unusual for human beings.” That statement was directed to male and female Christians living in Corinth. Some had formerly been adulterers, homosexuals, and drunkards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9-11</a>) Do you think that after their baptism they never had any improper desires to contend with? That could not be the case. They were all anointed Christians, true, but they were still imperfect humans. No doubt they had to struggle with improper desires from time to time. That should be encouraging to us. Why? Because it shows that whatever improper desire you are battling, someone else has resisted it. Indeed, you can remain “firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong> What pitfall should we avoid, and why?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Avoid the pitfall of thinking that no one else can understand the particular challenge that you are facing. Thinking that way could lead you to conclude that your situation is hopeless and that you are powerless to resist improper desires. The Bible says otherwise. It states: “God <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13b</a>) Therefore, even when an improper desire is strong, we <strong><em>can</em></strong> successfully endure it. With Jehovah’s help, we <strong><em>can</em></strong> keep from acting on it.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong> Although we may not be able to keep improper desires from surfacing, what can we control?</p>

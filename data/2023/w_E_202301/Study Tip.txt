Do you like reading the life stories of our brothers and sisters?

A couple who read one life story every morning say: “What joy and encouragement these stories have brought to us! They remind us that we too can be faithful under all circumstances.” A sister who feels similarly wrote: “These life stories are comforting, moving, and heartwarming. The lives of our brothers and sisters are full of purpose and meaning. Their stories motivate me to do more in the ministry and help me to lead my children in the path of full-time service to Jehovah.”
Life stories can motivate you to pursue meaningful goals, to overcome weaknesses, and to endure severe trials with joy and dignity. How can you find these stories?

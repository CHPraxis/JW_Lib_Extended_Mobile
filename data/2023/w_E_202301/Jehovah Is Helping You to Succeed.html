We realize that, as the Bible says, “we must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:22-44:14:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 14:22</a>) We also know that some of our problems will not be completely solved until we are living in God’s new world, where “death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What sudden change took place in Joseph’s life?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The patriarch Jacob made it obvious that he loved his son Joseph very much. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:3-1:37:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 37:3, 4</a>) As a result, Jacob’s older sons became jealous of their brother. When they saw an opportunity, they sold Joseph to a <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>group of Midianite merchants. Those merchants took Joseph hundreds of kilometers away to Egypt, where he was sold once more​—this time to Potiphar, chief of Pharaoh’s guards. How quickly Joseph’s life changed, from being his father’s dearly beloved son to being a lowly slave of an Egyptian!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:1-1:39:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 39:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How might we face a challenge similar to the one Joseph faced?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Bible says that “bad things happen to everyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11</a>, <em>Holy Bible​—Easy-to-Read Version</em>) We sometimes encounter hardships that are “common to men”—​that is, trials that all humans experience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) Or we may suffer simply because we are disciples of Jesus. For example, we might be ridiculed, opposed, or even persecuted because of our faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>) Whatever trial you face, Jehovah can make you successful. How did he do that for Joseph?</p>

Potiphar saw that “Jehovah was making everything that [Joseph] did successful.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Eventually, the Egyptian made Joseph his personal attendant. He also put Joseph in charge of his entire house. The result? Potiphar prospered.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> How might Joseph have felt about his situation?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Try to view the situation from Joseph’s standpoint. What did he want more than anything? Was it to be noticed and rewarded by Potiphar? More likely, Joseph wanted to be freed so that he could return to his father. After all, despite all the privileges he had in Potiphar’s house, Joseph was still a slave who was subject to a pagan master. Jehovah did not cause Potiphar to set Joseph free. And Joseph’s situation was about to become much worse.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> As reported in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:1-1:39:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 39</a>, Potiphar’s wife was attracted to Joseph and repeatedly tried to seduce him. Each time, Joseph refused her advances. Finally, she became so angry with Joseph that she accused him of trying to rape her. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:14-1:39:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 39:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When Potiphar heard of this, he threw Joseph into prison, where he remained for some years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:19-1:39:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 39:19, 20</a>) What was the prison like? The Hebrew word Joseph used for “prison” can mean “cistern,” or “pit,” suggesting that his surroundings were dark and that he felt hopeless. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:15-1:40:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 40:15</a>; ftn.) Also, the Bible indicates that for a time Joseph’s feet were bound in fetters and his neck was put in irons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:17-19:105:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 105:17, 18</a>) Joseph’s situation was going from bad to worse. He went from being a trusted slave to being a lowly prisoner.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> Even if a trial intensifies, of what can we be sure?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Have you ever been in a distressing situation that went from bad to worse despite your earnest prayers? That can happen. Jehovah does not shield us from trials in a world that is ruled by Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Still, you can be sure of this: Jehovah is fully aware of what you are going through, and he cares about you.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:21-1:39:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 39:21-23</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Even during this bleak period of imprisonment, Jehovah made Joseph successful. How? In time, Joseph gained the trust and respect of the chief officer, just as he had done with Potiphar. Before long, the chief officer put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners. In fact, the Bible says that “the chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph’s care.” Joseph now had something to occupy his mind​—productive work. What an unusual development! How could a prisoner who is accused of attempting to rape the wife of a court official be given such a trusted position? There is only one explanation. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:23-1:39:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 39:23</a> states, “Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.”</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> Explain why Joseph might not have felt that he was successful in everything.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Try again to view the situation from Joseph’s standpoint. After being falsely accused and imprisoned, do you think that he felt successful in <strong><em>everything?</em></strong> What did Joseph want more than anything? Was it to gain favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison? More likely, Joseph wanted to be exonerated and set free. He even asked another prisoner who was about to be released to speak to Pharaoh in his behalf in order to get him out of that dreary prison. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:14-1:40:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 40:14</a>) However, the man failed to speak to Pharaoh right away. As a result, Joseph <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>remained in that prison for two more years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:23-1:40:23" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 40:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:1-1:41:1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 41:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:14-1:41:14" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 14</a>) Still, Jehovah continued to make his way successful. How?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What special ability did Jehovah give Joseph, and what role did this play in accomplishing Jehovah’s purpose?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> While Joseph was in prison, Jehovah caused the king of Egypt to have two troubling dreams. Pharaoh desperately wanted to know what they meant. When the king learned that Joseph had the ability to interpret dreams, he sent for him. With Jehovah’s help, Joseph interpreted the dreams and impressed Pharaoh with the practical advice he gave him. Seeing that Jehovah was with the young man, Pharaoh appointed Joseph as the food administrator for all of Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:38-1:41:38" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 41:38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:41-1:41:44" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 41-44</a>) Later, a severe famine arose that affected not only Egypt but also Canaan, the land in which Joseph’s family were living. Joseph was now in a position to save his family and thus preserve the line of descent that would lead to the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> In what ways did Jehovah make Joseph successful?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Think about the unusual events in Joseph’s life. Who caused Potiphar to take special note of Joseph, a mere slave? Who caused the chief officer of the prison to favor Joseph, a lowly prisoner? Who gave Pharaoh troubling dreams and gave Joseph the ability to interpret them? Who was behind the decision to appoint Joseph as the food administrator of Egypt? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:5-1:45:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 45:5</a>) Obviously, it was Jehovah who made everything Joseph did succeed. In the end, Jehovah turned the cruel scheme of Joseph’s brothers into a means by which He could accomplish His will.</p>

No, the Bible does not support that view. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 9:11</a>) However, we do know this: When we face a trial, Jehovah is aware of it and he hears our cries for help.

How?</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong> How does Jehovah help us in times of hardship?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> One way that Jehovah helps us is by providing comfort and encouragement, often just at the right time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3, 4</a>) That was the case for Eziz, a brother in Turkmenistan who was sentenced to two years in prison because of his faith. “On the morning of my trial,” he relates, “a brother showed me <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:15-23:30:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:15</a>, where it says: ‘Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.’ This verse always helped me to stay calm and rely on Jehovah for everything. Meditating on this verse helped me over the entire course of my imprisonment.” Can you think of a time in your life when Jehovah sustained you by providing comfort and encouragement just when you needed it most?</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>15-16.</strong> What do you learn from Tori’s experience?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Often, it is only after we look back on a hardship that we see how Jehovah helped us get through it. A sister named Tori found that to be true. Her son, Mason, battled cancer for six years until he passed away. Understandably, Tori was heartbroken. She says, “I don’t think there could have been a more painful ordeal for me as a mother.” She adds, “I’m sure other parents would agree that seeing <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>your child suffer is worse than experiencing it yourself.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> As devastating as that trial was, however, Tori later reflected on the ways in which Jehovah helped her through it. “In hindsight,” she says, “I can see Jehovah’s loving hand throughout my son’s illness. For example, even when Mason was too sick to see visitors, brothers and sisters would drive two hours to the hospital. There was always someone in the waiting room​—ready and willing to provide support. Also, our material needs were cared for. Even in the worst of times, we never went without.” Jehovah gave Tori what she needed to endure, and he did the same for Mason.​—See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2023242/53-56">Jehovah Gave Us Exactly What We Needed</a>.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">Mason was diagnosed with cancer at age seven, and for the next six years, he courageously fought the disease. Mason had to be hospitalized a number of times during the course of his illness. Yet, those who were in his congregation noticed a pattern. Each time Mason was released from the hospital, he was back in the ministry almost immediately. Mason loved to engage in the ministry for as long as his strength would permit.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sc">When Mason died, more than 700 people attended his memorial service, including many of his schoolmates and teachers. One teacher who visited him shortly before his death said that she wanted her children to have the kind of faith that Mason had. She also said that she had not been contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses in the five years she had been living in the area. The next day she was contacted at her home by the Witnesses. The teacher agreed to attend a congregation meeting.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">Tori, Mason’s mother, says: “Jehovah didn’t miraculously heal Mason, and sometimes that thought prevented me from seeing how Jehovah was making our way successful. But he was. Jehovah gave us exactly what we needed when we needed it.”</p>

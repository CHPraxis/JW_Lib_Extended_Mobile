<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN we lose a loved one in death, we miss that person so much! At first, we may feel nothing but pain when we think back to the days leading up to his death, especially if our loved one suffered before dying. With time, however, we begin to feel a measure of joy when we think of something he taught us or something he did or said to encourage us or to make us smile.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In a similar way, it saddens us to read about Jesus’ suffering and death. During the Memorial season, we especially take time to reflect on the significance of his ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:24-46:11:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:24, 25</a>) However, we find great joy in reflecting on all the things Jesus said and did while he was on earth. We also find it stimulating to think about what he is doing now and what he will do for us in the future. Meditating on these things and on his love for us can move us to show our appreciation in practical ways, as we will see in this article.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Consider the example of a Jewish woman named Mary Magdalene. She was in a wretched condition, tormented by seven demons. She must have felt that there was no way out. So imagine how thankful she was when Jesus freed her from the influence of those demons! Her gratitude moved her to become his follower and to use her time, energy, and belongings to support him in the ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:1-42:8:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 8:1-3</a>) Although Mary deeply appreciated what Jesus did for her personally, she may not have grasped that his greatest gift was yet to come. He would give his life in behalf of humankind, “so that everyone exercising faith in him” could enjoy everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Still, Mary showed her appreciation for Jesus by being loyal.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:25-43:19:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 19:25</a>) After Jesus died, Mary and two other women brought spices to the tomb for his burial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:1-41:16:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 16:1, 2</a>) Mary’s loyalty was richly rewarded.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:21-62:4:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 4:21</a>) We take a personal interest in them and support them during their trials.

We strive to imitate Jehovah’s example of forgiveness. If Jehovah was willing to let his Son die for our sins, should we not readily forgive our brothers and sisters when they sin against us? We would not want to be like the wicked slave referred to in one of Jesus’ parables. Even after his master had canceled his enormous debt, that slave failed to forgive a fellow slave’s relatively small debt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:23-40:18:35" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 18:23-35</a>) If you have had a misunderstanding with someone in the congregation, could you take the first step to make peace before attending the Memorial?

After denying Jesus three times, Peter was likely desperate to prove that he loved Jesus. Following his resurrection, Jesus asked Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” We can be sure that Peter would have done anything to prove his love for his Master. Jesus told Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:17" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 21:15-17</a>) And for the rest of his life, Peter tenderly cared for the Lord’s sheep, proving that he had love for Jesus.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> On the night before he died, Jesus told his disciples: “In the world you <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>will have tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:32-43:16:33" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>John 16:32, 33</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What helped Jesus to face his enemies with courage and to remain faithful until death? He relied on Jehovah. Knowing that his followers would face similar tests, Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) Why does this give us courage? Because Jehovah is stronger than any of our enemies.

He was well-regarded by Jewish society. He was a member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish supreme court. However, during Jesus’ earthly ministry, Joseph was anything but courageous.

No doubt he was afraid that he would lose his prestigious position in the community. Whatever the case, the Bible tells us that after Jesus died, Joseph finally “took courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:42-41:15:43" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 15:42, 43</a>) Joseph’s support of Jesus was now no longer a secret.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>MANY today are suffering from a lack of confidence. They do not know whom they can trust. They wonder whether people they look up to​—politicians, scientists, and businessmen—​really have their best interests at heart. In addition, they do not have high regard for Christendom’s clergy. So it is not surprising that they view with skepticism the book those religious leaders claim to represent​—the Bible.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What was involved in copying the Hebrew Scriptures? (See cover picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In order to preserve his inspired message, Jehovah directed that it be copied. He instructed the kings of Israel to make their own copies of the written Law, and he appointed the Levites to teach that Law to the people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:18-5:17:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 17:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:24-5:31:26" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:24-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:7-16:8:7" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Neh. 8:7</a>) After the exile of the Jews to Babylon, a group of professional copyists began to make numerous copies of the Hebrew Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:6-15:7:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6</a>, ftns.) These men were conscientious. Eventually, copyists began to count not only the words but even the letters so as to be sure that everything was accurately transcribed. Even so, because of human imperfection, some small errors crept into the Bible text. However, many copies of the same text were made, so those errors could later be identified. How?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> How could errors in copies of the Bible be identified?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Modern scholars have a reliable way to identify errors made by those who copied the Bible text. To illustrate: Suppose 100 men are assigned to copy a page of text by hand. One of the men makes a slight error in his copy. One way we could detect that error is by comparing his copy with all the others. Similarly, by comparing a number of Bible manuscripts, scholars are able to identify errors or omissions that one copyist may have made.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How accurate were many Bible copyists?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Those who copied Bible manuscripts took pains to do so accurately. Consider an example that proves this point. The oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Scriptures dates back to 1008 or 1009 C.E. It is called the Leningrad Codex. In recent times, however, a number of Bible manuscripts and fragments have been discovered that are about 1,000 years older than the Leningrad Codex. Someone might think that after those manuscripts were copied and recopied over a period of 1,000 years, the text of the Leningrad Codex would bear little resemblance to the text of those older manuscripts. Yet, that is not the case. Scholars who compared the earlier manuscripts with the later ones found that despite some relatively slight variations in wording, the substance of the Bible’s message was accurately preserved.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How do copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures compare with copies of some ancient secular texts?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Early Christians followed the tradition of the copyists of the Hebrew Scriptures. They diligently made copies of the 27 books of the Greek Scriptures, which they used at their meetings and in <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>their preaching activities. After comparing surviving manuscripts of the Greek Scriptures with other works of the same time period, one scholar concludes: “As a general rule there are more [copies of the Greek Scriptures], . . . and they tend to be more complete.” The book <em>Anatomy of the New Testament</em> states: “One can be confident that what we read in a responsible modern translation [of the Greek Scriptures] represents substantially what the ancient authors wrote.”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:8-23:40:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:8</a>, what is true regarding the Bible’s message?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> The careful efforts of many copyists over the centuries have contributed to the accuracy of the Bible that we read and study today.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Undoubtedly, it was Jehovah who made sure that his message to mankind would be accurately preserved. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:8-23:40:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 40:8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Of course, some may argue that just because the Bible’s message has been preserved does not prove that it was inspired by God. So let us now consider some evidence of the Bible’s inspiration.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> Give an example of a fulfilled prophecy that confirms the truthfulness of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:21</a>. (See pictures.)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> The Bible contains many prophecies that were fulfilled, some of them hundreds of years after they were recorded. History confirms that these prophecies came true. This does not surprise us because we know that the Author of Bible prophecy is Jehovah. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>2 Peter 1:21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Think of the prophecies regarding the fall of the ancient city of Babylon. In the eighth century B.C.E., the prophet Isaiah was inspired to foretell that the then powerful city of Babylon would be captured. He even gave the name of its conqueror, Cyrus, and foretold precisely how the city would be seized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:27-23:45:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27–45:2</a>) Isaiah also <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>prophesied that Babylon would eventually be destroyed and completely deserted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:19-23:13:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 13:19, 20</a>) That is exactly what happened. Babylon fell to the Medes and the Persians in 539 B.C.E., and the site of this once great city is now a pile of ruins.​—See the video <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-lffv_32_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=32"><em>The Bible Foretold the Fall of Babylon</em></a> in the electronic edition of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1102021203/20-27"><em>Enjoy Life Forever!</em> book, lesson 03 point 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> Describe how <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:41-27:2:43" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Daniel 2:41-43</a> is being fulfilled today.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The fulfillment of Bible prophecy is not just a thing of the past; we are seeing prophecies being fulfilled today. Consider, for example, the remarkable fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy regarding the Anglo-American World Power. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:41-27:2:43" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 2:41-43</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That prophecy accurately predicted that this dual world power would be “partly strong” like iron and “partly fragile” like clay. This has proved to be true. Britain and America have shown ironlike strength, playing a key role in winning both World Wars and continuing to wield great military might. Yet, their power has also been weakened by their citizens, who tend to rise up to claim their rights through labor unions, civil rights campaigns, and independence movements. One expert in world politics recently observed: “There is no advanced industrial democracy in the world more politically divided, or politically dysfunctional, than the United States today.” And Britain, the other part of this world power, has been especially divided in recent years by opposing opinions regarding what ties it should maintain with countries in the European Union. These divisions have made it almost impossible for the Anglo-American World Power to act decisively.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> Of what does Bible prophecy convince us?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The many Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled strengthen our confidence in the reliability of God’s promises for the future. We feel as did the psalmist who prayed to Jehovah: “I long for your salvation, for your word is my hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:81-19:119:81" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 119:81</a>) Through the pages of the Bible, Jehovah has kindly given us “a future and a hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jer. 29:11</a>) Our hope for the future depends, not on man’s efforts, but on Jehovah’s promises. May we continue to build our trust in God’s Word by being keen students of Bible prophecy.</p>

But then Jack sat in on a Bible study. The kindness displayed by the brothers conducting the study deeply touched him, and he too started to study. As he applied Bible truth in his life, his conduct and even his personality began to change for the better. In time, Jack qualified to be an unbaptized publisher and got baptized. He zealously preached to other inmates about God’s Kingdom and helped at least four of them to learn the truth. When the day of his execution arrived, Jack was a changed man. One of his attorneys said: “Jack is not the same person I knew 20 years ago. The teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses have changed his life.” Although Jack’s death sentence was carried out, his example certainly highlights that we can trust God’s Word and that it has the power to transform people for the better.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 11:6-9</a>.</p>

Seeing the unity among Jehovah’s people profoundly affected a young man named Jean. He grew up in an African country. When civil war broke out, he joined the army but later fled to a neighboring country. There he came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses. Jean says: “I learned that followers of the true religion do not get involved in politics and are not divided. Rather, they love one another.” He continues: “I had dedicated my life to defending a country. But when I learned <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>Bible truth, I was moved to dedicate my life to Jehovah.” Jean changed completely. Instead of fighting against people of a background different from his, he now shares unifying Bible truth with everyone he meets.

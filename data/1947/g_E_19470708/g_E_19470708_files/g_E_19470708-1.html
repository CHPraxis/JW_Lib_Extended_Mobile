<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Can American Fascism Be Stopped?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font29">C</span><span class="font13">LERICAL fascism in America is more virulent today than at any time in the past. Like an open sore of gangrene it is spreading up the limhs of American democracy, sluffing off the flesh and weakening the health and strength of its victim. Few there be that have done anything to stop this putrefaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An organization called the Committee for the Defense of Civil and Religions Liberty in the Americas, with headquarters at Washington, D.C., describes itself as ^nun-sectarian, non-partisan<sup>11</sup> and ‘'dedicated to the preservation of human rights and the progress of the human race”. Whereas the American Civil Liberties Union deals specifically with violations of civil rights, and the International Religious Liberty Association opposes legislation and overt acts that are against religious freedom, this more recently formed committee describes its purpose in a circular as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Tbe Committee intends to sponsor an educational program which strikes'at the roots of political tyranny and religious persecution. Clerical fascism, both Catholic and Protestant brands, is the great, immediate threat to civil and religious liberty in the Americas. Clerical fascism is the ever-spreading, enveloping fog which is stifling'freedom of thought and expression from Canada to Argentina. From Montreal, Quebec, from Detroit, Boston, Washington, D.C., etc., clerical fascists are pouring forth their sinister propaganda through every available channel of communication. Falangism in South America, Sinareh-ism in Mexico, the Christian Front, the America First party, and others in the Unified States, are on the march to destroy democratic republics, and to crush out the inalienable rights of man. Clerical fascism is the enemy of civil and religious liberty, the enemy yet uneonquered. This enemy we must fight with every ounce of energy we can muster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To realize how alarming the situation is one only has to call to mind how suc-cessfully the Dies Committee, the Rankin Committee and now the Committee on Un-American Activities, have avoided any investigation of the clerical fascists in this country which are fast undermining the life and strength of democracy in America. Instead, such pseudo-protectors of American democracy busy themselves running to and fro witch-hunting for victims they can smear with the red-paint brush which they wield with as much finesse as did a certain late European “paper-hanger”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It seems impossible that a few well-intentioned, high-spirited Americans who have organized themselves for the purpose of defending civil and religious liberty will be able to check the disease at this late stage. Years ago, when this infection was small, a warning was sounded that the sinister power of the Vatican's clergy was taking over the country, but few were awakened by the warning. Now it seems too late to kill uut the disease of American fascism short of amputation. Tn cither event Uncle Sam will be crippled for the rest of his life,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Arctic Icecap Disappearing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font29">B</span><span class="font13">EFORE the Geophysical Institute at the University of California, on May 29- of this year, the noted Swedish scientist, Dr. Hans Ahlmann, declared that the Arctic is slowly warming up. Records show that since 1900 there has been a rise in air temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and in the area around Spitsbergen, that much-discussed island off Norway’s northern tip, the temperature of the ocean water has increased 3 to 5 degrees. Accelerated melting of the Arctic icecap has caused the level of the ocean to rise at the rate of one to one and a half millimeters per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The scientist also pointed out that in 1910 the Arctic ocean along Europe’s northern rim was navigable only three months out of the year, but now it is open eight months. To the nations that are thinking and planning in terms of World War III this is a very significant fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This change in the. Arctic, the Swedish geophysicist thinks, is related in some way to the general climatic changes that are taking place throughout the earth. He mentioned specifically the fact that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">in tropical Africa during the past fifteen </span><span class="font13">or twenty years many small lakes have disappeared and even mammoth Lake Victoria has'dropped seven inches in the past decade. These radical changes, asserted Dr. Ahlmann, are “so serious that I hope an international agency can be formed to study conditions on a global basis. That is most urgent” As to the cause, he said, &quot;We do not even know the reason behind this climatic change in recent years.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Hungary Coup</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hungarian Communists, In the November, 1045, elections, got only 17 percent of the. votes, the Small I.nndhohlrrM party 57 percent. But, encouraged by the Soviet occupation force, the ConuaunUts grew In power, gaining key posts In the government. Finally the premier, Ecrenc Nagy, wnu ne CtiBed of conspiracy against the Republic. The accusation came while he </span><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">was</span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Switzerland, so he chose to remain there, resigning as premier. He was replaced by Lajor Dlpnyes, As a result of this coup early June witnessed much consternation abroad, particularly In the United States and Great Britain. The U. S. blocked the unpaid half of </span><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">$30,000,000 loan to Hungary, and on June 4 forbade Hungarian planes to fly over the American zones In Austria and Germany. Senator Vandenberg denounced Russia's ‘'apparent treacherous conquest” of Hungary, and said It might call for a trial In the forum of the United Nations. President Truiumi Haiti the coup </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">an outrage. </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Hungary Communist and Socialist speakers at hundreds of mootings agitated. against the Western nations, especially the U. 8. A purge of voters </span><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">was</span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"> pushed, disfranchising some 500.000, and a purge of the army was scheduled to follow. Arpad Szakasilz, Socialist deputy premier, said, ‘‘We warn the clergy, especially the</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">higher clergy, that our patience la very nearly exhausted. The clergy should fulfill their evangelical mission, but they have no place in politics.” A priest who had been secretary of state In the premier'* office resigned. Another priest, the No. 2 man In the ousted government, fled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Division of India</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; On June 3, proposals were Aiinonnred for the dividing of India with an offer of Dominion status and the early transfer of power to the Indian governments- Under the plan there will be two main sections, Hindustan and Pakistan, with their respective populations of Approximately 230,000,000 and 70,000,000. There are. besides, 563 princely statets which are scattered through India from north to south, which may constitute another division, Raji-Stan. However, of these some may join Hindustan, others Pakistan, while others may choose to remain independent kingdoms. Jawaharlal Nehru, of the Hindu</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Congress party, and All Jinnah, of the Moslem League, announced acceptance of the plan immediately after It was announced by Viscount Mountbat</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp; President Truman on June 2 made public a report by an Advisory Commission an Universal Military Training. The commission, after six months of study, declared that “unlversAl training Is an essential element in an integrated program of national security”. The report was signed by a leading industrialist, Chas, E. Wilson, as well <sub>v</sub>as by two leading churchmen, Edmund A. Walsh, Catholic (Jesuit), and Dr r&gt;Htdel A. Poling, Protestant. Comment from those on Capitol hill who had read Lhe rejx»rt varied greatly, some favoring, others completely rejecting It. Senator Chan Gurney (Rep.), chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee,, said, •‘Personally, I am for it—as strong as horse-radish.” It Is expected, however, that long hearings will precede action on the report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp; Hinting at &quot;Indescribable horror” in the event of atomic warfare, the presidential Advisory Commission on Universal Training (June 1) said that in a single day twelve of America’s largest cities could be crippled or destroyed and its utilities, railroads and communications* eliminated. It stated that the &quot;most eufseuLiul production facilities, including Uiose engaged In. the manufacture of atomic explosives’<sup>1</sup>, could be quickly destroyed, while &quot;the chances of interception In a surprise attack are an Alight that a high percentage of the attacking force must be expected tu reach its goal”. The com minion thought, however, that It would not be until 1955 that an atomic attack could be made on the U. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Railway Strike in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By the end of the first week of June practically all of France’s railways wore at a standstill and Stations were deserted. The strike, begun at Paris, had spread rapidly throughout the country, and the only exceptions to the general paralysis of rail way operation were the food tralna The strike was seen to be to reprisal for the premier’s dismissal of CommiiniKtH from the government. Speaking in the Assembly on June 3, Premier Ra-madier accused the Communists of responsibility for the strike, which, he said, threatened the authority of the Republic. French labor leaders denied that the strike </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">w:ls</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> ugaiu^t the government, asserting that workers had walked mu on uccoimi of the “misery in their homes”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; Early in June President Truman, evideotly referring to certain iiewgpuj&lt;i' advertisements, asked U.

In England leading government officials, Including Revin and Eden, received explosive letters, which the Stern gang of Paleslhie iiuiiifnl lately claimed to have sent Meanwhile Zionists continued to agitate for Jewish rule of Pnlcetine, Lieut. General Sir Alan Cunningham, high commissioner of Palestine, asserted * “If the Palestine troops were permitted to use the full power of their weapons against the whole Jewish community, terrorists' activities would be brought to an end In n matter □f hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The American Council for Judaism, Inc, on June 8 submitted to the United Nations a memorandum asking that body to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. It asserted that such a slate would be harmful to Jews throughout the world and would endanger peace and security in the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope Warns World</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On June 2 the pope celebrated his “name day”, the one devoted to “Saint Eugene<sup>1</sup>', Eugene being the pope’s real name. The pope’s speech ranged over the sorry world situation, and was couched in general terms, The general trend of the speech was to emphasize and deepen the dividing line between East and Wear, which the speech sought to align with Communist and <sup>,4</sup>ChrIstiAn” principles. The implication was that the Western powers are Christian, a term which the pope seemed to be inclined to limit to Roman Catholics, but not too definitely. He warned the world that It might be plunged again into thft. &quot;poisonous and deleterious miasma of new and lucalcAlablo calamities&quot;. He laid the responsibility for delays in peace negotiations upon Moscow. He mentioned incidentally how wonderful is the Boman Catholic church, depending upon man’s .forgetfulness or Indifference to overlook die miseries of the poor in Roman Catholic lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">floods In the IL 8</span></p>

Bridges were washed out The Dea Moines river (Iowa) overflowed Its bonks, and drove thousands from homes which were soon submerged to the eaves or completely covered by the rising </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">waters. Levees </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">along tbe Mississippi broke in msfiy places, swamping thousands of acres of farmlands. In Oregon u &quot;flash flood” resulted from hall and rain, and swept away four tourist camps. Tbe Missouri, roaring down to join the Mississippi, flooded a million acres of land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">1947 YEARBOOK </span><span class="font6">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is the Peacemaker. If it were not for Jehovah’s seeing to it that his purposes are carried out, peace would never come to this earth. Satan the Devil, a rebel against God’s organization, brought violence and death to mankind. Since the desire entered into Lucifer’s heart to become like the Most High God and to usurp the power of Jehovah, he as Satan the Devil has taken peace from the earth. The only way that world peace can be restored is by Jehovah God’s showing his supreme power, proving his universal domination by destroying the Devil, thus vindicating his name and Word. All of Satan’s wicked heavenly hosts and his earthly organization must be cleaned out with him forever. The Scriptures say that Satan is “the god of this world”, the god of “this present evil world” that is given over to everything selfish. Peace cannot reign among selfish men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one scans the history of this world, Biblical history or secular history, one may clearly see the rise and fall of world powers due to carnal wars, not peace. War is strife, not tranquillity. Behind all such strife is the instigator, Satan the Devil, who for centuries has tried to turn the minds of all men away from the God of peace and lead them into complete destruction through a turbulent life. The Creator of the universe and of man has ordained otherwise; for He has made provision whereby men can gain life in a peaceful world upon this earth. God’s original purpose to establish upon earth a righteous world, graced with peace and prosperity, with man enjoying all its blessings, will yet come true. “For God so loved the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth [a new world], wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one will enjoy living eternally unless he lives in peace, peace with God and peace with his fellow man. The great doctrine taught by the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who makes this eternal life possible, is: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.” (Luke 10:27) Here, then, is the secret for peace. “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”—Ps. 119:165.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>“THE PRINCE OF PEACE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus Christ, recognized the Messiah as a Teacher and Lawgiver from God, and he pointed to him as the One who came from heaven and who was above all others. He said: “It is to what he has seen and heard that he gives testimony, and yet no one accepts his testimony. Whoever does accept it has thereby acknowledged that God is true. For he whom God has sent speaks God’s words, for God gives him his spirit without measure.” (John 3: 32-34, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> God’s word is true, and it will never return to him void. According to his Word Jehovah’s Son Jesus Christ is the appointed ruler of the new world; and the law of that righteous new world will be based upon the simple principle of love for God and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Centuries before “The Prince of Peace” arrived the prophet Isaiah announced his coming in these words: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isa. 9:6) Here “The Prince of Peace” is identified as the ruler of the New Government. Speaking of the great change that would take place in the ruling of this earth and of the rule that would exist among his own people Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah says: “And peace will I make your government.” (Isa. 60:17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span><span class="font5">) And furthermore he said: “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”—Isa. 9: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mankind today is fearful of human governments’ destroying one another and annihilating themselves. As long as selfishness reigns among the nations there can be no peace on this earth. Jehovah God is the only One that can bring about peace, for he is the Peacemaker. It is he who will destroy the Devil and all his organization by placing “The Prince of Peace” in his rightful place of rulership. Nineteen hundred years ago men who were dissatisfied with world conditions and with the rulers of this world turned at once to the Messiah, “The Prince of Peace,” when he made his appearance. They followed him and took up his teaching of peace. It is a doctrine whereby men love one another in true unselfishness, a doctrine whereby all men love the only true God Jehovah as supreme and above all. Among themselves there was no reason for quarreling. There was no need for war, so that one group could dominate the other. The true church of God recognized “The Higher Powers” as being Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ. There was no occasion for one’s trying to seize power over another individual, for that which they learned from the Son of God proved beyond question that life is gained by serving one another and serving the true God, “the God of peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, with the Son of God among them, here was something new in the way of Theocratic arrangement of government. Christ Jesus recognized his Father as over all; and the disciples recognized Jesus as receiving authority from his Father to direct the activity of his disciples. With such an organization having Higher Powers directing from heaven in righteousness, and, in addition, with a guidebook, the Bible, those who came under the rule of this righteous organization could live in peace among themselves, even in a wicked world tom by strife and turmoil. This has been true of genuine Christians down through the centuries of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet says: “Disappointment comes to those w'ho plot evil; but happiness to those who plan good.” (Prov. 12:20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> The wicked have gone their way for almost six thousand years, and during that time there have been no peace and harmony among the wicked. They have always plotted evil, because of selfishness. God through his prophet Isaiah states: “ ‘There is no peace,’ says the Lord, ‘for the wicked.’ ” (Isa. 48 : 22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> On the other hand, we have the good Teacher, Jesus Christ, preaching a good message, namely, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” His followers taking up this good message have gained happiness and peace, even though living in troublesome times and under great stress and persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious clergy of Jesus’ day, and the political rulers, all under the god of this world, tried Jesus to the limit and even killed him. All kinds of injustices were heaped upon the Savior, but at no time did he compromise with this world and support the wicked regime. He did not engage in the controversies between nations and religions. He exposed them because of their wickedness. He was not interested in their polities or their finance, but he showed whither their evil practices were leading. He had been sent into the world for a very definite purpose, to speak the truth. He spoke it plainly at all times, on behalf of those who loved peace. He brought liberty to the captives of Satan’s world who wanted to be freed from those who plotted evil. He did not try to tear down with violence the existing arrangement of things. It was not then time for him to do so as God’s Executive Officer. That time will come in the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead, it was then the will of God that Jesus should preach a message of comfort, present good tidings to the meek, bind up the brokenhearted, and open the prison to those that were bound in Satan’s organization.—Isa. 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Son of God was at peace with his Father in heaven, and he could remain at peace with his Father as long as he kept unspotted from the world and did not become entangled in world affairs. He stayed at peace with his disciples, because he applied the Theocratic rule to them and they recognized the Theocratic order that had been established. He went peacefully from house to house, from city to city, performing miracles and doing good to those whom he met. His associates lived at peace with him. He taught his followers not to be part of this world, despite their being in it. His work was a simple work, preaching the good news of the Kingdom to those who had an ear to hear. There was so much sorrow, turmoil and distress in the world; and it was not his purpose to add to that sorrow and mourning, but to relieve the people of their pain and suffering by bringing to them a message of peace. He said to the thousands of listeners who were assembled before him on the mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” (Matt. 5:9) Everywhere he went he heralded forth the message of the Kingdom and invited his hearers to be messengers of peace and salvation, and to carry to the ends of the earth the good news of the coming righteous new world. While he preached peace, he maintained peace among his organization, his disciples and faithful followers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>PEACEFUL MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Centuries of time have passed since the Messiah walked upon the earth and preached his message of peace. Religious organizations have arisen meantime that claim to be following Christ Jesus, and all these have come out for the support of worldly governments. No clear vision do they have of Christ’s teaching to be separate from the world, but, rather, on every hand the religious organizations are found supporting carnal war, their parishioners in one nation fighting against their so-called “brethren” of another nation. The doctrine of peace that Jesus taught has faded into insignificance before their eyes. Yes, “Blessed are the peacemakers”; but where are they in Christendom ? When a war ends, the religious leaders gather together and cry, “Peace, peace!” and associate themselves with tbe politicians in a united world conspiracy ostensibly for peace but in reality against God’s kingdom. They have sold themselves to the god of this world, Satan the Devil. They are supporting and trying to revive that dying old worldly organization. Are there no real followers of Jesus Christ living upon the earth today? Are there none that take up his simple teachings of separateness from this world? Are there no persons going about upon the earth and living up to the beatitude, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God” ? Granting that there are some few, is it possible for such individuals to enjoy peace in a world filled with war, turmoil and strife, with famine and pestilence on every hand? Is it possible for a man to love his neighbor, especially now when he sees his neighbor trying to grab all that he can get selfishly? Let us look and see if there are any such real peacemakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many years before the first world war broke out in 1914, there was a small group of Christian people announcing the approach of the end of Satan’s world. They told the nations that the time for the Devil’s uninterrupted rule to end was 1914, at the end of the Gentile times that year. Basing their hope and teaching on God’s Word, the Bible, they made announcement in advance of great world trouble then. It came as foretold in Matthew, chapter 24, and Revelation 11:15-18, beginning with world war. During that war, because of the faithful stand that Jehovah’s witnesses took they were nearly crushed out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A faithful remnant remained. The Most High God in heaven preserved them, for here were peacemakers preaching the only hope of the world. At the close of the war many of these were brought out of prison and places of seclusion, and the small Christian groups were reorganized. They went forward in an expanding preaching-campaign that has never been paralleled in the history of the world, a campaign announcing the King and his kingdom, a kingdom of peace ruled by “The Prince of Peace”. For twenty years, from 1919 to 1939, Jehovah’s witnesses pushed their message to the ends of the earth, making ‘glad the nations with his people’.—Rom. 15:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>VIOLENCE DOES NOT DESTROY PEACEMAKERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Then came 1939, with the start of the second world war, that engulfed many and mighty nations of the earth. Would Jehovah’s witnesses be made desolate a second time as they were during the first world war? Would they be scattered into disorganization? Would their comforting message of peace be taken from the earth while men fought for world domination and for a “new world order fashioned by man’s hands” ? The god of this world, Satan the Devil, anciently tried to destroy Jesus Christ and his apostles and the early church. Ever since that time he has tried to destroy men of Christian integrity. During the World War from 1914 to 1918 he put forth every effort to crush Jehovah’s witnesses out of existence. By 1918 Satan’s earthly representatives thought they had accomplished it, but Jehovah’s witnesses came back revived and guided by God’s spirit. During the second world war, beginning in 1939, every effort was renewed by the rulers of this world to destroy these peaceful Christians and their organization. The year’s report of the evangelism done by Jehovah’s witnesses in 1939 showed that there were 71,509 ministers of the gospel in their ranks devoting their time, energy and finances to spreading the good news of God’s kingdom, making glad the nations with His people. Would they hold out through the years of war that followed? or would they be scattered and crushed? Time was certain to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The German government under the rule of Hitler seized their property, their publications, and their machinery, and disbanded the organization, took its members and put them in prisons and concentration camps, and killed many of them. In the ruthless war that he began he overran Poland and there broke up the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. He moved into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Rumania, Hungary and most parts of Europe. Everywhere he went with his hordes of destruction he had his Gestapo ferret out Jehovah’s witnesses and tried to wipe them out. These Christian men and women who loved peace and who would not support Hitler’s war were beaten, herded into camps and starved and ill-clothed; but with all of this punishment upon them he was unable to break them down and turn them against their God and cause them to forsake the preaching of their message of peace announcing God’s kingdom. Verily while they lived under these horrible conditions in the various countries of Europe, the good news of God’s eternal government of freedom and peace was continually preached!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses were, whether like involuntary slaves in mines and quarries or prisoners in torture camps and filthy prisons, they held to the teaching of Jesus Christ; and they appreciated to the full his command: “Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations,” preaching this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. Their consecration to serve God was real. For such reason they had to serve the interests of the Kingdom and the interests of its peace, namely, the peace-bringing Government that God established in the hands of his “Prince of Peace”. For six wartime years Jehovah’s witnesses in these lands, living under most trying conditions as they did, continued to love their Father in heaven and his King and their neighbor, and no matter where they were, underground or precariously free or in custody of ruthless Nazis and Fascists, they preached the message of peace and the kingdom of God. Would their efforts bear fruit ? Yes; for their message was not forgotten by those who were sighing and crying for all the abominations that were being done in the land. There were so many persons that needed comfort; there were so many that wanted to be free from captivity, that is, the captivity of this old world under enslavement by Satan. These were due to respond to the message proclaimed; and they did.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>NO GOVERNMENT FAVORS PEACEMAKERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">We might think that likely the belligerent Allied nations would be kinder to Jehovah’s witnesses and would allow them greater freedom in the territory which they dominated. But no, not much better! The democratic lands and nations threw bands around Jehovah’s witnesses with a view to stopping their work. In many countries these ministers of the gospel were seized and thrown into prison, or hounded by mobs of religionists, and all kinds of wickedness were performed against them, especially in the United States, in Britain and in Canada. And in other parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth restrictions were put on the distribution of the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses and even upon the Bible in some places. Their stocks of literature in many warehouses were seized. The ports were closed to the importation of books, booklets and magazines printed by the Watchtower Society. In some countries their property was taken over by the governments and given to the military, religious or commercial organizations of the land. Every interference was put in the way of the progressive work of preaching the message of peace to the people of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But did this destroy the tranquillity and unity of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses? Not at all! They were at peace with God and with their brethren in all nations. They loved their neighbor, and no matter in what land they lived and under what conditions, they went forward as Christ Jesus had taught them to do, preaching from house to house, from village to village, in the byways and the highways, in concentration camps and prisons. No; they did not stop preaching the kingdom of heaven as being at hand; for they knew that this message was more vital to the people who loved righteousness than any other thing in the world. The Devil and his entire organization, invisible and visible, were unable to break up their forward movement and their unity and peace within God’s organization. Wherever Jehovah’s witnesses were, either congregated or isolated, they carried on in a peaceful manner their proclamation of the good news. The governmental reaction to their preaching was not peaceable, however, and it took really courageous men and women to withstand the assaults of worldly officials. They did not out of fear change their mind or attitude toward the preaching of the message of “The Prince of Peace”. They had full confidence that Jehovah God would bring them through to do even greater work. And this He did, for his servants are fighters for the new world, and it requires real integrity to stand up under the grueling through which the world puts a steadfast Christian. They believed, as Jesus declared, namely: “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight.” (John 18:36) Since his kingdom is of the new world, they fight for such righteous new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah said concerning His servants amid a world in turmoil: “And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the product of justice quietness and confidence forever. My people will dwell in peaceful homes, in secure abodes, and in quiet resting-places.” (Isa. 32:17-20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses throughout all the earth went through some crushing experiences amid this turbulent world. Physically it was a great trial; but they kept in mind the apostle’s words as recorded at 1 Peter 2:21: “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” Therefore when trials and persecutions befell them, they did not turn out of his steps, for they knew that “God is with us!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>PUBLISHERS OF PEACE INCREASE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Centuries ago it was recorded, and later repeated by the apostle Paul, concerning the faithful servants of God: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reign-eth!” (Isa. 52:7) The heralds of Christ Jesus did not fail with respect to the fulfillment of this prophecy. They did not hesitate or compromise in announcing the kingdom of God during all the bitter years of war and persecution; and their faithfulness to Jehovah God bore marvelous results. Behold! In those few years’ time, from 1939 to 1946, Jehovah’s witnesses in the role of ministers of the gospel increased from 71,509 to 169,326. Though subject to all the persecution, reproach, trial, suffering and distress, many hearers that believed the Kingdom gospel took up this good message of peace, until today there are approximately 100,000 more blessed peacemakers, preaching the gospel, than before the second world war began. Truly, it is impossible for the nations of earth to halt the onward march of the Government of peace, the Government that will have no end but that shall consume all the nations against Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the apostle Paul’s day many nations were given the opportunity to hear the glad news of the Kingdom; but the scripture proof that he wrote in his letter to the Romans is having a greater application today and a much larger fulfillment than in Paul’s day. Then he wrote: “Be glad, ye nations, with his people; and again, Be giving praise, all ye nations, unto the Lord, and let all the peoples repeat his praise; and again Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule nations, upon him shall nations hope.” Then Paul added: “Now the God of the hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye may surpass in the hope, in the power of holy spirit.” (Rom. 15:10-13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> The hope that wells up in one’s heart because of hearing the good news of God’s kingdom of peace and prosperity will so overflow that this hope and good news of Jehovah’s righteous Government will stream forth from the individual having knowledge thereof. By such hope those of Jehovah’s witnesses who have been in concentration camps in Germany, Japan, Siam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other parts of the world, were sustained, and they radiated it out by preaching the gospel while in those camps. They have not refrained, and will not refrain, from shouting the inviting call: “Be glad, ye nations, with his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the UN is put forward as the instrument for world peace and security. But true lovers of peace will not be enticed by the world conspiracy in the form of that United Nations organization, for it will never bring enduring peace. Jehovah’s witnesses have found peace, for they know God and his Son. They have come under his peaceful reign. They heed the admonition of Paul, as he set it forth in Hebrews 12:14-17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(An Amer. Trans.):</span><span class="font5"> “Try to be at peace with everyone, and strive for that [holiness] without which no one can see the Lord. Be careful that no one fails to gain God’s favor, or some poisonous root may come up to trouble and contaminate you all—some immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his very birthright for one single meal. For you know how, when he afterward wished to claim the blessing, he was refused it, although he begged for it with tears, for he had no opportunity to repent of what he had done.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>UNITY AND PEACE PREVAIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are Jehovah’s witnesses cannot afford not to be at peace and unity with everyone within the Lord’s organization. They strive to maintain their holiness before God by non-conformity to this world. They cannot look to the United Nations organization and be entangled with this world and think that peace among all the nations will come through it. “The Prince of Peace” has arisen to rule the nations, and “upon him shall the nations hope”. This is the only hope that will bring joy, gladness and peace to man. One that has a knowledge of the Kingdom truth must not be as Esau, who sold his birthright for one single meal. The apostle admonished us that we should not make the mistake of compromising with this world and selling ourselves out to the world in time of stress and pressure or with desire for the things of this world. We must strive to keep our integrity by carrying out our consecration vow and help our brethren to do that, assisting them in being wholly devoted to the interests of God’s kingdom of peace. He has given us peace in these “the last days” of Satan’s organization, and we will remain under the direction of “The Prince of Peace”. Jehovah’s witnesses will therefore stand as ‘signs and wonders’ in the world because of the peaceful position they have taken in contrast with this world at war with Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. The reason they can courageously take this position is that “God is with us!”—Isa. 8:10,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So, Jehovah’s witnesses are fearless against the world conspiracy and speak plainly the truth to all the nations and welcome them to praise Jehovah. They invite all lovers of righteousness, saying: “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” (Ps. 117:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font5">The great Peacemaker, Jehovah, will bless and keep his people for the vindication of his name and word and universal sovereignty. And this report for the past service year (1945-1946) of Jehovah’s witnesses is proof of the faithfulness of his chosen people and of their peace-loving conduct toward Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus and their fellow man.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>SOCIETIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In order to carry on the good work of making glad the nations with his people, it has been necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to organize legal bodies in different parts of the earth which are used to direct the work, and which corporations are recognized by the governments of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses of modem times formed their first corporation in the state of Pennsylvania. It is known as the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and was incorporated in 1884. It is a charitable and benevolent organization, and its charter makes provision for the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of publication of tracts, pamphlets, magazines, books and Bibles. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a small group of men and women, wholly devoted to Jehovah God, believed it advisable to form a corporation so that there would be a directive body for all those persons seeking to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in the world for a witness. This Bible Society grew under the Lord’s guidance and direction until now its branches reach out into all parts of the earth. Most of the branch addresses are listed on the last page of this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As thousands of people of good-will saw their responsibility of teaching God’s Word in the various nations, it became necessary to establish other corporations in some of these countries so that this peaceful work might go on with as little interference as possible. Regardless of the name of the corporation or its location, the individuals associated with these corporations are Jehovah’s witnesses and look to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its principal publication, namely, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, for their spiritual food; and they follow the Society’s lead in spreading the good message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this society of ministers grew larger and expanded in the United States, it became necessary to establish a corporation in the state of New York. This organization is known by the name Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated. Its principal charge is to look after the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York state and throughout the United States. It owns and operates the Bethel home, the printing plant in Brooklyn, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, a radio station, and several farms in the state of New York. This New York corporation also does all the printing for the Pennsylvania corporation, which directs the world-wide activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1914 it was found necessary to create an association in the United Kingdom of Great Britain for the benefit of Jehovah’s witnesses in that territory. This organization is known as the International Bible Students Association of the United Kingdom. Its principal office is located in London, England. It owns certain properties and does the necessary printing of books and booklets whenever such things cannot be supplied by the Pennsylvania corporation as was especially true during the war years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are other societies in different parts of the world, all nonprofit and devoted wholly to the preaching of the gospel, that co-operate and work with the Pennsylvania corporation in carrying forward its world-wide commission. Some of these have been established in Continental Europe, South America, and other places. All of these co-operating societies use the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine as their principal study publication. Therefore all see eye to eye as to the work that must be done in behalf of the people of good-will throughout the world. In many instances these different corporations have the same officers directing their societies’ activities.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>THE BETHEL HOME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, is situated a building which houses the principal offices of the Society. It is from this place that the world-wide work of Jehovah’s witnesses is directed. A large family works together daily in performing the many tasks that are necessary to get the work accomplished. In this home are housed the studios of radio station WBBR, which serves Greater New York with excellent programs. What it broadcasts is worth listening to, with no commercial advertising. WBBR is not burdened down with silly ditties and chitter-chatter. It has nothing to sell; the truth is free. Its transmitter is located on Staten Island, where many brethren work earnestly raising good food for the Bethel family and spending as much time as possible in missionary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not far from the Bethel home is located the large printing plant of Jehovah’s witnesses where Bibles, books, booklets and magazines are produced by the millions. The individuals working in this printing plant, those serving in the Bethel home—in fact, those in all society-operated institutions—are volunteer workers, wholly consecrated to do Jehovah’s will and anxious to serve in behalf of their brethren worldwide. All receive the same allowance as the president of the Society does, namely, $10 per month. In addition to this, each one has comfortable living quarters and receives three fine meals each day. The farms which the Society owns and operates in the above manner provide food for the Bethel home and the Gilead School. Thus the cost of operating the home and school is brought down to a minimum of expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each member of the family has his assigned duty and does his work gladly, for each one knows that his work is necessary in the organization. What each one does has a direct bearing on the production of books or Bibles which contain God’s word of truth, and which are put into the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide for the preaching of the gospel. Not only do they have the privilege of working in the factory, home, office or radio station, but each one has time to get into the field service himself so as to make some people glad with this good news which we have. The Brooklyn family has grown considerably in the last year. On August 31, 1946, there were 274 men and women serving in the Brooklyn Bethel home, to compare with last year’s number of 232. This is an increase of 42 over a year ago. Twenty-one of these members of the family had received special training at the Bible School of Gilead and were being given further instruction on organizational work and office routine before going to their missionary assignments. The Bethel home has for the past two years been much too small to accommodate all of the Bethel family. Two other homes not too far distant from the Bethel home have been purchased by the Society to house the overflow of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the month of May, 1946, the New York corporation received notice from the City of New York that the city plans to build a superhighway whose proposed route is along the rear of the Bethel home, and that it is necessary for the city to take 50 feet of the New York society’s property in order to construct this highway according to the proposed plans. The part of the building the city is taking houses our furnace room, laundry, pressing shop, radio studios, kitchen, diningroom, machine shop, large storage rooms, many bedrooms, and other vital parts of the institution. It means that now the Bethel family will have to move out of that portion of the building and accustom itself to living in the remaining part and at other locations in the city until new quarters can be built. The city recently notified the Society that demolition of this part of the nine-story building which they take begins December 1, 1946. This will inconvenience the family and affect the general routine considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing that as soon as the war was over it would be necessary to expand the living quarters of the Bethel home, radio station and factory, the necessary steps were taken to buy property for expansion. Such a program was begun more than two years ago. The property having been purchased, the New York corporation was about ready to go ahead with its plans. Now with the city coming through and taking part of the Bethel home, it is more essential than ever for us to get our new additions constructed. There are many obstacles in the way, such as the procuring of Government permits, scarcity of materials, and numerous regulations with which we must comply; but, by the Lord’s grace, we will begin construction just as quickly as we can on the addition to the present Bethel home, so that all the family can be housed under one roof again. However, the family has expressed itself as being determined not to let these inconveniences interfere with production of publications for the preaching of the gospel. While many members of the family will be scattered in different parts of the city, all of them will continue to come together to perform their daily duties at the factory, home and radio studios. They will be living with the brethren in Greater New York, which is a convenience greatly appreciated by the Society. There is a work to be done. The Bethel family will, by the Lord’s grace, do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following quotation from the Bethel servant’s report shows the true spirit of the Bethel family and their love for their brethren. He says: “When we review the goodness of Jehovah to us here at Bethel during the past year, we have every reason to rejoice in his loving-kindness and provision to be glad with his people. The year was filled throughout with many good things, and crowned with the blessing of the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland, Ohio. The Bethel family, almost without exception, had the privilege of attending this glad feast. One of the things that enriched it for us was the close association we here at Bethel had with those of our faithful brethren from foreign fields for some weeks prior to the assembly in Cleveland. Their association with us brought us closer together in the common bond of love for Jehovah and love for his Kingdom. Another thing that made us rejoice: Early in the year there was an appeal for clothing for our needy brethren in Europe. The Bethel family responded well by donating 1,287 articles of clothing. The family was glad that they could give from the things they had for the comfort of their brethren in need.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are a peaceful, happy family, ready for any work and appreciating the glorious treasure of service here at Bethel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ counsel to his disciples was, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:19, A.S.V.) They were charged with ministerial activity; they went forth and preached the good news. They were ordained by the holy spirit of God to preach. (Isa. 61:1-3; Matt. 24:14) From that time onward lovers of righteousness have consecrated themselves to do Jehovah’s will, and Jehovah God has anointed them to preach. The only persons brought into the Bethel family are those who have already consecrated their lives to serve Jehovah God and who have been ministers of the gospel for some time, preaching from house to house and publicly. Therefore when they come into the Bethel home they are already qualified ministers. In addition to taking care of their regular duties in the office, factory, radio studios, or home, special courses of Bible study are followed out by each member. Regular study classes are conducted each week, and the Bible is always the principal textbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The list of ordained ministers in the 1947 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> by no means includes all of those recognized by the Society as qualified to teach and preach. This list of ordained ministers is comprised of those who are associated with the Society in its Branch offices and institutions as well as in the Bethel home at Brooklyn, all of whom receive special assignments to serve various congregations throughout the territory in which they are located. There are thousands of others who are ordained to carry on ministerial work, such as the missionaries who have been sent out into many parts of the earth, those who are in the full-time pioneer service (mentioned later on in this publication), as well as those associated with the company organizations. Space would not allow for the publication of the entire list of ordained ministers recognized by the Society. However, all ordained of God are qualified to preach, and they give evidence of their ordination by their daily activity and course of life.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Since the dedication of Gilead in February, 1943, a total of 702 ordained ministers, men and women, have entered its portals. There they have been given a very thorough training in the Bible, which has strengthened their faith and prepared them to go on in missionary work. Of the total number that started the course, 659 completed their studies and have graduated from the School. Up to the present time upward of 350 have gone into foreign missionary fields and have done excellent work in making glad the nations with his people. The Society is well pleased with the School and its accomplishments, because Jehovah’s rich blessing has been upon this institution. It is a school dedicated to the ministry of righteousness. A “heap of witness” to the honor and glory of Jehovah's name has been piled up throughout the world due to the good works of the graduates of Gilead. The registrar of the School reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gilead during the past service year has continued to train its quota of men and women for the foreign missionary fields. The 194 graduates for the year 1946 joined the ranks of hundreds of earlier graduates prepared for their Bible educational career abroad in making glad the nations with his people. These like the others attest to the truthfulness of Solomon’s words: “Jehovah glveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: he layeth up sound wisdom for the upright.” (Prov. 2:6,7, A.S.V.) It has been their experience that sound wisdom from above is easily entreated (Jas. 3:17), yielding peaceable fruits of righteousness. In centuries past Jehovah, in his loving mercy, has laid up abundant wisdom in his storehouse, the Bible, making It possible for diligent seekers today to find hid treasures therein. Completing a term of five months wholly set aside to Intensive Bible study, Gilead graduates become the richer as to these heavenly treasures. Gilead counts its mission fulfilled if it has enriched its students to some degree as to these lasting riches of Bible knowledge; for It is known that Bible knowledge protects a Theocratic minister from evil, while on the other hand it thoroughly equips him for good works of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sixth and seventh school terms were conducted during the past service year. The sixth class began school August 27, 1945, with an enrollment of 98 students. Most of the registrants were ordained ministers called from different parts of the United States and Canada, although two were from Argentina and one from Brazil. Another was from Jamaica. Ninety-one of those starting the term completed the course, of whom 86 were awarded diplomas of merit. A midwinter graduation was held for this class on Monday, January 21, 1946. This first postwar graduation was attended by 544 persons assembled in the main auditorium.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">On February 21, 1946, the seventh term began with 105 Theocratic ministers enrolled, the largest class till then, made up of Americans, Canadians, and some from Austria and Brazil. The group was comprised of 58 male ministers and 47 female missionaries. A revised schedule of classes, with some new courses, was introduced in this term, proving to be a definite advancement in methods of Bible education. The twenty-three weeks of instruction covering the revised curriculum were completed late in July by 103 of the original 105 registrants. The student body made excellent progress in the ministerial studies. Finally, on Sunday July 28, a very delightful graduation was held out of doors for the 103 students. More than 1,000 guests and relatives of the students, some of whom came from England, attended these exercises, at which time 93 of the students were awarded diplomas of merit</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Gilead will always have a warm spot in the heart of each of the graduates from that school. First of all, each student has had the blessed opportunity of spending twenty-three weeks of study of the most important book of all time, the Bible. This has made them rich. Additionally, they have learned to live peacefully with other people of like precious faith, and have studied much about organization. They have been taught to use Bible helps more efficiently than before they came to school. They feel more keenly than ever before their responsibilities before God, and with real zeal they go forward as missionaries to preach the gospel in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to the present time graduates of Gilead are carrying on their work in thirty different nations. Many others are being used in the United States as servants to the brethren in the various circuits, and also in the district servant work. Still others have been assigned to the special pioneer work in the United States, because there is as much need for missionary work in America as in any other country. The good work that has been begun at Gilead we hope will extend to the ends of the earth and have its effect upon hundreds of thousands of people, so that they will obey the exhortation: “Praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” The company publishers have supported very well this missionary work through their contributions to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Pennsylvania corporation that directs it. The Society spent $138,689.48 for missionary work during the service year 1946.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>A BLESSED SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To be engaged in work that benefits others is truly a blessed service. Those in Society institutions do just that. The report which follows gives the reader some idea of what has been done to serve the publishers of the Kingdom world-wide with literature, so that the good news of the Kingdom might reach those who want to hear. A part of the Branch servant’s report for the United States reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your announcement to the Brooklyn Bethel family on June 20, 1946, that the Brooklyn factory and office would henceforth operate as the United States Branch brought much joy to all of us. In accordance with this adjustment, the following report is being submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the service year 1946 there was an average of 198 brethren working at the Adams Street factory and office. This was a considerable increase over 1945, at which time we had an average of 182 workers. The increase was due mainly to the fact that many brethren were temporarily engaged in office or factory work while receiving training pending transfer to an assignment in some other country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the lifting of bans against the importation of literature in many countries, we were able to send greater supplies into these fields. This made it necessary to put in many additional hours because of the increase of work that fell on our shoulders. But for this we are glad, for the brethren in the Bethel home treasure dearly the God-given privilege of serving their fellow workers world-wide; and we are grateful to the Lord for the strength and opportunity to serve in this blessed place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the visible and armed struggle between nations had ceased, it did not bring an influx of materials for printing so far as our institution was concerned. Through earnest effort on the part of the purchasing department we have thus far been able to get the required necessities to keep on with our production ; but sometimes the outlook was dark. Prices are higher and quality is poorer, but we were able to obtain sufficient material to turn out 173.450 more bound books this year than during the previous service year. Leading among the books published was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom. Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font4"> of which we completed 1,267,934. Since the release of this excellent publication we have reached an amazing total of copies printed, namely, 3,786,000. Outstanding in this year’s production was the 64-page booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”.</span><span class="font4"> By the end of the service year we had printed 7,224,062 in English, and 249,058 in Spanish. Almost all of these have already been shipped out from the Brooklyn factory. Reaching new peaks in production because the publishers are distributing the good news, gives us great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the work opening up in many lands and missionaries going into new territories, it has been necessary to print in more languages than during the last few years. Publications were produced in twenty different languages this year, while in the former year only fourteen different languages were printed. With the expansion and reconstruction work going on in full swing, undoubtedly 1947 will mean printing more publications in more languages than ever before. By the Lord’s grace we shall be ready to take care of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All members of the Bethel family watched with keen anticipation the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign of 1946. It made glad the heart of everyone to see the new peak reached in printing of magazines, namely, 25,242,350. This is an increase of 5,909,495 over any previous year. In fact, the increase alone is more than the entire year’s production of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation of</span><span class="font4"> eight years ago. At the present time we are mailing out about 625,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> each issue, and about 380,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine. We sincerely believe that both of these mailing lists will be greatly increased during the 1947 service year. Set out below is the comparison of the publications of the Brooklyn factory for the years 1945 and 1946.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">To obtain material for the above publications has been most difficult. However, we did succeed in obtaining the necessary 3,000 tons of paper, which represents an increase of 312 tons over the previous year. Our shipping and mailing departments have been pressed to the limit taking care of the publications delivered to them by the factory. Mail coming Into the office has been the heaviest ever, due mainly to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign of January-May. Orders and subscriptions received required the shipping and mailing departments to send out 42,590,529 pieces of literature, meaning books, booklets, magazines and Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is stated on page 38 of the 1946 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font4"> “Undoubtedly in the next year or two shipping facilities will greatly improve for foreign shipment.” This truly has been the case, for there has been a tremendous increase this past year in the amount of literature shipped to countries other than the United States. In 1945 there were 3,229,309 books and booklets sent to countries other than the United States; but in 1946 this figure leaped up to 6,940,953 copies. Of this number, 2,777,211 were in languages other than English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most blessed services the brethren enjoyed was special work that befell the shipping department. This work came about because of your urgent letter, Brother Knorr, concerning the need of clothing on the part of our brethren in Europe. Acting upon your call for help while touring Europe, the brethren in different sections of the United States were advised of the needs of our European brethren and they generously supplied the same. It was necessary to call in some publishers from New York to assist in the packing of this clothing. We appreciated their services very much, and it made it possible for us to ship out from Brooklyn In a short time a total of 278,070 pounds of clothing. The brethren packed 986 wooden cases with shoes, blankets, and men’s and women’s clothing. It was Indeed a pleasure to help God’s servants in many lands in this manner, in addition to supplying the spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the great increase in tile work, especially in the mailing of magazines, the shipping costs have gone up quite a sum as compared with the previous year. Increases in carrying charges and higher costs for shipping supplies (wrapping paper, cartons, twine, etc.) sent the shipping expenses up to the total of $213,157.29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no question about our being overcrowded in our present factory. As the work grows in all lands, there is an increased demand on the factory for supplies. We are glad of this; but what brought us great gladness of heart and keen anticipation for the future was your announcement at the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland of your plans to build a new factory sufficiently large to take care of all the expansion for some time to come. We know that this expansion will place greater responsibility upon the Bethel family, but, speaking as a member of the family, we look forward to the completion of this new Brooklyn Branch factory and the increase of our facilities to carry on in greater measure, by the Lord’s grace, the expansion and reconstruction work of making glad the nations with his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>“BE GLAD, YE NATIONS, WITH HIS PEOPLE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">—Rom. 15:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This text was the theme of Jehovah’s witnesses for the year 1946. While it has always been their privilege and obligation to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, 1946 was a particular year to them, a year of greater freedom from opposition. Therefore every effort was made to preach the gospel to all nations, as many as they could enter into, there to make the people of many different languages glad with His chosen people. In this effort they were greatly rewarded. The world, as Jesus said, is the field in which Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their work; therefore Jehovah’s witnesses have the responsibility to go unto the ends of the earth in their dis-cipling work. The ministry begun by Christ Jesus was taken up by the apostles and handed on to the early church, and it has continued on till this day. Modernday Jehovah’s witnesses are not slacking their hand in performing Christian duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1947 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> witnesses gives you reports from all the nations where Branch organizations are established, and from other countries where representatives have been working. In order to show how thousands upon thousands of persons have been working peacefully to make glad others with Jehovah’s witnesses, you must read the amazing story. It is as thrilling as the acts of the apostles, for today “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” and the people must and will be told of this fact, by Jehovah’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses’ service year was climaxed with the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly in Cleveland, Ohio, August 4-11. This was the most blessed occasion Jehovah’s witnesses of many nations ever enjoyed together in study and meditation on the Lord’s Word and in making preparation for expansion and reconstruction. There were representatives from thirty-three different nations at this convention. Prayers arose unto God in all nations where Jehovah’s witnesses live in behalf of this united assembly, and such prayers were answered. The sixty-odd thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses that were able to gather together were greatly favored of the Lord, for he poured out upon them a blessing so rich that it was impossible for anyone to contain it all. The assembled multitude felt as though they had entered into a New World. There was peace, unity, tranquillity—all these servants of God, being of one mind and having one hope, assembled together in the Cleveland Stadium. Jesus said concerning his faithful followers, We are in the world, but not of it.’ (John 15:19; 17:15,16; 1 Cor. 5:9,10) But for a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">moment the conventioners felt that they were not even in the old world, let alone ‘of it’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, all assembled fully appreciated their responsibility and knew that they were still in this old world, with very definite obligations to fulfill. The need for expansion and reconstruction was felt by everyone. There was still work to be done; yes, work to be done in every country. Branch servants and representatives from all the nations gave proof of this. When we heard from their lips what some of Jehovah’s witnesses had to endure during the war years and since, it made one reflect: “Have I done all that I could? Can I make 1947 a better service year?” Yes, the prayer and hope of fully consecrated servants of the Most High were that they might redeem the time. Their expressions were: “Here am I; send me.” “I can be a better company publisher.” “I can arrange my time to be a better pioneer.” “When I get to my missionary assignment, I’ll make a go of it. I’ll study the language diligently and preach the gospel where-ever I’m sent.” “Yes, there are people, people everywhere, who must still hear this message. Why, even my very own neighbor needs to hear!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So everyone can begin at home with his own expansion work, and make glad the nations. The power, unity and strength of God’s visible organization was seen because all knew that “God is with us”. His spirit was manifested upon all sessions of the assembly, and his people were glad. The expansion work outlined was to affect every publisher, every company, every part of the world. Definite arrangements were made to assist all who desire to praise Jehovah. One forward step taken was the preparation for sending servants to the brethren into circuits comprised of twenty companies. These servants to the brethren are to help the individual company publisher, teaching and training him to be a better servant in the local missionary work. From time to time all companies in the circuit will assemble in convention to discuss ways and means of taking care of the territory more effectively and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">efficiently. This not only related to the United States; for these plans are to be effective world-wide. All the territory that can possibly be reached, cities and rural regions, is to be taken into consideration in the arranging of these circuits. Additionally, it was announced that two assemblies are to be arranged each year for every circuit, assemblies on a somewhat smaller scale than at Cleveland, but assemblies where the Lord’s spirit would be just as manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God made mankind of one blood and has called to his service persons from all nations, kindreds and tongues. No, there are no barriers in the Lord’s organization. These were all destroyed by Jehovah God’s pouring out upon all people his holy spirit, that is, upon all consecrated, justified servants of the Most High. These are now going forward in the service year 1947 with the glad song upon their lips, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”—Ps. 117:1, A.S.P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So much could be said about the Glad Nations Assembly—the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine; the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font5"> and its invaluable features for the aid of all publishers; the working book for the field, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;;</span><span class="font5"> the service meeting; the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study; the discourses. All these things were so good! The details have been set forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> As time goes on, if it should happen that we forget the details, there is one thing that Jehovah’s people will never forget: that they must in these last days stand as ‘signs and wonders’ before all the world, following the Peacemaker, doing his will and accepting the lead of “The Prince of Peace”. Without question there is much to be done. The Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly showed Jehovah’s witnesses that this is no time to step aside, but a time to move forward. They are doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As radiant beams of light from the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland reflect from other assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses gathered world-wide weeks and months after Cleveland’s convention, just so the message of “The Prince of Peace” spoken by his servants in the earth will reach unto the ends of the earth. The truths received at the Cleveland assembly and expressed before some 80,000 persons will be repeated time and time again throughout the world by the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. The same spirit that Jehovah God poured out upon his people and with which he guided his servants at the Glad Nations Assembly will guide, direct and aid the Lord’s people in all parts of the world. The joy of Jehovah’s witnesses, their unity, their oneness of purpose, their peace of mind, which were so manifest at this Glad Nations Assembly, will be revealed in the people of good-will and they too will praise Jehovah in all the nations. The truth that “God is with us” can never be disputed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the most favored nation of the earth as far as the necessities of life are concerned, a good witness to the Kingdom has been given. The majority of publishers in the United States have been consistent in their preaching of the gospel. They have been rewarded richly because they have been seeking first the Kingdom interests. God’s blessing falls upon all earnest publishers of the Kingdom throughout the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America’s prosperity has evidently been a hindrance to some of the Kingdom publishers, because, as the records show, there were not on the average as many publishers out in the field service during the service year 1946 as compared with 1945. There is not much change, but it does seem to indicate that some who had been holding high the banner of truth have become too much weighted down with the things of this world. It is very evident from the many reports received from all parts of the United States that thousands upon thousands of newly interested persons are taking up the preaching work. This being true, who has slacked his hand? At the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland there were 2,602 brethren immersed, symbolizing their consecration to serve God and take up the preaching of the gospel. Should there not have been an increase? Reports are received that the public meetings have had a splendid effect upon the people in general, telling how many have taken their stand. Why, then, even a slight decline in publishers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is proper that we look at the issue squarely and ask, “Well, if several thousand more persons have taken up the preaching of the gospel alongside of Jehovah’s witnesses, why has there not been a large increase?” Have the cares of this world weighted some down to a point of neglecting the big thing in a Christian’s life? Have some turned aside for the moment, expecting to come back later, looking for a more favorable time to preach? Hundreds, yes, thousands that have been released from prison have taken up the ministry work again. These are included in the report of publishers. Is the life of a Christian too strenuous? Have the attractions of the world too strong a pull? There will always be some stepping aside as long as the Devil is free to turn them aside. Their places will be filled by others and their privileges taken care of by someone else. There is a great danger in having put your hand to the plow and then turning back. It isn’t worth it. Integrity and life mean more than temporary gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good admonition is, Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, especially in these last days, during the perilous times. (Heb. 10:25) It is believed that the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly, and the new organizational setup with servants to the brethren for circuits, and circuit assemblies, will be an aid to all faithful servants to stand firm and may help those who have stepped aside for a season. These brethren should be helped, by the Lord’s grace. All Christians are charged to look well to the interests of their brethren, and to build their brethren up in the most holy faith, thus showing love for their neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been observed that in the countries where trials and difficulties have been the hardest there is often found the greatest increase. Is it because the people need more comfort in those lands ? No; they need just as much in the lands where there is no suffering physically and where there is no shortage of material things. The Kingdom is the only hope for the world, and there is always the need of preaching the gospel. There is always need for those who love righteousness to stay close to the Lord, to seek his counsel and work with his organization, and to abide with one another in peace. These are points that all publishers for the Kingdom do well to meditate upon, especially those who are slacking the hand; for now is the time to “praise Jehovah, all ye nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Portions of the Branch servant’s report on the United States are set out here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One factor that influenced the activity of the publishers during the year was the release of the revised </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font4"> Effective October 1, 1945, this booklet was supplied to the publishers throughout the country, it being the first time that the individual publisher had a personal copy of such. As a result of this, better understanding of the operation of the organization is had by all. The instructions clarified and co-ordinated many features of the service activity, which before were comparatively obscure, and make all features of the service uniformly applicable to every part of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One campaign which was carried on right at the beginning of the year, September, was the extensive distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> No. 678, of September 12, 1945, containing the article “Jehovah’s witnesses Triumph over Concentration Camps”. Though regular news channels had entirely ignored these facts, nevertheless this issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">was distributed widely throughout the country, bringing the information to the people. In addition to being presented on the streets, in stores, and at the homes of the people, copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were served upon all municipal, state and federal officials either by mail or by direct contact. Some of the officials were very vicious in their denunciation of Jehovah’s witnesses when acknowledging this. Still others were quite sympathetic, as, for example, in the case of one U. S. senator, who had also received a copy of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font4"> and who expressed the wish that one billion copies of that book might be distributed. A big majority did not make acknowledgment at all, but the witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding campaign of the year was, of course, the four-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign which showed a tremendous increase over any previous campaign. This is a good indication of the Increase of the witness work. A quota of 150,000 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions was set at the beginning of the campaign for the United States alone. After the first month of the campaign the Brooklyn office had received nearly twice as many subscriptions as for the same month during the previous year’s campaign. By the end of the campaign a total of 243,523 subscriptions had been reported for the United States, of which more than 200,000 were new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. So, of the 285,020 reported for the year in this country, over 240,000 subscriptions were taken during the campaign. Yearly this magazine is becoming more widespread in its distribution, and this we know will be of great comfort and enlightenment to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then there was the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”.</span><span class="font4"> This message, heralded forth in the midst of world turmoil with strife between nations, races and classes, was most appropriate. The booklet was released at the Baltimore assembly in February, and by April its worldwide distribution had begun in conjunction with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. This booklet was delivered to all government officials, and at a time when the United Nations organization was getting off to a ‘fighting’ start here in this country. What a contrast with the gladsome message in the booklet!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A review of the preaching work for the past year would be incomplete without mentioning the three very effective assemblies held. A great witness is always given by such assemblies and many people come in contact with the work even though this will not always appear on a field service report. The Ohio State Assembly, held at Cleveland, September 29 and 30, 1945, started off the year, and though this was a local affair, many attended and a good witness was given. Next was the Northeastern Seaboard Assembly, held in Baltimore, Md., February 8-10, 1946, following Brother Knorr’s return from Europe. The brethren eagerly anticipated a report on the condition of the Lord’s people in Europe, and this was most enthusiastically received. Many people of good-will who were there were publishers within a short time. It is noticed, too, that our activity during the early part of the year showed an increase in publishers of well over 2,000 a month. Undoubtedly the first two conventions contributed greatly to the increase. But this was only the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of the year, and, no doubt, of many years, was the Glad Nations Assembly held In Cleveland. Of international scope, this assembly was publicized throughout the country and eventually throughout the world, both by representation of our brethren and report by newspapers, magazines, newsreels and radio. The peak of this assembly was the delivery of the highly-advertised talk, “The Prince of Peace,” which was presented to more than 80,000 persons assembled in the mammoth Cleveland Stadium and Its environs. This however, does not begin to show the great witness given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For months before the assembly the brethren were busy telling their good-will people about the assembly and arranging for them to attend. Others were telling their employers about it and arranging for time off. Special trains, buses, and even planes were provided, and all of this involved giving a witness. Then, with the traveling under way by car, train, and all ways, coming from all parts of the country the brethren advertised. People all over the continent were hearing about the Glad Nations Assembly as the vast multitude of the Glad Nations converged upon Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Evidence of the Kingdom message put in its appearance all around Cleveland, from the huge sign on the stadium, on the streets, in the hotels and restaurants, at tlie doors of the people, and in the thousands of homes which were opened to accommodate our brethren. Following the great witness given within Cleveland, the brethren returned to whence they had come; and, having been supplied with further information, copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">and other publications, they departed, leaving in their wake additional testimony as to the Glad Nation and its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another feature of our year’s witness work is embodied in the public lecture campaign. This showed an increase over the previous year of 10.7 percent in the average number of public meetings per month, and an increase of over 14 percent in the number of companies participating. The provision of new outlines for the year was a welcome change and provided stimulus to this feature. The public lectures are the means of getting the people of good-will associated witli the organization as well as bringing our work to the attention of all people. During the last year 78,396,900 handbills were supplied by local printers, the Brooklyn factory, and depots, advertising a total of 28,703 public talks. The handbills had a short message printed on the back and a coupon for obtaining one of our publications. Those millions of handbills gave an extensive witness, and the office was constantly receiving the coupons In request for literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attendance at these meetings was not recorded, but the brethren did report good success with anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of the attendees being newly interested persons. The meetings were held whenever the public could be assembled. There were halls rented, vacant stores, schools, courthouses and parks employed. On numerous occasions pressure would be put on those in charge to cancel the agreement with Jehovah’s witnesses. In the long run, however, this was to our advantage; for, while a few cancellations were made, most persons insisted that we be given our rights. In the cases where halls were canceled, the un-American course taken was a witness in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While there is no over-all increase in all features of the work, the reasons for which are best known to those who did not publish, yet the report set out below is the work of hundreds and thousands of faithful individual publishers, many of whom are new; and it represents much work in itself, much planning on the part of the brethren to cope with conditions, and thousands of verbal witnesses and experiences at the door, in the homes of the people, and on the streets. The total results may be seen herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done in the United States. The territory is very large. With gasoline rationing removed and automobiles coming back on the road, it is expected that much good work will be accomplished in the service year 1947 in the rural districts of America. Not too much of this work has been done during the past four years, because of restrictions on travel and shortage of gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1,049 special pioneers reporting regularly throughout the year have done good work. From their ranks many of the Gilead students have been called, and hundreds of them have been sent out of the country to take up missionary work. Those that remain, In most cases however, are working in small towns and cities where there are no companies located. An excellent witness has been given during the past year. Thirty-four new companies have been organized through their efforts. They have completed their work in 255 different communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie territory for general pioneers is large. On the average there were 2,684 working regularly each month, although many more than this number have been enrolled during the year. The vacation pioneers accomplished excellent work during their short season of full-time service In the summer. Here is a field open to all persons who can gather together approximately 150 hours per month to preach the gospel. It takes real faith to make this forward step and enter the pioneer work, but one will never know of its joys and pleasures until he gets into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not necessary to go into a foreign country and learn another language in order to be a real pioneer. Missionary work can be carried on right at home, in the very block in which you live. Your getting territory near your home makes it convenient to put in one or two spare hours each day. By so doing it will not take one very long to find enough time to get in the pioneer requirements. When you consider the reports in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font4"> setting out the trials and difficulties that other people have gone through in order to maintain their Integrity and serve God faithfully, the pioneer service in this country does not appear to be such a great hardship, but a joy, as is all full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the added privileges of service that ministers of the Society had during the war years was that of visiting the brethren in prison. Arrangements were made by the Society to send representatives to 28 different prisons where our brethren were incarcerated. These brethren were built up in the most holy faith. Within the prisons the brethren were organized to carry on the regular book studies and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> studies, and in many places they were able to arrange for public meetings within the prisons for the benefit of other persons incarcerated there. The report on legal matters, written by the Society’s legal advisor, is very interesting in this regard, and his report is set out below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year in the United States many brethren continued to remain in prison for righteousness’ sake. (1 Pet. 3:14) This grim fact stands as a monument that Jehovah’s witnesses still suffer persecutions in this “land of the free”. (2 Tim. 3: 12) Refusal to give up their covenant obligations while in prison, and their re-entry into regular and active work of discipling of all nations immediately upon their release from prison, showed that they have overcome persecution. In fact, they defeated it and proved the Devil to be a liar by their redeeming the time, many by increasing their preaching time from that of company publishers to pioneers, upon release from prison. Their being joyfully joined in the grand work by those faithful ones who filled up the ranks by increased preaching during years of their enforced absence through imprisonment showed the whole world that nothing can break the love of Jehovah’s witnesses for Jehovah and for one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These men, by their faithfulness under bonds, helped to carry to a climax, during the year just ended, the long and continuous five-year battle in the federal courts between the Department of Justice of the United States government and Jehovah’s wdtnesses. This fight has been waged over the claim of Jehovah’s witnesses for the right to show that draft-board orders they refused to comply with were illegal. More than 4,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses, claiming exemption from training and service as ministers of religion because of their regular missionary preaching, were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to prison under the Selective Training and Service Act. In court they were refused the right to show that the draft boards violated the Act in ordering them to submit to training and service. A summary of that important fight for liberty of making one’s defense in court should now become a matter of record, here, to the world. Thus those interested in having the truth may know the issues and facts leading up to the predicament into which Jehovah’s witnesses were illegally thrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Section 5 (d) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 provides for the exemption of ministers of religion. Section 622.44 of the Selective Service Regulations, promulgated under the Act, states that regular or duly ordained ministers of religion, exempt from all training and service under the Act, should by draft boards be classified IV-D. Jehovah’s witnesses, being missionary evangelists preaching the gospel in primitive fashion as did Christ Jesus and his apostles, claimed their exemption as ministers of religion under the Act and Regulations. Although Selective Service National Headquarters issued a favorable opinion concerning the ministerial status of Jehovah’s witnesses many draft boards arbitrarily and capriciously refused to classify some four thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses as ministers. Accordingly, when ordered to report, those men refused, in hope of being able, in court, to establish their exemption under the Act when called upon to defend against indictments charging them with violation of draft-board orders commanding them to report for induction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the controversy in these cases, more than five years ago, federal courts uniformly held that no defense was available to Jehovah’s witnesses, in response to the indictments. The Department of Justice, capitulating to war-hysteria passion, contended that every registrant, including the vice-president of the United States, members of Congress, judges and ministers of religion—all exempt by law—must, if illegally classified by any local board, first submit to induction and then apply for a writ of habeas corpus as the only means of getting judicial relief from illegal classifications given by the draft boards. Lower federal courts blindly accepted this, declaring it to be the law of the land. This made it impossible, of course, for Jehovah’s witnesses to put up in their cases the defense that they are ministers of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From 1941 to February 1946 every judge (except one) of every federal court of appeals in over one hundred test cases, and every judge of every federal district court in over four thousand cases there tried, uniformly held that one who failed to submit to induction and then to apply for writ of habeas corpus was not entitled to judicial review when indicted for failure to report for induction or submit to induction. In January 1944 the Supreme Court, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United. States,</span><span class="font4"> decided that one of Jehovah’s witnesses who failed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to go to</span><span class="font4"> a camp or induction center and take a second physical examination could not challenge the validity of a draft-board order in defense to an indictment. The court’s failure to clarify in its </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font4"> opinion precisely what it meant in that case merely aggravated the situation. Repeatedly thereafter the district courts and appellate courts held that the Supreme Court approved the Illegal doctrine that it was necessary for one to submit to induction as a condition precedent to challenging an illegal draft-board order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the mountain of precedent and the continued opposition from the Department of Justice, counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses persisted by test cases in the claim that it was not necessary to submit to induction to qualify for judicial review of the challenged illegal classification by a draft board. It was argued that at some point along the line before induction a registrant should be entitled to be heard in his defense that he was a minister of religion not subject to the Act, and that he could show that the draft board had no jurisdiction to order him to submit to Induction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, in November 1945, new cases involving Jehovah’s witnesses, styled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Smith</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United States</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Estep</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United States,</span><span class="font4"> were accepted and heard by the Supreme Court There, on February 4, 1946, the court held that one who had completed the selective process upon preinduction physical examination would be entitled to challenge the draftboard order in defense to the indictment. That 6-to-2 decision by the Supreme Court in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses reversed the judgments of conviction in those two cases. Justice Frankfurter, in a special concurring opinion, said that the Supreme Court, by this decision, had reversed all the federal circuit and district judges in the United States, declaring that the court charged all such judges with having erroneously construed the Act and Regulations. Justice Frankfurter also pointed out that the convictions of over four thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses under the Act were void, saying: “ . . . not only were they [federal courts] wrong, but probably hundreds of convictions for disobedience of local board orders . . . were invalid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">it is manifest that the misconstruction of the Selective Training and Service Act, so as to deny Jehovah’s witnesses the right to show they were ministers of religion, in defense to the indictment, is a denial of due process of law and of a judicial trial in each of those thousands of convictions, on the erroneous interpretation of the Act. Inasmuch as thousands of these men did not take appeals, and many others served their time in federal prisons and have been discharged, it was impossible to do anything in their behalf in the courts with respect to their “criminal” status that remains as a heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only remedy available to them was through application for executive clemency, the president’s exercise of his powers of pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On August 10, 1946, in Cleveland, Ohio, at the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, more than sixty thousand persons unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the president of the United States exercise his powers of executive clemency in behalf of the four thousand missionaries convicted under the Act. It requested that they be granted full pardon, restoring their civil rights. That resolution, together with a statement containing a history of the treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses under the Act, Iras been personally presented to President Truman. He took it under advisement and reserved decision. If the decision is favorable, he will publicly announce it. If the request is not granted, perhaps no statement will be made by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a few cases, to establish judicially, if possible, the invalidity of these convictions, habeas corpus proceedings have been instituted in federal courts. These test cases are now on the way through the circuit courts of appeals to the Supreme Court. In addition to fighting many cases in the courts, in trying to protect the rights of some of these thousands of men (which actions did effect release of but very few), dealings administratively have been carried on with the United States Board of Parole at Washington, D.C., in an endeavor to get Jehovah’s witnesses released from prison. About two thousand men served their time and were unconditionally released. Through efforts made before the Board of Parole approximately one thousand men were released from prison to resume pioneer work or continue as company publishers. No compromise paroles were accepted. However, now there remain incarcerated in federal institutions approximately thirteen hundred men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has been a long and bitter fight. It is not yet fully ended. Many other cases remain to be fought. The victory thus far gained by Jehovah’s witnesses has been not only for the benefit of the bar but for the public as a whole. Moreover, the persistent fight against the nefarious doctrine successfully declared by the lower federal courts has resulted in restoring confidence in the judicial process and in the independence of the judiciary when confronted with demands of executive agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In October 1945 the Supreme Court brought in for review another draft case known as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gibson</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United States. </span><span class="font4">Gibson was charged with violation of the Act by refusal to stay at a civilian public service camp after reporting there to take a physical examination. It was believed necessary for him to do this so as to exhaust his administrative remedies in accordance with the rule announced in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United States.</span><span class="font4"> During January 1946 the Supreme Court heard the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gibson</span><span class="font4"> case argued, but it reached no decision because the government argued he went “too far”. In the spring of 1946, another draft case, involving another of Jehovah’s witnesses wrongly classified as a conscientious objector refusing to report, was accepted by the Supreme Court for review. This case, styled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dodez</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United States, </span><span class="font4">is identical to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font4"> case. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dodez</span><span class="font4"> case will be argued during the fall of 1946 along with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gibson</span><span class="font4"> case, which the Supreme Court has ordered reargued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year, printed briefs (written arguments) and printed appeal papers have been prepared in more than thirteen draft cases pending in federal appellate courts. Six printed petitions to the Supreme Court of the United States for certiorari to review decisions of the lower federal courts in draft cases were prepared. They are pending now. The cases involve new questions under the draft law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Printed briefs and appeal papers have been prepared In seven cases directly involving the witness work. There were only thirty-five new arrests under state laws and ordinances because of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom during the past year. This is the smallest number of prosecutions directly challenging the right to preach the gospel since 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year two significant victories were won under the Bill of Rights in the Supreme Court of the United States. A further step extending the constitutional field of freedom of worship was made in these cases. In January 1946, in cases styled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Marsh</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Alabama</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tucker</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Texas,</span><span class="font4"> the Supreme Court of the United States held that landlords of housing projects and owners of company-operated towns were forbidden by the Constitution to arrest and prosecute Jehovah’s witnesses under trespass statutes for carrying on door-to-door witness work and making street distribution of magazines, contrary to the wishes of such landlords and owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The decisions in those cases were promptly defied by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the world’s largest financial corporation and insurance company, owner of Parkchester in The Bronx, New York city. Parkchester is the largest privately-owned housing project in the world. The one hundred fifty-two apartment buildings in the project, owned by Metropolitan, house approximately forty thousand persons. The management of the project enforced regulations prohibiting Jehovah’s witnesses from calling from door to door in the apartment buildings. Instead of causing Jehovah’s witnesses to be arrested, the private police of Parkchester deported them from the buildings and premises. It was necessary for the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., and Jehovah’s witnesses to sue the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, asking stoppage of these acts. The action was brought to have the regulation declared invalid and to restrain the interference with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Parkchester. The case was tried during the greater part of the month of May 1946 in New York Supreme Court. It was taken under advisement by the judge. lie reserved decision. No ruling has been made at the close of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another significant victory was attained by a favorable decision from the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in the case of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">State</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wagner.</span><span class="font4"> In that case one of Jehovah’s witnesses was convicted under an anti-annoyance statute of the state because he persisted in making back-calls upon a person of good-will in a rooming house, contrary to the wishes of the owner. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that the conduct of one of Jehovah’s witnesses involved in the case did not constitute a violation of the statute. The prosecution was ordered dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It Is manifest that, although the Lord has given his servants the victory in one field of battle with the enemy, the war with the enemy has not ended. Simultaneous with, indeed even before the victory in the license-tax and flag-salute cases of 1943, the battle began in connection with other mischief framed under the draft law. Although the year just ended seemed to have produced a decided victory, climaxing the five-year struggle under the Selective Service law, it is apparent that there remain ahead many battles in this field before the final results will be known. From all this it is obvious that the experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses during the past several years, and especially the one just ended, prove that the war with the enemy to keep the field of worship clear will not end until Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE BROOKLYN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scattered about in thirteen different countries and islands of the sea there are 199 publishers who report regularly to the Brooklyn office. These brethren are doing very good work. Last year there were publishers scattered in twenty different nations, but it was found advisable during the year to organize some of these brethren under the Branch arrangement. Therefore their reports will appear in the Branch report of their respective countries. When graduates of Gilead are sent to a territory that has not been worked before, these brethren report direct to the Brooklyn office until such time as it seems advisable to establish a Branch office. What these brethren from Gilead and other brethren have done in foreign lands is recorded under the country in which they serve.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font4">For the size of this territory, there are not many inhabitants. The people who are there, it appears, are more interested in this world’s goods and pleasures than in the kingdom of God. The special pioneers that were sent to Alaska over a year ago find it very difficult to interest people in home Bible study. They take the literature; but to take their Bibles and settle down to a careful study with Jehovah’s witnesses is not the kind of life the majority of them want to lead. Despite the tendency toward worldliness we do see an increase of publishers in that land. Last year there were 10 serving the interests of the Kingdom; this year 19 are proclaiming the message. There are publishers in Ketchikan, Juneau, Anchorage and Fairbanks. Four companies are now organized. There are other isolated publishers too, and whenever possible they are visited by the Gilead graduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year these 19 servants of the Lord devoted 12,901 hours to field service, and distributed 9,221 books and booklets. The magazines seem to go well in Alaska, for they placed 8,037 individual copies and took 331 subscriptions. The brethren are putting forth a very earnest effort to make back-calls; but even though we have more publishers now, fewer baek-ealls are being made. Only 30 book studies are being conducted regularly each week. This shows the indifference on the part of the people toward the message of truth. The effort is put forth; that is assured, and Jehovah is blessing our brethren there. They are putting up a real fight; and we want to give the population of that land a full opportunity to praise Jehovah if any more there choose to do so before the final battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>BERMUDA AND THE BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Some work continues to be done in these islands. It is passing strange that the British government should not lift the official ban prohibiting the Importation of literature into the Bahamas. What they have to fear, no one knows. Is it that the mighty British Empire fears three publishers in the Bahamas? Can three persons on a small island frighten a whole empire to the point where the government sees fit to deny them freedom of speech, freedom of worship and freedom of the press? Maybe someday the few publishers of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Bahama islands will be given greater freedom. However, a report comes through that they are still talking, making back-calls on interested people, and placing what little literature enters the islands through one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font4">Bolivia is the third-largest country in South America, but up to this past year we have had no regular representatives holding high the banner of truth in that land. It is estimated that the population of this country is 34 million, one-third of whom are Indians. In the city of La Paz, which has a population of a little more than 300,000, are located special pioneer publishers, graduates from Gilead. Early in the service year the first two pioneers started their work, and later additional workers were sent by the Society to join them. A missionary home has been established. Two company publishers have associated themselves with the pioneers, making a small study group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Excellent distribution of literature has been accomplished during the year, 4,070 books and booklets being placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thirteen hundred back-calls have been made, and 29 book studies are conducted regularly by the two pioneers. The year 1947 should bring forth good results, with the additional publishers in that vast territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Reports have been coming in regularly from this Mediterranean island, and the tabulation for the year shows that 28 publishers are in the field, 4 of whom are pioneers. These brethren placed 9,402 books and booklets during the year, devoting 10,000 hours to the field service. A considerable number of back-calls were made during the past twelve months, namely, 2,258. The publishers of the Kingdom in Cyprus enthusiastically welcomed the rescinding of the ban on the Society’s literature in May, 1945. Sinee then they have been carrying on the preaching work witii the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the Society’s plan to send a brother to Cyprus, one who has graduated from Gilead. He speaks the Greek language, and we believe he will be a great aid to the brethren there and will help them get reorganized for further service. There are nearly 400,000 persons living on this island of 148 miles in length and from 15 to 40 miles in width.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Many centuries ago the great God of heaven took his witnesses out of this land with a miraculous demonstration of power, and led them into the Promised Land. He performed a great witness at the Red sea. Today there are only a few of Jehovah’s witnesses in that vast territory. The 63 faithful servants have distributed 12,638 books and booklets during the past year, and have devoted 20,912 hours to the field service. This is a marvelous increase over the previous year’s report, during which time the publishers devoted only 9.440 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three companies are organized within the land, but there is plenty of room for expansion. Most people think of Egypt as a great desert territory, but there are 17,287,000 people living in the land of the Pharaohs who need to hear about the truth. The Society is putting forth every effort to send some graduates of Gilead to Egypt to help the brethren in their field activity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This is a French colony in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies. It consists of two islands, Guadeloupe proper and Grande-Terre, separated by a narrow channel. The population of this territory is 304,000, and the Society has only eight representatives to look after this population. They are doing the very best they can, devoting 4,099 hours to the field service. As to literature, not much has been placed; but the brethren in this territory are putting forth a real effort. It is hoped that arrangements can be made to send some French-speaking people to Guadeloupe to assist our brethren there in better organization and in carrying this good news of the Kingdom to the people of the Islands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For many years one lone pioneer has been working steadily in this northern territory. There are about 125,000 people to be visited regularly, and our one pioneer devotes 1,215 hours in a year to the preaching of the gospel. Last year he placed 5,330 books and booklets. Even though he has been working there for many years, he has been unable to establish a company. His report shows that he has only one book study going. It is our sincere hope that he will soon find more people of good-will, so that a company organization can be started in the principal city.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the Society tried to open up the work in Liberia by sending a graduate from Gilead to that country. While he was in the territory he did very well, placing well over a thousand books and booklets. In the short time Brother Behannan was in the territory he found good interest. However, he was taken ill suddenly and succumbed after a few days’ confinement in the hospital. He finished his course faithfully. In the few short months of his residence In Monrovia he established many friendships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hoped that we shall be able to send more missionaries into that territory, which is known as The Negro Republic. Liberia is on the west coast of Africa, and there are between lj and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2%</span><span class="font4"> million people living within the boundaries of the country. The Society hopes to carry on the work where Brother Behannan left off.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society sent four graduates of the Watchtower School to Curasao, one of the islands of the Netherlands West Indies group in the Caribbean sea. They have done excellent work in the short time they have been there, finding many who had been publishing the truth before their arrival and others who are anxious to associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses. The report for the year shows 19 publishers in the field, putting in 2,651 hours of field service and placing 3,353 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneer publishers are doing very well In their back-call activity, averaging 12 book studies weekly. Company publishers have been encouraged to carry on book studies, too, and have organized 10 of such. We have every reason to believe that a wonderful witness will be accomplished by the servants of the Lord in these islands. The principal language is Dutch, and there appear to be many people who have a hearing ear.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are two company publishers in this land. During the year they devoted 507 hours to field service and placed 851 bound books and booklets. They are isolated and would very much like to have assistance. Someday the way may be opened whereby other publishers can be sent into that territory. Today it is filled with strife and turmoil, and very few of the Jews or Arabs are looking to the Lord for salvation and deliverance. They want to establish a kingdom their own way and have rejected God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>SYRIA AND LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A very good witness has been given in these lands compared with former years. Now there are 40 publishers preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. They devoted 8,181 hours to field service, and distributed 8,380 books and booklets. The back-call work is being carried on by the publishers, but they have not become book-study-minded sufficiently. Undoubtedly with better organization a great witness can be given throughout this territory. It has always been a fertile field for the placing of literature, but the literature placed should be followed up by the publisher. The obtainer should be encouraged to study it with the publisher for the Kingdom. This method has always brought results. It is hoped that in the coming year more of the company publishers will pursue the method outlined in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font4"> Those in the field are having very interesting experiences. Many people are forsaking their churches, because there is no life in them, and are listening to the servants of the Lord Instead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This country is very prosperous. People seem to have all they want of this world’s goods, and it is an expensive country in which to live. However, the few publishers of the Kingdom there have put forth an earnest effort during the year to spread the gospel message. The Society sent some graduates from the Watchtower Bible School to Venezuela and they are assisting the brethren in organizing as well as going ahead with the preaching of the gospel. Thirteen publishers devoted 4,368 hours to field-service work during the past year, and they distributed 5,173 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the good pleasure of the president and the vicepresident of the Society to spend some time with the pub-lishcrs in Caracas, Venezuela. A convention was held there during the year, and a most enjoyable time was had. Good interest was shown by many who had recently come to a knowledge of the truth. Several were immersed during the president’s visit and they have since taken up the preaching of the gospel. We hope that a Branch organization will soon be arranged so that greater attention can be given to the work yet to be done In Venezuela.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Splendid progress has been made in this country in advancing the Kingdom interests. During the service year the publishers surpassed their previous peaks five different times, until they reached a new peak of 622 persons in the field during one month. The reason for such heartening progress seems to be the appreciation on the part of the publishers in Argentina of the new organization instructions which have gone into effect there, particularly with reference to the following up of back-calls with book studies. The book studies reached a peak of 413 weekly during the month of August. Those who have heard the truth are trying to make glad the people of Argentina, and to do this they have accomplished a magnificent increase in hours devoted to field service, as the report shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers are not without their difficulties and trials. Argentina is a Catholic country; but they have gone forward fearlessly preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. Recently the government of Argentina required all religious organizations to register with the federal state. What the outcome will be, no one knows as yet; but it is certain that those who have heard the good news of God’s kingdom will continue to study it and call on all the nations to praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been a real pleasure to have three of the Argentine brethren with us in the Bethel home for some time. Two have graduated from Gilead and have received additional training in the Brooklyn office. Just before the convention Brother Muniz, the Branch servant, was invited to come to America and he too has received special instruction in the Bethel home and the factory. We feel sure that their stay with us will prove to be a blessing to our fellow brethren in Argentina when the three representatives return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brother in Argentina looking after the work in the absence of the Branch servant sends in a very interesting report, portions of which follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year for 1945-6 will remain a dear one in the hearts of the publishers in this country, for it marked the beginning of what might be called a new era of work. September 9 saw the first lesson in Theocratic ministry being studied in most of the companies, thus providing for the eager brethren a real help to be more efficient ministers and witnesses to the Most High God. That was only the start. Then came the 29th of Octobei- and a surprise to many people on the streets. Street witnessing with magazine bags and a bold inscription on them, a work that had always been considered impossible in Argentina! Even now some brethren think it cannot be done where they are, but the reports speak for themselves. The total number of magazines placed during the last year was 13,221, and these jumped to 27,041 this year. Is not that enough proof that this work has been and still is being blessed by the Lord? It is a means which the Lord has provided to make known his kingdom and to make the nations glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But that is not all. January 1 introduced the public meeting campaign in this country. Another means and opportunity to publicly present the good news of God’s kingdom to the hungry people in this Catholic and clergy-ridden country. The people here need very much to be fed with real nourishment from God’s Word. He knows that, and so provided this new work, which was received with many signs of gladness by the brethren. Some of them said, “You will never be able to hand out handbills without drawing the attention of the police and clergy and be taken to jail. That cannot be done here. It is all right for the States, but never here.” Others answered “So what?” and went right ahead with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Obeying the instructions that the Lord passes through his “servant” is a most blessed and joyous thing and brings forth fruit. A small company with an average then of only 16 publishers wrote during June, saying, “On Saturday we had 70 persons attending our public meeting and all were enthusiastic. Next day at our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study there were 55 in attendance.” That was not all. That same company reported two months later a peak in publishers: 33 during August and one new pioneer, with six about to become such, one in September and the rest in October. Their town is too small, so they go out now to “other towns” because they do not fit in it. That company did not exist till June 1945. The Lord’s guidance, together with an enthusiastic and wholehearted support of the meeting, did that even in Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers are getting into stride with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> which for this country are in operation only since Brother Knorr’s visit during March last year, and are therefore quite new. The back-calls are being stressed and the publishers are appreciating the importance of this work. Not the placing of literature is of the most importance, but rather it is only the start of the work with a person of good-will. That explains why back-calls jumped from 12,273 to 43,224 in one year. The publishers see that the territory cannot be considered thoroughly worked unless each house has been witnessed to and back-calls made wherever interest is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jehovah of hosts has been with us during the year. Many blessings have been received. Our dearly loved Brother Mufilz, the Branch servant, was invited to attend and represent the brethren from Argentina at the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly at Cleveland. Our hearts and prayers went with him, and we are all anxiously awaiting his return to have direct information regarding that blessed event. Also, we are expecting our two brethren who received Gilead training to help us on with our work. We need that help, and the Lord has graciously provided.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has established a depot in Paraguay, which comes under the direction of the Argentine office. Some brethren who are graduates of Gilead have been sent to Paraguay recently, and there are now 10 of such special pioneers in that country. Arrangements have been made to put Paraguay on a Branch basis for the next service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Paraguayans are interesting people. They are a proud people and it takes a little time to gain their confidence. But undoubtedly, as in all other nations, there are “other sheep”, people of good-will, who will seek after truth and righteousness. The annual service report for 1946 shows that there are 25 publishers in the field, to compare with an average of 21 last year. Instead of putting in only 3,402 hours, the publishers devoted 11,345 hours to the field work, placing 7,362 books and booklets. Back-calls are really on the increase, jumping from 675 to 3,077. Book studies are being conducted, especially by the special pioneers. Four companies are organized, and the number of publishers reached the peak of 34. Now that 10 brethren from Gilead are in the land it is expected that a great witness will be given in 1947.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The good news of the Kingdom continues to go out in this territory “down under” and many people are being made glad with Jehovah’s witnesses there. The Bethel family is very energetic and active in the field service, averaging 28.4 hours each month in preaching the gospel and 5.2 back-calls per publisher. This is good work for the family, in addition to their other duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As will be noted there is another drop in publishers in Australia compared with the previous year. Is it that here too, with the war’s end now past, those who have made a covenant to serve God are becoming lax and are taking up vocations which they consider more important than preaching the gospel ’ The Devil works in many ways. Often when he tries to break up the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses during times of war and stress he fails, because God’s servants put their full trust in Him for preservation, and He does preserve them. But when this pressure is momentarily removed by the Devil and his organization some lose sight of Jehovah’s continued care of those who desire to serve Him. Those in Australia remaining steadfast and true to their mission have enjoyed marvelous experiences, and they will continue to enjoy these as they assist the peoples of many nationalities in Australia to praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in America had the good pleasure of hearing the Branch servant from Australia deliver a talk at the Glad Nations Assembly. This servant is now being trained at Gilead and will later receive further instruction in the Brooklyn office. Two American brethren who have served many, many years in full-time service in the United States were sent to Australia to assist in the servant to the brethren work in the circuits. This new work will soon be inaugurated there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report of the temporary Branch servant is very interesting, and excerpts therefrom are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the report is less than the previous year in the main items, such as publishers, hours and back-call activity, there are signs that the work is on the increase again. The totals of literature and magazine placements are the highest since 1940, and subscriptions are the highest on record. The printed message, at least, is circulating as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adelaide, South Australia, “the city of churches,” continues to distinguish itself as the leading exponent of superpatriotism. When the Adelaide assembly fell due, in April, the brethren tried eighteen different halls, all of which pleaded patriotism as an excuse for not having Jehovah’s witnesses. Finally, the Caledonian Hall was booked, but next day this, too, was canceled. A writ was issued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for breach of contract and an injunction granted compelling the Caledonian Society to honor their contract for the hall. However, they chose to ignore the Supreme Court order. On the Sunday evening, the speaker stood on a chair in front of the hall, and spoke for fifteen minutes to an attentive audience of 500 persons. He pointed out that while the Caledonians justify themselves by making an issue of the National Anthem, their motto is, “God save the king, but down with his courts.” The crowd appreciated this, and followed round the corner to Kingdom Hall, where they heard the advertised address in comfort. The Supreme Court case is still pending, but now the brethren have had a major success, in that one of Adelaide’s leading theaters has opened its doors for a public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other state capitals, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, all had their turn in these assemblies. And a royal blessing from Jehovah they proved to be! Three of the assemblies recorded an all-time record attendance for the state, the good-will interest rolling in by the hundreds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Australian people spend a great amount of time in the open air, and, to be sure, the public meetings follow them there! Each Sunday, summer and winter the one-hour discourses have been presented at Sydney Domain, with audiences ranging up to the 200 mark. Lunch-hour talks are also featured around Sydney’s parks, with similar attendances. Publishers from many parts of Australia report that they have met people who first became interested through these open-air programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pioneer Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers, special and general alike, have been deeply grateful for the Lord’s provision as set out in your letter of June 18. One sister, 47 years in the pioneer work, writes her appreciation and says, “It is remarkable how the great Jehovah provides and cares for us. One could write a book with incidents of his care under almost impossible situations.” In this scattered territory, the sacrifices are often great, but the ‘same God over all’ is always present to strengthen his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneers have greatly improved their hour and back-call averages during the year. Hours have increased from 166.0 to 176.6. New companies have been started, and weak companies have been better organized. A number of opposition towns have yielded to the patient, kindly example of the pioneers, and small companies are now flourishing in them. In one town special pioneers had two studies with a person who had gone there for a fortnight’s holiday. She enjoyed the studies so much that she stopped several more weeks. Now she is a regular publisher, and plans to travel to the Sydney Assembly to be baptized and go into the pioneer work herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Salute Issue Decided</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The four-year-old Victorian flag salute issue was successfully closed in February. The authorities permitted the children to go back to school provided they repeated the words of a declaration each Monday morning. This declaration is similar to that in the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State. </span><span class="font4">Difficulty over the flag salute is now practically unknown. Some masters who previously consented to this persecution now find that Jehovah’s witnesses are among their best pupils. One headmaster has gone out of his way to aid the children in their after-school and vacation-pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the summer, there was an enrollment of 21 vacation pioneers. A 14-year-old youngster, the local “church” organist, went straight from “church” to the vacationpioneer ranks. His parson made determined efforts to win him back, but without avail, and he now conducts a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book study among his former Sunday-school associates. Two other pioneers, aged 9 and 13 years, witnessed In a military hospital (out-of-bounds to adult publishers), placing 50 books and 150 booklets in three days. The young Australian publishers are truly ‘remembering their Creator’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The government and the military authorities have now paid compensation for the seizure and occupancy of properties during the ban. This has been given wide publicity in the press and radio, thus helping to break down the prejudices that some people still hold. The Society’s premises at 7 Beresford Road, Strathfield, have now been restored to first-class condition, and the office Is again located in the main building.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The publishers everywhere are showing a splendid spirit of fellowship. One and all have been greatly encouraged by the thrilling news from the Cleveland Assembly, and are now looking forward keenly to our own united assembly in December, and to the arrival of our brethren from Gilead. This direct link with headquarters will mean so much both to the Assembly and to the Theocratic organization of the work throughout the land. It Is also a source of joy that Australia is represented in the eighth class at Gilead. We look forward keenly to the day when you yourself will come to this “land down under”, and so we will feel that we are tied in in every way with the Lord’s organization, as it extends to the farthermost corners of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>EXPANSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is a tremendous territory in the South Sea islands. Millions upon millions of people, speaking different languages, inhabit the thousands of islands just north of Australia. This vast territory needs workers. It is hoped that some day we shall be able to get Gilead graduates into this territory too, there to make glad the nations with His people. Before the war there were a number of publishers working in this territory, and it is good now to hear from some of these publishers once again. The Australian office makes a report of what is being done in some of the territories still under its jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font4">For five years, the Fijian government had denied the brethren the privilege of importing the latest food from the Lord’s storehouse. However, as a result of representations In August, 1945, the Colonial secretary relaxed the ban “to the extent of permitting the Importation of such publications as may be approved by the Governor in Council”. Shipments of all the latest literature have now been admitted to Fiji, and the Kingdom publishers are rejoicing in their privileges of studying and distributing it Moreover, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font4"> are now being prepared in Fijian. The company at Suva, 11 publishers strong, put in 325 hours during the year, distributing 36 books, 438 booklets and 95 magazines, and making 55 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keen interest in the truth is already appearing in many quarters. Recently a publisher met a young Fijian teacher, who is also a student at a local religious institution. He had already been impressed by a study of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> and gladly contributed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”. </span><span class="font4">The book quickly made the rounds of his fellow students, and in due course the religious principal took him to task. Calling his fellow students together, the young Fijian said: “You have all read at least portions of this book; tell me, is it, as the teacher says, a bad book?” They unanimously replied, “It is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">very good</span><span class="font4"> book.” There is plenty of room for pioneers to assist in spreading these very good books to tlie meek, teachable people of Fiji, and we pray that the Lord may soon send more workers into this corner of the vineyard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">While September, 1945, ushered in the postwar “peace” in most countries, it brought wars and internal strife to Java and Sumatra. In place of the Japanese occupation, the brethren now had to contend with the uprising of the Indonesians against the Dutch. The Japanese had regarded all neutrals as their enemies, and had sent most of the Kingdom publishers to prison. This brought many hardships—“four years’ starvation” one brother termed it. Three brethren died in prison. Now, the survivors have to face the turmoil that has accompanied the Indonesian revolt. Gangs of armed youths roam the streets, and Europeans are “sniped at” on sight A twelve-year-old boy was kidnaped out of a home in which some of the brethren were staying, and has not been seen again. White brethren have either evacuated from the islands or have been held in concentration camps for their protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in 1946, the Javanese brethren again made contact with the Australian Branch, after four years’ isolation. They are now receiving </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other literature, and have re-commenced regular studies. In the capital, Batavia, ten brothers and sisters are studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in English each Sunday, while a Malay study is held in another part of the town. They are translating </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> into Malay. The local disturbances have made organized witnessing difficult, and hence we have no field service reports; but we are assured that the brethren are talking the Kingdom at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have some thrilling accounts of integrity-keeping during the Japanese occupation. One brother who resolutely refused war work was tapped on the head with a hammer for two hours until unconscious. They then filled him up with water, and jumped on his stomach. Another brother who insisted on talking the Kingdom was imprisoned in a dirty hole for seven weeks, without bath, shave or change of clothes, and was so severely beaten with a club that the bruises lasted six weeks. When others were arrested for declining the Shinto ceremonies of saluting the flag and bowing towards Tokyo, a “Christian” clergyman was brought into court to persuade the brethren that the Japanese emperor and government were the “higher powers”. He failed miserably, as did all Japanese efforts at coercion of the Lord’s servants. Although the difficulties continue a short time longer in Java, the Kingdom publishers are keenly looking forward to Theocratic expansion in that small island of 40,000,000 souls.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>SIAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Siamese brethren pushed on valiantly with the work during the war years. Many studies were commenced, and local preachers and others turned from religion to the truth. In September, 1945, the interned Australian brethren were released. About the same time, information began to leak through from brethren In other lands, and, above all, precious issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> were received. The four-year-old famine had broken!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, the brethren received a shipment of literature from the United States, and another shipment from Australia. These were regarded as the main events of the year, and they were quickly followed up by diligent effort in the field. In the one month of August, more than 500 books and 2,000 booklets were distributed from the Bangkok depot. At the same time, the brethren have been eagerly delving into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid,</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> in order to catch up with their fellow publishers in other parts of the earth. The 14 publishers placed 14,183 books and booklets during 1946 service year and started 47 book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the war some of the European brethren have visited the north of Siam, and there they find a great increase. In one small town where only two persons had previously shown interest, a group of sixteen adults and some children are now assembling for study. Tw</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup>o young brethren are inquiring about the pioneer work. The head of another </span><span class="font4">village, who had previously opposed the work, Is now greatly interested and is inviting the townsfolk along to the studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An educated girl of a strongly Buddhist family heard of the truth through some friends, and sent word for someone to call on her. She was deeply Impressed by the studies, saying that she had asked many questions of her friends in the churches, but they could never satisfy her. It is part of the Siamese religion to be friendly to callers, especially foreigners, and hence literature placements are usually good. The step that requires hard work is to have the people get down to regular study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Word is now received that the British authorities have granted the German pioneer brethren permission to stop in the country. All the Siamese brethren were very joyful that Brother Powell was able to represent their country at the Glad Nations Assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren incarcerated in Changte Prison, Singapore, during the Japanese occupation, were able to hold studies three times a week, with an attendance of five or six. One of the sisters died in prison. Singapore is still in a chaotic condition, but the brethren are receiving the spiritual food, and enjoying it. A brother in Singapore has rendered invaluable aid in re-consigning shipments from Australia to some surrounding countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">After years of terror and frightful experiences Jehovah’s witnesses once more come forward in the country of Austria. They have been delivered from the oppressor, the dictatorial power which inflicted very heavy burdens upon every individual standing for the truth. The war, of course, was a hindrance to the preaching of the gospel; but, despite all the trials that befell our brethren, they still carried on peacefully preaching the good news as they had opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the war there were 549 publishers in Austria ; and today there are 730 preaching the gospel, having devoted 34,600 hours to field service during the year. Many were thrown into prison and, according to reports, 48 brethren were executed for taking their stand on the side of the Kingdom as against Hitler rule. Many others languished in jail and died there. During these terrible years of horror they had in mind Psalm 5:11, Am. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.:</span><span class="font5"> “But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.” Jehovah has brought them forth, and throughout all of Austria they stand in the power of Jehovah as light-bearers of the truth and are making glad this nation with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After ten years of spiritual starvation the people of the land are eager to receive the good news, and they seize the literature with joy and appreciation. The publishers are grateful for organization instructions and are following the new method of preaching, making back-calls and conducting book studies. During the year 16,700 back-calls were made, and at the close of the year they were conducting 360 book studies weekly. It makes our hearts glad to see the faithfulness of our Austrian brethren; and it is our desire to support them in every manner, not only with material things and spiritual provisions, but also by doing our own work in preaching the gospel among our own people. Thus the banner of the Lord will be held high world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant in Austria has a real task to perform in advancing the Kingdom interests there. Excerpts from his annual report will be of great interest to all readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the fact that entrance into the houses was debarred in Vienna, and that they were without electric current for three to four months after the occupation, and despite the absence of every means of transport, we assembled ourselves together to give praise and thanks to the Giver of eternal salvation. Many tears of gratitude flowed unrestrainedly down the cheeks of those till then oppressed ones. The throb of new life pulsating in those who had remained at home became stronger with the return of each homecomer out of the crucible, who, with powerful conviction and fired with hope, supported and animated them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase of the Kingdom interests is inspiring; everywhere the companies are adjusting themselves to Theocratic principles and education. We had lost all our means of proclamation through the raging of the Nazi terror; now on our return we began to prepare copies of articles from back numbers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on the typewriter. Only when we could procure a duplicating machine could we begin to appease to some extent the persisting hunger of the brethren. Four thousand booklets, together with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> songs, and numerous other pamphlets, could be prepared in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any day now we are expecting a second consignment from Switzerland, this time 80,000 booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> and, on the occasion of a conference with our Swiss brothers arranged recently at an Austrian border town, we were told that we might expect a third consignment of literature shortly. All these things have rejoiced our hearts greatly and now we shall be able to fortify the Austrian brethren and friends of the truth in their increased service from house to house. The echo which is reaching us from among the publishers resounds with joy and gratitude, and we are firmly convinced that our next annual report will show greater strides In the proclamation work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Allied military authorities are kindly disposed, correct and courteous towards our activity. The highest officers of the military government are exemplary in their attitude and service on our behalf. The work has been promoted by the civility of these men, who would like to see the publications of the Watch Tower Society sweep the spiritual refuse out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the rural districts the brethren shun no hardship in giving the witness. With the zeal of the Lord’s house, they undertake wearisome journeys by rail; they sacrifice nights of sleep if it means bringing the glorious message to scattered lambs. Each one knows that we are hastening to the final showdown; therefore their zeal. As “fishers” and “hunters” each one wants to prove his faithfulness to the Commander to the Peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The joy and gratitude of the brethren knew no bounds when the big consignment of clothing reached us from America, for the effects of the war have brought about such utter deficiencies in all things used in daily life as have never been experienced before. The brethren were also very glad to receive a consignment of food from Switzerland to the value of 10,000 Swiss francs. In the distribution of these gifts of love many a tear of joyful gratitude was seen to flow. Our prayers ascending to the throne of heavenly grace will be an acknowledgment of the unspeakable gifts with which we have been so richly blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is also worthy of mention that to date we have been able to give two radio broadcasts, one lecture over Radio Salzburg and the second over the Vorarlberg station in Dornbirn. The subject of this lecture was: “Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses in German Concentration Camps.” It is characteristic that a Swiss minister living near the Austrian border, and who listened in to this discourse, should complain to the Salzburg station, because mention was made of the less praiseworthy attitude of the church in the whole political happenings during the Nazi regime. Permission for a third radio broadcast has been granted us by the Vienna Sender.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The war years have left their mark on Belgium and the Belgian people. The Catholic Hierarchy supported the Nazi invader, and the peace-loving people of Belgium really see how their religion failed them in the time of need. During the past year the people of goodwill have been made glad with Jehovah’s people in this country. All through the war years the faithful publishers of The Theocracy talked with the people of Belgium about Jehovah’s new world of righteousness. The enemy could not stop them. Because of their faithfulness under stress and opposition, many people of good-will were found and have taken their stand on Jehovah’s side. In 1939 there were 150 publishers reporting field service in Belgium. Today there is an average of 804 publishers, with a peak of 902 during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren, who are now organized in companies, are grateful to be in communication again with the head office, and are thankful to the Lord for organization instructions, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and for the privilege of taking this publication into the streets. Again they are coming together in assemblies, and in October there were 1,600 in attendance at an assembly. Many of the Belgians have had their fill of religion, and now they are turning from the falsehoods of the Hierarchy and singing praises to Jehovah. The brethren worked peacefully through the years of war, and Jehovah has rewarded their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society sent a brother who graduated from Gilead, a former servant to the brethren in the United States, to Belgium to assist in the work. He is now acting as Branch servant and working with the faithful Branch office staff. His report on the progress of the work is very encouraging, and a few excerpts are published below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the occupation the Branch office was cut off from the headquarters at Brooklyn, and so naturally there were many Theocratic instructions which were not received here during that time. Hence, although the publishers had increased wonderfully during this time, at the end of the war there was a great need for proper Theocratic organization here. As the Israelites of old realized the necessity of being unified and having one central command under Jephthah to combat the totalitarian Ammonites, so Jehovah’s witnesses in Belgium today realize the importance of placing themselves under the command of the Greater Jephthah and his Theocratic Society. The visit of you and Brother Henschel last December was the first real step toward getting things properly organized, and since then we have made good progress. This visit was a particularly outstanding event for the brethren in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purchase by the Society of a building for the Branch office and Bethel home at your direction has been another thing that has contributed very greatly toward the advancement of the work in this country. We are now well established In the new office and home, and we find that we can accomplish much more work than before. Some members of the family say that their health has improved due to the fact that the conditions under which they work and live are so greatly improved. The brethren in Belgium are very grateful for this and wish to express their appreciation to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The shipments of used clothing from our brethren in America during February and March were a great help to the publishers, especially the pioneers. We were able to outfit each pioneer completely who was in the pioneer service at that time. All together, 1,431 different individuals and 73 more families were helped with used clothing in Belgium and Luxembourg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you were here you made arrangements to start the special pioneer work In this country. Accordingly, this work was organized in March. Four brethren who have spent many years in the pioneer service in Belgium were chosen for this service. Three of them have been sent to the ancient city of Brugge, a city of about 50,000 inhabitants which is noted the world over for its ancient cathedrals and churches and is naturally steeped in religion and tradition. At one time there was a publisher who reported irregularly at Brugge, but apart from this we have no record of any Kingdom publishers ever reporting from this city. Now, after six months of special pioneer activity there are five publishers of The Theocracy in this stronghold of religion and about 15 attending the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study. Another special pioneer was sent to Arion, a stronghold of the Jesuits, and as a result of his activity there are now three publishers reporting from this town and about 10 who attend the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the service year we had 19 pioneers; now we have 58. During the year many of the pioneers have spread out into the isolated regions, particularly in the Ardennes, and as a result many people who have not been visited by Jehovah’s witnesses for a long time, if ever, have received the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This work was inaugurated for the first time in Belgium this summer. The young Belgian publishers responded well to the call and 28 have engaged In full-time service during their vacations. Many of them have placed more than the older pioneers, and they have averaged 159.8 hours for the month of August, which is well above the average for the general pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have been able to receive supplies of literature quite regularly during the year, but it has been like showers of rain after a long dry spell, and the publishers and people of good-will are constantly asking for more literature. The latest bound book of the Society that has been translated into Hoilandish and French is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> Naturally the publishers are getting anxious for some of the later books in their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Jehovah’s witnesses never miss an opportunity to make known the good news of the Kingdom, one usually finds some of the publishers at the market places of most of the principal cities and towns of Belgium, especially on Sunday morning. Usually the publishers have a table with a display of literature on it, and different brothers take turns in giving short talks to the public. In this way much literature is placed and many persons of good-will are found. The publishers have many interesting experiences in the market places. Recently after a brother had given a short talk a man came out of the crowd and said, “At last I have found you. I have been looking for Jehovah’s witnesses ever since I got out of the concentration camp.” Another time at the market in this same city a priest attempted to speak out against the witnesses, but someone put his hand over the priest’s mouth and said, “You have preached a long time in your church; now let these people preach a while.” The priest Immediately left the scene.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There has been very little open opposition to the publication of the message here during the year. Probably the religionists know that the people are too well acquainted with their collaborative activities during the Nazi occupation, and for this reason are afraid to oppose the witnesses. We know that Satan’s postwar “new order” has no love for us; however, we do not put our trust in this makeshift of man, but in the everlasting Theocracy of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This territory comes under the direction of the Belgian office and is another country that was overrun by war. It is interesting to know that the literature cannot be placed with the people when the publisher goes from door to door. He may only offer the Bible and then arrange for back-calls. The report of the 30 publishers in Luxembourg shows that they are doing marvelous work in the back-call activity, making 3,030 back-calls during the year. These 30 publishers have averaged 35 book studies weekly. Even though they are not able to place literature directly with the people, they did place in the homes of interested parties 2,802 books and booklets. There are three companies in Luxembourg, and a peak of 39 publishers was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant of Belgium, who has visited the brethren in Luxembourg, writes the following in his year report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The companies in this country being under the direction of the Belgian office, the servant to the brethren and I visited them during the month of May. It was the first time that a representative of the Society had visited them since before the war. We found the publishers faithfully working the same as their brethren throughout the world, which is strong proof that Jehovah’s people are directed by his active force and not by a man. For if the latter were true then these publishers of The Theocracy in Luxembourg would have ceased their efforts when they were cut off from the headquarters of the visible organization of the Lord by the totalitarian invaders. As a result of their faithful activity many persons of good-will have been made glad with his people in that land also. The report shows that there has been a steady increase in number of publishers and activity over the last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers in Belgium and Luxembourg rejoice with their fellow publishers throughout the world in the marvelous privileges of service which have been accorded us by our gracious Father in heaven. We have already received much good news from the “Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly” at Cleveland this year, and we are happy at the prospect of enlarging our privileges of service in the great work ahead of us, realizing that there is much to be done in our part of the great harvest field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers in this land have had their difficulties during the past year or two. The dictatorial form of government in power during the previous year no longer recognized the Society as an organization to carry on its work in Brazil. Much effort has been spent by the brethren in trying to have the Society registered with the government. While the Branch office has not been successful yet in this matter, the publishers have moved ahead preaching the gospel, because this is the only thing they can do if they would keep covenant with God. So the work had progressed very well in Brazil during the service year 1946. More publishers are in the field now than at any time heretofore. As the report will show, there is an average of 442 ministers of the gospel working regularly; and a peak of 612 was reached during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the Lord’s grace, the Society was able to send some graduates of the Watchtower Bible School to Brazil during the year, and the Brazilians are appreciative of the work they are doing and the instructions they give in organization. It was the good pleasure of the Society to have the Branch servant and his wife attend the Glad Nations Assembly. During their absence the work moved right ahead steadily, and the report that comes in from the temporary Branch servant points out some interesting happenings in the country during the year. Excerpts from his report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Servant to the brethren visits were begun in Brazil during the year, and this activity has had a stimulating effect upon the service. Theocratic school organizations were begun in Brazil, 42 publishers enrolling in Rio de Janeiro and 45 In Silo Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In March two more graduates of Gilead arrived. They had waited patiently for three years to come to their assignment In Brazil. At the time of their arrival, Brother and Sister Yuille, the Branch servant and his wife, were leaving for the United States in response to Brother Knorr’s gracious invitation to attend the Glad Nations Assembly, However, just before their departure Brazil enjoyed a splendid and moving Memorial assembly with a peak attendance of over 1,000 in all Brazil, only 87 partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The end of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign was heralded with great joy, as it brought an Influx of 2,349 subscriptions, passing the 1,500 quota for Brazil. The petition that had been circulated throughout the land was also filed with the president of Brazil, asking for the granting of legal rights to Jehovah’s witnesses in the land. There were 44,411 names presented to the officials. Never in the history of Brazil had they seen so many signatures offered in a petition. We await action on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A shipment of 250,000 of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span><span class="font4"> booklet was received in Brazil, to be used in a May campaign. Consignments were made to all companies and pioneers throughout Brazil. The quota set for the country was 100,000 copies. S2o Paulo’s consignment was exhausted before the middle of the month passed, and they ordered another 20,000. An excellent distribution was made, and this campaign aroused much interest in the larger cities of Brazil. The campaign brought forth marvelous results. The highest peak of publishers ever reached in Brazil was attained during this month, namely, 612. The report on booklets distributed went up to 116,000. New peaks were reached in book studies and hours in the field, and the work generally has taken on a new spirit, for the publishers are anxious to make glad the nations with his people. Jehovah richly blessed our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came June, with the arrival of more Gilead graduates and the catching up on the work that was getting behind because of more publishers, more shipments, more printing, and more subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of the year the Brazilian Branch office announced to all the publishers in Brazil that they too were going to have a Glad Nations Assembly In October. We were far away from the Glad Nations Assembly in Cleveland, but we did not need a direct wire or telegraph. No, for we had </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger!</span><span class="font4"> Without fail, two days after each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font4"> release a copy arrived in the Bethel office. This absolutely appeared as a miracle in our eyes in view of the air mail’s requiring 5 to 6 days at least to reach us. The way we daily watched our information board on which was posted the Cleveland convention program one would think that we were the ones who were going to attend the next sessions. It was like having a spiritual ringside seat at the Stadium to receive this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger.</span><span class="font4"> The American brethren, along with their Portuguese-speaking brethren in the office, would get together on the arrival of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span><span class="font4"> The American brethren would translate the whole thing for the family. As a result the family has been fired with enthusiasm to work as never before, and especially in their preparation for our own Glad Nations Assembly in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With grateful hearts for the blessed privileges enjoyed during this past year of joyful service, and with new determination and zeal to stand fearless against the coming world conspiracy, we face 1947 with great expectation and gladness of heart. Soon Brother and Sister Yuille will be back, after a long absence, bringing with them the first Gilead-trained Brazilian, as well as other Gilead graduates. The vast territory of Brazil might easily contain all the brethren who have graduated from Gilead thus far, but we do not fret for lack of help. Jehovah can make ‘one to become a thousand’ and flood this country and all the earth with his message and his people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">His truth is globe-girdling and all nations will be forced to the admission that Jehovah is doing great things for his glad people everywhere. He has done wonders for us here in Brazil and we are awake to his rousing call to fearlessness, well knowing that the Theocratic “Immanuel” Government shall prevail, for “God is with us”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The year 1946 is a marked year for the Lord’s people in this South American country. Many were the victories gained by Jehovah’s faithful servants in this little but not-forgotten land by Jehovah. The service year 1945 ended with the work still hindered and paralyzed by government action. The partial ban on the importation of Watchtower publications had been in force since 1941, and a complete ban had been imposed in June 1944. Now that the war for Four Freedoms had ended, Jehovah’s witnesses were still denied freedom and liberty to worship God by using Bible helps, even being refused permission to import the King James Version Bible as printed by the Society. However, the brethren were not discouraged; not in the least. Without literature they went forward preaching the gospel. They had hope that someday many more of the people of that nation would be praising Jehovah. So they kept right at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year 1946 was embarked upon by the publishers with great desire to open up the work. The following is what the new Branch servant, a Gilead graduate, has to report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Would 1946 bring new hope and comfort to the local publishers? We needed the removal of this octopus-like ban. We would welcome a visit by the world-traveling president of the Watchtower Society. Would he stop at this small colony on his South American tour? Further, we longed for some instruction and personal help from Gilead graduates permanently stationed here. Would we realize any of these expectations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First, the ban must go. So the Lord’s people prayerfully started to act. An appeal goes to the secretary of state for the Colonies, in London. Like his predecessor in office he declines to intervene, despite the fact that he is a member of the new Labor party. Another of a long line of letters goes to the local government. Comes the reply, it “will not act”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So a public petition is prepared, emphasizing the banning of the Bible! Paid advertisements and letters to the editors are published in the newspapers, keeping the matter before the public. Did they respond? 31,370 names were attached to this petition, filed on March 12. A leaflet entitled “The Holy Bible Banned in British Guiana 1 31,000 Persons Sign Petition to the Governor” informed an Increasingly-alarmed and curious populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">April 5 finds Brother Knorr landing by plane on the shores of British Guiana. He gives a discourse to the brethren that evening. Next morning, the Interview with the Colonial secretary. Not much encouragement is given, as evidenced by this man’s remark concerning Martin Luther: “If he were in this colony today he would have to be restrained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But Jehovah’s witnesses continue, undiscouraged by such men and their organizations. A public lecture, “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” was delivered by Brother Knorr to 650 persons in the Town Hall, Georgetown, April 6. On Sunday morning he gave an Inspiring two-hour account of his European trip. His departure by plane to Trinidad came too soon, but the brethren waving good-bye on the ramp at the edge of the Demarara river were assured that he would return at an early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Spurred on by his thrilling three-day visit, and now aided by a new full-time Gilead graduate, Kingdom work took an upward trend. The ban was discussed on the streets and referred to in a series of public lectures now carried on. A letter to the editor, urging prompt action! Another letter to the government on the lifting of the ban in Nigeria I In a short time the government printed an Extraordinary Gazette: the ban is off! It happened on June 12, 1946 —nearly two years to a day from the complete restriction of all literature June 29, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eager publishers opened 130 dusty cartons of books, booklets and Bibles recovered from the government warehouse. Only a small number were damaged. 240 usable Bibles disappeared from the witnesses’ hands when they had gone but a few steps from Kingdom Hall. The old books, from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font4"> to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> were as new publications to the people and these were being spread at a rapid rate when the more recent literature arrived the following month. Placements from June 15 to August 30 were as follows: 4,194 books and 7,604 booklets, by an average of less than 70 publishers! When street work was begun in August for the first time in British Guiana, magazines were placed almost as quickly as local newspapers are sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now, as if not enough blessings were poured out upon us this year, we receive word that four more Gilead graduates are on their way to us! Also we have scheduled for October 4-6 an assembly that will make up for our absence at Cleveland. Truly we are satisfied that Jehovah has done much for us!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The publishers of British Guiana may be few in number and poor in this world’s goods, but we are privileged by the Lord’s grace to share in this wide witness now reaching its climax. In a colony predominantly colored and generally overlooked by its British rulers, we have not been overlooked by Jehovah God or by his visible organization. We have been favored with the much-needed visit by Brother Knorr, helped from Gilead Bible School, and aided by the removal of the ban. We do not want the ‘stones to cry out’, but we ourselves joyfully respond to the blessed invitation to preach the message of the Kingdom to all who will hear, that those of “all nations” may be glad with His people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain and Ireland have had some wonderful privileges during the year just past. They have earnestly put forth every effort to make glad the nations of these islands with His people. Some have responded. After many years of war, accompanied by shortages of food and supplies for comfortable living, we find a splendid increase in the number of publishers compared with that at the beginning of the war, but a decrease as compared with the previous year. The pressures brought upon the British people may have discouraged some to distraction ; others may have become weary in well-doing. It is necessary for the Christian to keep in mind that the Devil is a wily foe and will try to deflect everyone he can from serving Jehovah. Those who continue on with the doing of Jehovah’s will rejoice in the bountiful blessings being poured upon them. They appreciate the organization that has been formed by the Lord in the earth, and the faithful will push ahead. No matter where one works in the earth it is certain that opposition will arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several members of the Bethel family, including the Branch servant, and a good delegation of British brethren, left Britain at the close of the year to attend the Glad Nations Assembly. The report of the acting Branch servant takes in all the important happenings of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding In all the experiences the year brought us was the visit of the president to these shores. This brought a personal link between the headquarters of the Lord’s visible organization and ourselves which we had not had for several years. It was long awaited and eagerly anticipated and it brought much joy to the brethren throughout the British Isles. It gave us much valued help in organization for the furtherance of the work here. After the long grueling war years it was reviving to one’s spirit to be able to discuss the joys and problems of the field at firsthand. Assemblies were arranged at Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Sheffield, Lincoln, Bradford, Stockport and London. At all these, Brother Knorr was able to address the brethren and people of good-will and much joy was experienced by all. After the pleasurable excitement of the assemblies (already reported in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower)</span><span class="font4"> it was evident to all that the task assigned to God’s people is not to be held up by this world’s adverse conditions; but, as Ezekiel saw it in vision, the organization and Its work moves on chariot-like, swiftly, under God’s irresistible spirit. For this clear vision and the accompanying blessings, we give thanks to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prominent in all our field-service activities for the year was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign. This was staged for the four months January to April. All appreciated the privilege of engaging in such a campaign after the restrictions that the government ban placed upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for nearly four years. Readily the publishers responded to the call and a splendid effort was put forth. A quota of 30,000 new subscriptions was set for the country, this being more than had ever been attained for any previous campaign. As the weeks rolled by, the enthusiasm grew and it became evident that we were going to exceed our quota, but we hardly expected to reach the grand total of 50,130 for the campaign period. This total of new subscriptions has made the publishers realize how much really can be done with the proper outlook and the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscription lists have now greatly increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are grateful for the increased supplies of literature from Brooklyn. This has enabled the publishers to make a fuller use of their privileges in the field. The literature placements have Increased considerably. The past year shows a larger output of literature than we have had for some years, the actual increase over the previous year being 784,268 books and booklets. It is a pleasure to be able to use the beautiful books coming from the Brooklyn factory after handling the paper-covered books that we had to have printed over here during the war period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers and companies have entered Into this work with enthusiasm during the year. The grand total of 10,349 public meetings held, together with the extensive advertising of the meetings, has done much to awaken interest and pave the way for book studies in the homes. The new titles to the talks proved attractive and stimulated the publishers to new activity. There has been some difficulty in obtaining halls, but this has not deterred the brethren unduly. In all such cases they have sought out suitable stands in the public parks, village greens, and anywhere else where the people could be gathered together. Many interesting experiences have been reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In keeping with the expansion in all parts of the earth, arrangements were made early in the year for pioneers to be moved out from the towns already being worked by companies, into the isolated areas, which had been inaccessible during the war period, being prohibited areas. This includes the islands off the north of Scotland and the coastal districts. Pioneers are now in the Shetland and Orkney Isles, as well as the Outer Hebrides. Good results have been reported in this territory, which for some years has not had the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We now have 42 pioneers working in Ireland, of which 20 are in the south among the Catholic people of Eire. They are located in the larger towns, such as Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny, Dunkaid and Limerick. The reports coming in from the pioneers tell of bitter opposition from the priests. The people of Eire are kindly and hospitable, but when aroused by the priests there are no limits to which they will not go in dealing with “heretics”. The favorite practice of these priests is to label Jehovah’s witnesses as “Communist devils”. However, the faithful pioneers in Eire are carrying on despite the opposition. Only those who have worked in Eire can appreciate the extreme poverty and priest-ridden condition of the people. Truly the pope has described it as “one of the brightest jewels of my crown”. The country contains numerous “priest hatcheries” where they turn out priests for other lands. In fact, the chief industry seems to be that of exporting priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is encouraging to note the good progress the Lord has given us in this land covering the period of the war years. In 1939 when World War II commenced, the publishers reporting were 6,800, but now we have reached a peak of 12,884. This shows an increase of nearly 100 percent. The back-calls increased over the same period from 176,000 to the grand total of 1,258,334 in 1946. The book studies are an additional feature of our field service and these are proving a very ready help to the seekers after the truth, enabling them to gain the needed knowledge quickly so that they can take their stand with the Lord’s people. In 1939 the attendance at the Memorial celebration was 8,438, whereas in 1946 the attendance was 18,816. This all testifies to the faithful labors of Jehovah’s servants in this land In reaching out the helping hand to the truth-hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time the false shepherds cry out in their distress when someone in their flock leaves them to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. Up and down the country there has been much wailing on the part of the clergy. One of the publications recently stated, among other things, “They (Jehovah’s witnesses) are a challenge to Christians because they know the Bible far better than most Christians know it.” It is very evident that the Church of England clergy have lost faith completely in the Bible. From time to time they openly state that they cannot accept what is written therein. All this Is opening the eyes of the honest-hearted ones and they are turning away from organized religion. There is certainly a field ripe for harvest here among the forty-odd million people to whom we have the privilege of taking the Kingdom message. The brethren have been advised to ignore all these scurrilous attacks from the clergy and push on with their work. It appears to be a waste of time to give any attention to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of the year, the invitation extended to brothers from the British field to attend the course at Gilead School gave cause for rejoicing. We in this land feel that this provides a closer link with all that the Society has arranged for the well-being of the work and its expansion in all the earth. We rejoice that some have proved themselves in the field and that they have this further privilege. We sincerely hope that the 24 students now at Gilead from this country will be more fully equipped for their future assignments. We are confident that the sixmonth course at Gilead will be a blessing to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as advice of the Cleveland Convention was received here there was quite a stir among the brethren as to the possibilities of their attending. We advised the companies of the cost of travel and other details that were necessary and it was indeed gratifying to find that, together with the students and those invited from London Bethel, there were about 100 who attended the convention at Cleveland from Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren who attended have been thrilled by all they have seen and heard. It has done much to enthuse them to fuller service in the days ahead. We take this opportunity to thank you all at the Brooklyn office for all the help rendered in making the journey possible. There have been many expressions of appreciation for all the assistance given by the American brethren to the travelers from this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The newsreels shown in the cinemas here during the week following Cleveland convention showed excerpts of shots of the great immersion service and the trailer camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrangements made for some of us from the British Bethel to spend time at headquarters at Brooklyn; to share in the activities in the factory, office and home, and to gain valued instruction, is another blessing which cannot be measured fully yet, but which we hope will reflect itself in the organization In the British field, and particularly in the efficient organization of the office and home here. We are grateful for all the evidence of Jehovah’s direction and blessing on his organization. It is clear that there is much work for his people to do, and in order that this may be done with speed and efficiency, provision is made for expansion to meet this need. The visit to headquarters, Gilead and Cleveland convention has widened our vision of the organization and the magnitude of the work and we give praise to Jehovah for all these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prospects before us are indeed good. With the information we now have of the plans for the immediate future, we will look with keen anticipation to the re-organlz-ing of the companies under the new arrangements which will be put into operation as soon as we have the details. Also, we will begin to make preparations for the greatest convention ever in this land when you visit us next year. Be assured that the brethren here will give a warm welcome to any that come here from America. We anticipate that some will come over and share with us in the blessings of the 1947 convention in Britain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, we desire to express our thankfulness to Jehovah for all his boundless love and mercy toward us. We have received much that spurs us on in the doing of his will. To be privileged to walk in the light of truth which shines ever brighter and clearer as the days go by is surely good reason why we should make full use of the privileges of service offered to us. The never-failing rich supply of spiritual food has sustained us and we know it will continue to sustain us as we fight on under our Commander and Leader, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This British possession has not done much for the education of the people; and as far as an understanding of the Bible is concerned, religionists have kept the inhabitants of the land pretty well in darkness. The people are very superstitious, but some of this is being broken down now by reason of the educational work carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses. Two graduates of the Watchtower Bible School have been sent to British Honduras to assist the few brethren there in getting better organized to help the people understand God’s Word. It is not too difficult to reach the people in Belize, but persons living in small towns and villages outside the principal city are often isolated because of poor roads. Other towns and villages in the country can be reached only by boat service on the navigable rivers and streams or along the seashore. The brethren are planning to get to all of this territory in time, so that all will be given an opportunity to be glad with Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Branch was established during the year for the convenience of the work in that country, and the servant appointed makes this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a general rule, the people are very friendly and nice to witness to. Very seldom does one call at a home and not get to give at least an oral witness, and in many cases leave some literature. Many more would take bound books if it were not for the fact that they have very little money. Conditions for the common man, the laborer, are very bad, most of them having barely enough to buy bread, rice and fish, which are the foods eaten mostly by the natives. Quite often when walking along the streets we hear someone calling us, or will meet someone who wants “one of them books”. On several occasions they have come to our home asking for a book or Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meetings have had fairly good results. It was quite some time before they could be arranged for after the arrival of the missionaries, due to some illness and other obstacles; but since they have been carried on good results have followed. The first one of these was attended by 46 persons, the peak attendance being 58, and 102 at the semipublie meeting held when the president, Brother Knorr, and Brother Franz paid us a visit in May. Some book studies have resulted from these meetings, and others make very favorable comments thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no doubt that the high light of the service year in British Honduras was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Franz. The local brethren very much appreciated this visit, especially since this was the first time a president of the Society had ever visited British Honduras. They have expressed the hope that it will not be the last either. You can also be assured the Gilead missionaries here are looking forward to the next visit of the president.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In harmony with the hope for more publishers, and also with the great expansion work going on now all over the earth, we are looking forward to new quarters for the local meetings, our quarters having grown too small already.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are nearly a million people scattered around on the different islands that come under the Branch office at Port of Spain. Through this newly-established office the work is directed on all the islands under its jurisdiction. The principal island of the British West Indies territory is Trinidad. At the beginning of the year there was still an official ban on the work. The brethren, however, continued to witness the best they knew how. In November the ban was lifted, and the brethren rejoiced and went forward with great zeal. Immediately the work began to gather impetus as others, observing the great things done by Jehovah for his people, joined in and invited still others to be glad with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A graduate of Gilead was sent to Port of Spain to assist the Branch servant there in the organizing of the work. His report shows a splendid increase of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">activity in these islands. It is hoped that more brethren from Gilead will soon join the native publishers to give them further instruction, and especially to comfort the people of good-will. The servant’s report of conditions on all of these islands follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A blessing of great gladness was the visit for the first time of a president of the Society to the British West Indies. When It was learned that you and the vice-president were to be with us the last w'eek in March, we rejoiced. After extensive advertising of the lecture, “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” we were rewarded with the theater filled with 1,611 persons. Over 200 engaged in field service; 39 were immersed. A complete report of the convention appeared In the June 15, 1946, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Additional blessings for the brethren were the enlarging of the Branch to include the other islands of the British in this area, a new Branch home and oliice, and more help from Gilead graduates arranged for in Port of Spain and some of the other islands. Their arrival is confidently expected to result in better organization and greater activity in feeding the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the year there were 16 companies in the area now within the jurisdiction of the Branch. The number of publishers reporting was 247, witli an additional 7 engaged as pioneers. These increased until a peak was readied in May of 527, including 26 pioneers and 3 specials from Gilead. At the close of the year 25 companies were enrolled on the Society’s records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time eight of the islands have organized companies functioning on them. These are Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Vincent, Tobago, and Trinidad. The company that was functioning on St. Kitts has become disorganized. The remaining brethren there as well as on St. Vincent have asked that Gilead graduates or special pioneers be sent to their assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three Gilead brothers who were sent to Barbados in November have been a considerable help in getting the brethren properly organized. Previously there had been but two companies, with some 68 publishers. Now there have been six companies organized and which report 127 publishers. The three act as servants to the brethren about twice a year and are thus able to encourage and aid all the companies on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently some ill feeling has developed toward these brothers on the part of two or three who claim they are of the remnant and have been “cold-shouldered”. Charges and countercharges have been made with the result that there is some taking of sides by the Bridgetown company. It is hoped that this condition will soon pass away and all will seek first the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other islands are asking for Gilead graduates to be sent to help them and for someone to come to them as a servant to the brethren. We too hope that this can soon be arranged, that the other islands may be properly organized and the new interest built up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While we started the year out with 17 enrolled as pioneers, the number has grown from a decline of 10 in December to 46 (6 vacation pioneers) at the end of the year. Some of these are making a determined effort to engage in all forms of the service and qualify in two years’ time for an invitation to Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the pioneers apparently have not as yet seen the real purpose of their enrollment and place as many books as possible then move to new territory without properly caring for the interest found. Even so, their back-calls were 7,287, and average book studies for the group, 132. Hours were 32,128 in spite of much rain and much walking. The pioneers have done good work in the public meeting campaign. In addition to aiding the companies and giving lectures at company-sponsored meetings, they have sponsored a number of meetings themselves, totaling 142.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In closing this report, Brother Knorr, we earnestly hope that you will be able to again visit us in the coming year. Not only is strength and encouragement received from such visits, but we gain necessary counsel and aid in Increasing the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The service year just ended was the first year in six years that the brethren were able to go forward without restrictions imposed by the government. During all these previous years Jehovah’s witnesses peacefully but fearlessly moved forward preaching the gospel. Jehovah rewarded them for their efforts. The door has opened wide in the country of Canada, and an extensive campaign of reconstruction has begun. This is very evident from the service report furnished by the Branch servant. The publishers have carried the glad tidings to the meek throughout the vast land of Canada, and many of that nation are praising Jehovah. A new peak has been reached in the number of publishers, namely, 11,218. So many good things happened to our Canadian brethren in the past year. They again got </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watchtower, Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> books direct from Brooklyn; and they feel, as it were, that the cords binding them have been taken away, for they again have full freedom to preach the gospel. They are making the best of this freedom, too, for they have energetically and earnestly put their hand to the plow. One can feel the joyful note in the report of the Canadian Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The faithful pioneers have enjoyed many precious privileges. Theirs is the real delight of locating so many of the Lord’s “other sheep”, and their joy knows no bounds as they are able to inaugurate regular Bible studies with these humble persons. By reason of diligence in service 44 general pioneers have qualified for invitation into the special pioneer service. From the ranks of the full-time publishers 19 were invited to and graduated from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Now 16 others have left the country for enrollment in the eighth class. Of the graduates from earlier classes it has pleased the Lord to send forth 12 to foreign assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren at the Bethel home have appreciated the privilege of performing service on behalf of their brethren in the field. The staff has been considerably reduced during the year, due to the discontinuation of the printing of books, booklets, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in three languages, all of which are now being forwarded from the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The spirit of Jehovah operating upon his servants has made it possible to accomplish the work done in the printery. Early in the service year we dismantled and moved our machinery from its temporary location in the city to the permanent location in the Branch. With your permission, a power cutter was purchased, which has been a real boon to the work in this department. All of the machinery has been overhauled and painted, which service was voluntarily rendered by local skilled brethren and members of the staff. During the year we printed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in two languages, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Commander to the Peoples”, Kingdom News, Informant,</span><span class="font4"> advertising leaflets, placards, window cards, bookmarks, and office stationery—a grand total of 14,581,089 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the greatest joys experienced during this year was to once again receive from the Brooklyn office large shipments of Kingdom literature in the form of handsome cloth-bound books and attractive and delightful booklets. How we had longed and prayed for the time to come when these precious instruments would flow freely into this, country and thence to the homes of the people! Hailed with delight was the first colored-cover </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> from Brooklyn, and it was a pleasure to display it at the busy Intersections. Large supplies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> entered the country, the first issue being No. 678, of which we distributed 130,000 copies. Quickly followed No. 682, containing material exposing the opposition in Quebec. To us who had been deprived of this literature for so many years it was a great satisfaction to see the stockroom well filled and the shipments going out to the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick there are large sections of territory untouched. Of the 11J million people in this country 3J million reside in these two provinces. It is of vital interest to note that among the 8 million inhabitants in the rest of Canada there are about 10,700 publishers reporting; whereas in these two provinces the total reporting is but 500. Montreal, with its more than a million population, contains the majority of these publishers, namely, about 300. The time has come when the gospel must be preached to those who sit in darkness in these provinces. The French-Canadians are an honest and sincere people and as they have their eyes opened to the truth they do greatly rejoice in singing the glad new song. Much opposition is raised up against our work in these places, but the company publishers and pioneers have implicit trust in Jehovah and go forward fearlessly and without desire to work elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pushed to the limit has been every attempted encroachment on freedom to worship, and the battle has continued with unabated fury in Catholic Quebec. Arrests, court actions, mob violence, are the standard. At the present time 800 charges are pending in Montreal and Verdun alone. The publicity given the Lachine and Chateauguay riots gave the enemy a severe setback. Shortly thereafter a judge of the Quebec Superior court granted seven writs of Prohibition against Montreal and Verdun to restrain the Recorders hearing our cases, and put the trials before a higher court. This certainly created a bombshell in their midst. However, the arrests still continue. So serious has the fight become in these cities that over $100,000 in property bond is now lodged on behalf of the brethren in Montreal alone. This is in addition to more than $2,000 out in cash. There are many of the Lord’s “other sheep” in these provinces, and therefore the work will continue to be even more vigorously advanced than heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other cases have been fought from the lowest to the highest courts in the country. The minister question finally reached the Supreme Court of Canada, where leave was sought to appeal but was refused because there was no financial interest involved. A member of that court said during the argument: “There is no question that a very important question of law arises here. That, however, does not determine the jurisdiction of the court.” Appeal was then made to the Privy Council at London, England. Before the case could be heard there, the military law in Canada was revoked and the authorities dropped the case. In Ontario one faithful special pioneer, accused by a prejudiced minor official of being “not gainfully occupied” and ordered to leave his God-given assignment to take other work, refused, and continued preaching the gospel as commissioned. He was arrested, brought to trial, and the two lower courts found him guilty. The case was fought and won in the Ontario Court of Appeal. One of Canada’s leading weekly newspapers, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night,</span><span class="font4"> commented editorially : “Whatever other objection may be laid against them, the witnesses of Jehovah perform a useful function in almost any<sup>7</sup> society as defenders of the rights and liberties of the common citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the close of the year came the release of the ‘prisoners of the Lord’ from the concentration camps. Repeated efforts had been made for years to effect this release but without success. In June, following your directions, further approaches were made to responsible officials at Ottawa, and the hand of the Lord was discernible In the results. Hitherto-closed doors opened before the approach of the Society’s representatives, and it was possible to come to grips with officials and government representatives, who had thus far been unapproachable. A great shout of praise from overflowing hearts went up when it was announced that the brethren would be released from the camps in time for the Glad Nations Assembly, and furthermore they would now be free to carry on their full-time Theocratic service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">To wind up a year full of joyful Theocratic service, thousands of Canadian brethren made their way from all parts of the country to Cleveland, there to assemble with Jehovah’s anointed and their companions from all parts of the earth. With what delight and thanksgiving all went up to the assembly of Jehovah’s people! How our hearts rejoiced as we had unfolded to us a further vision of Jehovah’s purposes, as we learned of the expansion of the work in different parts of the earth and also at the Theocratic headquarters, and saw how all features of the work were covered during the sessions by example and precept! How marvelous that so many features of the truth could be dealt with, giving spiritual guidance and comfort to all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, too, the added information concerning the world conspiracy thrilled us with foreknowledge of impending events, and even now the heartening words ring in our ears, “God is with us!” We thanked Jehovah for the speech “The Prince of Peace”—so simple, so clear, and yet so powerful—and we know it will mean much to the many more thousands who will yet read it when published in booklet form. With gratitude we accepted the many releases, knowing they will mean so much to us In our future service. The immensity, the unity, the organization, and everything connected with this international convention, will never be forgotten; it is indelibly imprinted on our memories. We returned to our several assignments with deep-seated conviction, settled determination, renewed courage and strengthened spirit, to raise high the banner of truth and to always move forward with assurance that “God is with us”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No other people on earth should be as busy as the Lord’s people. By one’s keeping busy in the Lord’s work, time goes fast. This is true in Chile the same as it is true in all other parts of the earth where Jehovah’s witnesses are zealously aiding the people of good-will to gain a knowledge of the Kingdom. The work in Chile is not proceeding without opposition or hindrances. There are disturbances from within and from without, but despite these the organization in Chile grows rapidly. The nine companies in the land are becoming better organized and are now being served by a servant to the brethren. A new peak of 109 publishers was reached during the year, most of whom are located in the larger cities. A few isolated pioneers are reaching out into untouched fields, earnestly endeavoring to get the work done before the final end.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font5">A graduate of Gilead School is Branch servant in Chile. The Society plans to send more missionaries into Chile, because of the vastness of the territory and the number of people that must yet be witnessed to. With peace and unity prevailing within the organization, the great work that must yet be done in Chile will be accomplished, by the Lord’s grace. While the little band of publishers in Chile is not large, it is sending up a mighty shout unto the Lord. Throughout the year others have joined the brethren in praising Jehovah. A few paragraphs taken from the lengthy report of the servant will prove to be interesting to the readers of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the work has moved ahead on a more organized basis than heretofore. Through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font4">letters, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> etc., we try to aid the publishers and keep them abreast of the rapid forward movement of God’s organization in the earth. Good progress has been made in organization because the publishers are willing to receive instruction and thereby better their service to the Lord. It is a joy to attend a meeting now and see it progress smoothly in line with organization instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such efforts at better organization of the witness work and the introduction of the campaign feature have not lacked the Lord’s blessing. It is true that the total of pieces of literature placed have dropped sharply when compared with that of the previous year. A glance at the bound book figures, however, offers an explanation. Where the booklet placements have dropped 44 percent, the bound book placements have increased 69 percent. The publishers are following the campaign offers announced in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font4">which have stressed the placement of bound books so as to start studies. And what about subscriptions? Were the Kingdom publishers campaign-minded? Let the figures speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almost all of the work accomplished during the year was done in the few cities or towns where there are established companies. Keeping in mind that there are only 9 established companies in the country, we are conscious of the enormous task before us, to gradually extend the witness throughout the land. Good progress has been made in this respect. During the service year a new company was established in the far north in the free port of Arica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The extension of the witness work proceeded to the south also. A pioneer brother who has rendered faithful service in Concepcidn for the past few years was given the privilege to carry the witness into a new field, a city of some 50,000 people who had never heard of the Kingdom message, except for some witnessing done there on one occasion by some of the friends from Santiago. After a few months of diligent effort this brother has succeeded in starting out two new publishers in the field service and reports that as high as 15 persons of good-will attend the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-totcer</span><span class="font4"> study. So encouraging are his reports that it was thought well to route the servant to the brethren there to see what can be done to organize a company. This pioneer has since been enrolled as a special and will continue his good work in his assigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two units are now functioning in Santiago, the capital. With the establishment of the new Branch office it was thought wise to likewise organize a new unit with headquarters at the Branch office because of the geographical advantage of such an arrangement and the time element involved in travel. The Lord has blessed this arrangement. Eight months ago the new unit started out with two publishers and gradually advanced to 14 reporting in August. As high as 35 have attended the meetings here. The other unit with headquarters at the former depot of the Society is also doing good work, advancing gradually to a peak of 57 publishers in May, which is 11 over their last year’s peak of 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the coming of summer and the vacation period in the latter part of 1945, a call was sent out through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> for summer-vacation pioneers. It was good to see a willing response of 8 of these young Jonadabs and publishers of the Kingdom. Two of these, still in their first decade, reported 210 hours each in one month, an example of determination that others would do well to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneer activity was given impetus with the arrival of 10 more Gilead-trained missionaries in the latter part of 1945. All of these were assigned to Santiago, which represents one-fifth of the entire population of the country. Although handicapped by language, new ways and customs and a complete change from the northern to the southern hemisphere these publishers pitched into their missionary activity with zeal. Starting their foreign service in the midst of the 1946 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign did not dampen their zeal any. By the end of April they had entered over 300 of the 513 subscriptions taken during the campaign! The spirit of the Lord operating in their members overcame the barriers and the work moved forward with the marvelous results mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many are the experiences and blessings of the special pioneers by reason of their full-time service. Many could be mentioned, but one is outstanding. It was a letter received by one of the specials which speaks for itself. It follows in part: “Dear Mr. -----: Today when I came</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">home my wife told me about your kind way to treat people as you did to her. I feel obliged to write these few words to you to express my admiration at your wonderful way to elevate morals and my astonishment that in these times still are men ready to sacrifice their time so other people will have some hope.” This letter came from a businessman. Daily these brethren encounter appreciative listeners, and some of these good-will persons have taken their stand and are now publishers. The seed sown during the past year will, through proper care, take root In the months to come. The prospects are therefore marvelous. It is good to know that just as soon as voyage can be booked the special pioneer ranks here will be fortified by the arrival of 9 more Gilead-trained missionaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Be glad, ye nations, with his people,” announced Paul centuries ago. That prophecy is being fulfilled today in a marvelous way throughout this inhabited earth. For the privilege of making glad some of the Lord’s “other sheep” in this land, we are grateful. We now look forward to a new year of activity with confidence knowing that Jehovah is with us to accomplish in us his purpose. We take this opportunity to send greetings to our brethren world-wide, and to the Bethel family at headquarters, wishing all the rich blessing of the Lord during the coining year. May it be the Lord’s good pleasure to have the president of the Society visit us soon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is a large territory, and the workers are few. The few there are very anxious to have the witness given in that land, for they know the need of the Chinese people to learn of God. It is the sincere desire of the brethren to make glad these people with Jehovah’s chosen ones. They would like to see this nation praising the Most High. Undoubtedly the Lord will open up the way for a greater witness to be given in this territory, and it makes our hearts glad to know that seed is planted and that good work is being done there now. By the Lord’s grace, we will give our brethren every assistance possible to carry on this good work. A report comes from our brethren in Shanghai which is very interesting, and it is set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After three years of oppressive war this is the first year that we are able to send you a report of work done. We are glad that again we are able to pick up our works. Our work center has been concentrated only in Shanghai city because, financially, we could not afford to go elsewhere, as all the Society’s property has been lost. Through Chinese inflation the work could not be pushed entirely forward, and therefore the difficulties. Nevertheless nothing has been left undone iu an effort to inform people of the most important message about the King of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly after the war there were difficulties with transportation and therefore we could not quickly enough get our badly needed literature. So at the beginning of the year we helped ourselves with the leaflets. They were in the form of questions, and people were obliged themselves to look in their owu Bible for the answer. Bight after the armistice a secoud bunch of leaflets was printed suiting the time, and through such methods we could easier reach the private homes of the people. Some articles have been published by us in the popular newspaper free of charge. As we were at the end of the leaflets we received a part of the long-awaited spiritual food from the headquarters. With great eagerness and happiness we rushed for it to quench our thirst. Soon after we received a big lot of literature by steamer. Of course, the Devil did everything possible to make things for us as difficult as possible! And It took us nearly two months’ time to get our literature free from customs, and on top of it we were charged a big sum of money for the release of our books (thousands of Shanghai currency), which nearly shocked us. The brother in charge here left nothing undone, even going up to the highest officials. The result was that he succeeded in getting the literature free of duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the month of June, 1946, we started our real active work from house to house, with our new literature at hand. Those who loved the Lord with their whole heart expressed their readiness to serve him. The pioneers gave up their former temporary worldly work, and took up again the full-time Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Working house-to-house, one of our sisters came in touch with the American military officials that were especially assigned for clearing the misdeeds of the enemy. They also wanted our statement regarding Ill-treating some of our brethren and also about closing down our Branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother of Chinese nationality from the interior of China, the province of Schansi, who is a good Kingdom publisher, wishes to become a full-time pioneer. But since the civil war broke out the parcel post has been closed down, and therefore he at present cannot receive any literature from us. As you see, he is prevented from taking up full pioneer service at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the last months we have built up a very interesting meeting which is mainly made up of educated and fine Chinese people. They are very much interested in the book study, which is held regularly every week. This meeting is held with a very fine Chinese family, at their home, and every meeting more and more of their own friends join the meeting. Two of this family are already working in the house-to-house service, and so their love and gratefulness to the Lord is made manifest. Besides the Chinese meetings we also regularly hold a book study under the German group, which is very enthusiastic in the witness work. Willingly each one of them does his share in the work. Regularly we have our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study in the English language for the Russian brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the last Memorial 10 persons were present and 3 of them partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are four pioneers and eight company publishers doing all they can under present conditions. They devoted 3,413 hours to field service and placed 2,678 books and booklets. Back-calls are being made and book studies conducted in the homes of interested people. It is hoped that it will not be too long before some brethren from Gilead are sent into China to work alongside us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is our deepest desire and hoped-for privilege to have you, Brother Knorr, among us in China, so that we can discuss the most important, practical, useful and progressive Kingdom service in China, as you have done already in many other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank our Lord for all special blessings during this last year, and also for still keeping us as his true servants. We promise him anew, that wherever it might be, we will work for the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Before the Gilead graduates went to Colombia to carry the message of the Kingdom to the people of that land the Society in Brooklyn had reports from someone who was preaching the gospel away back in the Andes mountains. When the first special pioneers arrived in Colombia they didn’t even know where the place was located. During the first year more Gilead brethren arrived, meetings began in Bogota, service instructions were given to the newly interested, and a company was formed in the capital city, and still no time to visit our distant brethren. There were many obstacles to overcome: religious prejudice, climate, language, in their new assignment. However, the little group of Gilead graduates kept marching on, knowing full well that “this gospel of the kingdom” had to be preached in Colombia the same as in other parts of the world. They thanked the Lord for their assignment and hoped some day to meet these isolated brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report by the Branch servant sets out a very interesting story of how the special pioneers finally found, not only one of Jehovah’s witnesses away back in the Andes, but dozens of them. In this instance one person who had learned the truth believed it, preached it, and Jehovah poured his holy spirit upon him. Jehovah’s power is unlimited—but let us read the Branch servant’s report about the new company that was found in Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By January, 1946, fifteen persons of good-will were regularly attending </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and service meetings. Seven of these persons of good-will were engaging regularly In field service and all of them wished to be immersed. Arrangements were made for this on the last Sunday of January. We could find no place in Bogota for the immersion, so we went down the mountain by bus to a place called Mesitas del Colegio, where there is a warm, clean river. The chartered bus was packed with 25 persons, while five others got there by the regular bus, making a total of thirty who witnessed the immersion. The trip down the mountain was very interesting, and since we dropped down to about 4,000 feet we got a taste of warm weather and also a view of tropical vegetation. Banana trees, coffee plants, bamboo trees, beautiful birds and flowers, were in profusion. The countryside was dotted with beautiful Spanish homes surrounded by plantations, and Roman Catholic churches surrounded by dirty Indian villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someday perhaps there will be companies and pioneers throughout Colombia to take care of this vast territory. A company arrangement was immediately put into effect so that the new publishers could be properly trained in Theocratic organization and service. At the time it was thought that this was the first company operating in Colombia, for it wasn’t till much later that we heard that there was a company away back in the mountains, nearly 1,000 feet higher than this little company of Bogota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Already the work of the Gilead brethren was being greatly blessed; this In spite of the fact that many of the brethren suffered sickness from colds and weakness due partly to the high altitude of 8,602 feet and the cold, rainy weather. But they were blessed far more. On February 25 word came that Brother Knorr and Brother Franz would serve Bogota April 12-17. Since there would be no public meeting, the publishers immediately began telling the people of good-will at their back-calls and book studies about this visit of the president and vice-president of the Society and inviting them to attend a special meeting on Sunday, April 14. By this time the number of attendance at company meetings had increased to about thirty, so we hoped that with extra effort 50 might attend this special meeting. But to our joy and delight, even though this Sunday was a special fiesta day for the pagan “Easter” celebration and it was raining most of the day, 87 persons were on hand to hear Brother Knorr deliver the talk “Be Glad, Ye Nations, with His People”. The joy and appreciation at hearing this heart-cheering message was manifest in the comments of gratitude to Brother Knorr by many of the good-will persons present. Though many of them were Catholic, there was no mistake in their mind that this message rang true. It was no doubt responsible- for helping several more persons of good-will to take their stand definitely on the side of truth and right and in sharing in the work of telling it to others, because the number of company publishers jumped to 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two local publishers were able to accept that Invitation to attend the Cleveland assembly. The reports that were received by letter and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font4"> were indeed thrilling. Certainly Jehovah poured out his spirit at that assembly and caused great joy and renewed zeal to be instilled in the hearts of all in attendance and all brethren the world over. Certainly it did wonders here in Colombia by proving to the people of good-will that this is no puny sect, but is Jehovah’s organization operating by Jehovah’s spirit and growing and growing till it will eventually fill the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of the fiscal year contact by letter was made with a brother at Paz del Rio, high up in the Andes mountains, 150 miles straight north of here. All we knew about the place was that there was a publisher there who was sending in a monthly report of service to Brooklyn and that he lived somewhere in Paz del Rio. Arrangements were made for Brother Brodeur to spend two days up there to see what could be done to help the brother and other persons of good-will if any. He left by train at 6:35 a.m. and reached Dultama, 140 miles from Bogota and as far as the train could take him. This trip took nine hours, so it was necessary to stay here overnight. The next morning he flagged down a truck loaded with freight which was headed toward Paz del Rio. For one peso he got a ride to within half a mile of the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On entering the town he asked the first man he saw as to the whereabouts of Mr. Hernandez, the company servant. The man said, “Oh, you are one of the brothers from the Sociedad, No?” He was taken to a relative in town who showed Brother Brodeur where to go over the mountains to find Brother Hernandez. There were high mountains all around and a pretty stream running along the edge of the town of maybe 1,000 population. The relative, whose name was Senor Incarnacidn Estupinar, showed him a rocky trail straight up over the mountains by which he could reach the place in a few hours. Brother Brodeur started out but it was so steep in places he had to take off his belt and use it to strap his suitcase and book bag over his shoulder so he would have both hands free to climb. It was three times as far to go by road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eventually Brother Brodeur began to see mud huts scattered through the mountains and soon two boys came running up saying, “Are you the brother from the Sociedad?” He found out later that they had not received the notice of his coining because they hadn’t picked up their mail in town. The company servant only knew that we wanted to get in touch with him but he told everybody that someday someone would come. These little boys insisted on carrying the bags and they plodded on up the mountain till they met a man who introduced himself as a brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Juan Bautista informed Brother Brodeur that the company servant lived yet a couple more hours up the mountains, and since it was nearly dark now he had better stay at the Kingdom Hall! They walked another half an hour over more rough, rocky terrain till they came to a mud-and-stone house, better than any of the rest in the mountains. When entering the main room the first thing that met the eye was a large poster reading “Photo-Drama of Creation”, etc. Then all around the room were pictures of all the big conventions since 1933. Everything in this room was very neat and clean and It was the only floor in the mountains that Brother Brodeur saw that was of concrete. It is kept locked up except when they get together every other week to study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> They fixed him a bed on the floor in the Kingdom Hall, as all the other floors In the house were of dirt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By now he had met about 12 persons all Introduced as brethren. Everybody treated him as though he were a king, never addressing him in the second person, but always, “Will the brother speak tonight?” or “Would the brother like to eat now?” All of them are the Indian type Colombian with ruanas and all. The family of Juan Bautista lived in this home. After a supper of potatoes, rice and the regular soup which all Indians here eat with a wooden spoon Juan told Brother Brodeur that others were coming over in a little while to hear him speak. He had prepared a one-hour talk In Spanish for Sunday, but hadn’t figured on any other and there wasn’t time for preparation now. But he got along all right, talking particularly on the subject of Jehovah’s having only one channel through which he Instructs his people. (This since Juan had told that several used to believe in the truth but now go also to Evangelist meetings on the other side of the mountains.) Fifteen were present. At the close of the meeting arrangements were made for field service in the morning in Paz del Rio and five agreed to go. The company servant was there, an old, spry man of 76 years, fully in harmony with the truth but pretty well set in old methods of organization, and many of his own. He has a complete record in a book of each book placed since 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next morning, Sunday, they started down the mountain to the village for service. The company servant went off by himself, while Juan took one new publisher and Brother Brodeur another, placing seven books. At 12 o’clock they went to the plaza, where they met the company servant, who had picked up his mail and his regular roll of 30 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> for the thirty subscribers in those parts. He was handing them out as he found them buying in the plaza market. He explained that he thought it was better to get all the magazines in his name and hand them out each Sunday when everybody and his brother came to market once a week. Brother Brodeur had the privilege of witnessing to about 100 persons in the plaza, explaining the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> placing several books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meeting was set for 3 p.m. up at the Kingdom Hall, so they started up the trail on horseback. All the way up as they met others they called out to them, “The meeting Is at 3 p.m. and the baptism at 4 p.m.” Juan had told Brother Brodeur that morning that five wanted to be immersed, but when they looked at the river it was only knee-deep. But when it came time to baptize, the river was nearly four feet deep. One of Juan’s boys had worked all day building a mud dam, making a nice deep pool</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They got back to the Kingdom hall at 2: 45 p.m., but when three o’clock came not a soul was there. At 3:30 still no one. At 3:45 still no one. Then at 3:55 one of Juan’s little boys came running in saying, “Here they come.” Sure enough, they all came at once in a bunch; and as they stepped Into the hall each one in rapid succession said, “Buenas tardes, Buenas tardes, Buenas tardes,” and sat down. In no time 41 persons had packed out the room and patio. All paid rapt attention while Brother Brodeur talked on the blessings of the Kingdom, organization and service. Following this he gave the baptism talk and all went to the river to witness the immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everybody thanked Brother Brodeur profusely and begged him to stay a week, and practically refused to let him go. But he managed to satisfy them only after he said that, since they didn’t receive notice of his coming In time to let everyone know, It might be that in about two months perhaps not only he but also the Branch servant will come up there and put on a public lecture at the plaza. Late that night the company servant came over and said he had spoken to a businessman in town and he had offered a hall free for the occasion! Brother Hernandez and Juan Bautista assured Brother Brodeur that there are others whom they couldn’t contact in time, who live scattered through the mountains, who want to be immersed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak number of publishers for 1946 service year 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So with the end of August and one year of service In Colombia we find Instead of no publishers in September 1945, there are now 29 publishers. Because the work is now organized, more Gilead graduates are expected soon, a missionary home has been established in Barranquilla, the work is being spread to other parts of the country, and by Jehovah’s mighty spirit much more may be accomplished during 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following out of Jesus’ command, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all nations,” has brought Jehovah’s rich blessing in this land. Nearly three years ago two Gilead graduates were sent into Costa Rica. There was only a handful of publishers then holding high the banner of the Lord. They needed guidance and instruction. Today Jehovah’s witnesses in Costa Rica are taking seriously their divinely appointed task as “vinedressers”' and “plowmen” in the Lord’s organization. The “other sheep” have come forward and, as a result, more and more people in Costa Rica are learning to be glad with His people by studying with them, attending the meetings at company headquarters, and taking part in the field service.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font5">Costa Rica has reached a new peak in publishers, 377 now praising Jehovah. The work of these earnest publishers is becoming better known every day; and now the good news not only is heard in the large cities but is reaching into the rural sections. The zeal of the brethren is well shown by the year report. The Branch servant and his wife were called to the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland, and in his absence his assistant gives news that makes our heart glad. Excerpts from his cheerful letter follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In June Brother Blackburn completed a three-week trip to the seven English-speaking companies and reported a very fine time. One day he with some of the brethren walked 18 miles to get to some isolated territory. His written report on this trip is very interesting and worth quoting from. He says: “The zeal and the love for The Theocracy shown by these brethren is to be admired. The brethren are financially poor, yet they are very liberal to take the Society’s servants into their homes and give them the best they have to offer. They are meek and desire instructions. . . . They are not complainers because of having to walk miles through the heat and mud to make back-calls and studies. . . . Thankful to the Lord and the Society are they for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font4"> and other aids to help them in their limited education. . . . Peace and unity exists among them. . . . They are progressing in efficiency but need assistance. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even though the trip was rough, with rain every day and plenty of mud, the brethren were well pleased with the public meeting attendance. The public invited me hack, asking for the “next lecture”. ... To me this trip was a joyful one and I appreciated all the comforts enjoyed in the homes of the brethren. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much was accomplished on this trip. Brother Blackburn went into the territories with the brethren, made maps for them and so divided their individual territories that every one would have sufficient to work effectively. He showed them how to make better use of their time and to work more on back-calls and book studies where the population is not so great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Spanish companies cannot be served on a continuous trip, as they are more scattered. Quepos is best reached by air from San Jose, Grecia by bus, Puntarenas by the Pacific Railway, and Pital by bus and horseback. Pital is a new company, made up of about five or six new brethren, and as yet has not had a visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Spanisli brethren are also learning the Society’s methods for a better presentation of the gospel message. This is evident by the fact that these companies have grown beyond our expectations. Puntarenas, for example, was a company of five or six publishers two years ago and now they have more than twenty-five active publishers. Regular visits and public meetings during each visit have been a great factor in instructing these brethren, and they appreciate the Society’s help in the form of the servants’ visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr’s visit this year was far too short; however, it was a timely one and the brethren that were able to attend the mid-week assembly were greatly benefited. No hall for a full-day assembly of the brethren was available; so the American Theater was rented from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon. Brother Knorr spoke in English and Brother Franz interpreted into Spanish for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evening session was to be a meeting for the pioneers, but even before the announced hour the Kingdom Hall was packed out and all standing space was filled even to the stairs leading from the street. Time to say good-bye came all too soon, but time prevented </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> longer assembly. All, however, were glad for this opportunity to have the Society’s president and vice-president with us and the many good things we heard shall be long remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest activity along this line is in the San JosS company. Here we use the Kingdom Hall and advertise a series of four lectures in one-fourth of the city at a time. The hall is always packed with from 100 to 130 attending each lecture. The brethren support these meetings well, both in advertising and bringing good-will persons to the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two series of four lectures were put on in English in Port Limon during the past year. A Gilead graduate from San Jos6 was sent down for each lecture. The Port Limon brethren appreciated this very much, as is shown by their progress and the healthy support given these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No event of the year was more talked about than the Glad Nations Assembly in Cleveland, Ohio. The travel arrangements of the seven delegates from Costa Rica worked out fine and all arrived on time for the convention. The joys of the convention were reflected to us through prompt receipt of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> and the releases. Three of the delegates have since returned full of enthusiasm and news. The Society’s provision that the Branch servant and his wife go to the convention was very much appreciated by the brethren, and we are awaiting a full account from them as well as further instructions concerning the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as in many other places, the Kingdom publishers in Costa Rica have no automobiles. For many, just getting a book bag is quite an expense. The rainy season lasts for more than half the year, but in spite of these and other obstacles they do get out in service and though opposition grows stronger they know that Jehovah will give them his joy while they keep on and that the enemy can never stop them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Looking back over the past year’s service we rejoice in the privileges that were ours, in the wholehearted cooperation of the brethren in every way, and in the manifest sustenance, protection and blessing through our Commander. Our determination is yet keener as we view the coming year knowing that it will bring even greater things and that our joy shall grow as we throw everything we have into the grand campaign for truth and righteousness, bringing gladness to men of good-will. Laying aside everything else and pushing on we are confident that victory shall be ours and that we shall ultimately rejoice together with our brethren in the vindication of our God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For zeal, forward action, and evidence of the peoples’ taking up the song of Jehovah’s glad nation, Cuba is a marvelous example. Peace reigns among the brethren throughout all of Cuba. They are zealous to help one another, not only their brethren, but the people in all the land, with a knowledge of the truth. There are no obstacles too great for them to surmount. It is indeed a pleasure to read of the year’s work; for in this report you can see the zeal and determination of Kingdom publishers to carry this message to the ends of the earth. In many lands the obstacles are not as great as those set before our Cuban brethren. Their zeal is to be admired, and their example followed. The report of the Branch servant is live and heart-cheering. Excerpts therefrom are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As was true last year, the company book-study arrangement continues to be one of the main factors in the great increases in publishers. The diligent efforts put forth by the brethren in fully co-operating and working with the company book-study groups has been richly blessed by the Lord. Eight of the new companies that were organized during 1946 were former company book studies. One of the companies that has the company book-study work well organized is the Central Unit of Havana. Last year this company was divided up and a new unit started when a peak of 265 publishers was reached. This year this unit hit a peak of 307 publishers. Again a new unit was formed from this one. And now, the latest report from the Central Unit shows 211 publishers in the field! In two and a half years’ time the publishers in the Habana area have increased from 110 to over 500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This increase has come not only in the metropolitan areas of the country; the companies in the scattered rurals have also shown remarkable increases. About six years ago a new rural company composed of one single publisher was organized. For over two years’ time after this company was formed no more than just this one publisher participated in the service. However, this brother continued on faithfully in the work by himself having full faith that the Lord whom he served would bless his efforts. In the Lord’s due time the increase came. And now Instead of one publisher we find three companies there, with 109 publishers participating regularly. In last year’s report an experience was related showing how a pioneer working in a territory that had never before been worked had been able to organize a company of 18 publishers. This company has since grown to 93 publishers. Nine new pioneers have also come out of this company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One cannot help but admire the zeal and diligence of our brethren who live in the rurals to advance the Kingdom interests in spite of the many obstacles they have to overcome. Many of the brethren, particularly the older ones, have learned how to read and write after coming to a knowledge of the truth. Imagine new brethren of 55 years of age and over who were previously illiterate learning how to read and write and doing a good job of it! A few years ago a brother who did not know how to read and write was appointed as a company servant. Now he has learned how to read and write, and conducts the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and service meetings. Since he lias been company servant the company has increased from 2 to 30 publishers. These brethren since coming to a knowledge of the truth and seeing the importance of reading and writing have put forth an effort to learn, so that they might be more able ministers of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Practically all of the brethren living in the rurals travel to and from their territory on foot. Most of their walking is done on dirt roads and narrow footpaths. You can just imagine the difficulties in this kind of territory when it rains. And that’s just what it did. The last four months witnessed some of the heaviest rains that we have ever had. It seemed as if it rained every day. However, in spite of this these brethren living in the rurals went forth regularly in the service. Many times they had to slog through mud ankle-deep. During these four months practically every one of these rural companies hit new peaks in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the servants to the brethren walked 40 miles on a quaggy muddy road with a group of 30 brethren to give a scheduled public talk. One company servant has to walk 60 miles on foot at the beginning of every month in order to send his company’s report in to the Society. And in the rainy season, when the rivers are swollen over, this brother crosses the rivers by climbing high up the trees and then walking across the big limbs of the trees that bridge these small rivers. Truly the Lord has blessed the willing and zealous efforts of those brethren!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneers have been very diligent in pushing ahead and organizing the work. One of the native special pioneers has organized seven companies; another native special has organized four companies; and another, three companies. The work of the graduates of Gilead School has also been very richly blessed by the Lord. At the present there are 39 Gilead brethren serving as specials. Nine more new ones are expected in September and October. In every city that the Gilead graduates have been sent into there has been a large increase in publishers and activity. The Gilead graduates in Havana have personally started in the service about 100 of the 500 publishers in the Havana area. Indirectly they have also aided in the Increase in this area by giving much personal instruction and aid to many of those that were already publishing, thus making these brethren more efficient publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little over a year ago, when a group of Gilead brethren were first sent into the city of Santa Clara, there was no company there, and only one single publisher living in the city. Today there is an organized company of 38 publishers reporting service in Santa Clara. At the same time as these special pioneers were sent into Santa Clara another group of .School graduates were sent to the city of Camaguey. When they arrived in Camaguey there was a weak company of five publishers there. Now they have a strong company of 45 publishers. In addition to these 45 publishers, three pioneers have started out in the service from this company. The companies in Ciejjfuegos and Matanzas have also had great increases in activity and publishers, and have become much stronger companies since the Gilead pioneers have been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting work has greatly aided the increase in publishers throughout the land. Many of the brethren who have taken their stand for the Kingdom during the past year have come in as a direct result of this new and mighty instrument of the Lord. The people of good-will have flocked to these meetings. A total of 55,293 persons heard the public talks during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the third week in February word was received that Brothers Knorr and Franz would visit us in early March. Arrangements were to be made for two assemblies, one in Havana and the other in Camaguey. We had just 17 days to make arrangements for these assemblies. Halls had to be rented, talks had to be translated, rooming accommodations had to be obtained, folders, placards, programs and other convention printing had to be done, cafeterias had to be arranged for, as well as many other things in connection with a convention. By the Lord’s grace we were able to complete the full convention arrangements before the starting dates. With the help of the Inspector of radio in Cuba we were able to obtain the largest and best auditorium in the country, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Palacio de Convenciones y Deportes, </span><span class="font4">for the public talk in Havana. Another large and attractive hall was rented for ail the other meetings of the Havana assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Havana convention was the best yet. A total of 1,510 persons heard Brother Knorr deliver the public talk “Be Glad, Ye Nations”. Over 800 of those attending were goodwill Interest. The convention at Camaguey was held two days after the one at Havana. A crowd of 1,200 that packed out the hall and overflowed into the streets attentively heard the Society’s president deliver the public talk. The total of over 2,700 persons attending the two conventions is the highest to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the intense enjoyment of all the conventioners, and as a complete surprise to all, Brother Knorr released two new publications in Spanish, the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Netc World, </span><span class="font4">and the much-needed booklet on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions for the Kingdom Publisher.</span><span class="font4"> At both assemblies Brother Knorr extended an invitation to the brethren to attend the Cleveland convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seventy-four of the publishers from Cuba were able to accept this invitation and were present at the great Glad Nations Assembly in Cleveland. Fifty-five of these brethren were pioneers. Upon their return to Cuba many were the joyful experiences that these brethren recounted to those who were not able to attend the international assembly. The new Spanish concordance that was released at the convention will be a very great aid to the brethren here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the increased work at the Branch, two new members were added to the Branch force during the year. At the time of writing this report a brother was sent down here from the States to operate our newly-acquired job press. One of the members of the Branch family has had the privilege of being called to Gilead to attend the eighth class.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s “glad” people here In Cuba give thanks to the Lord for the bountiful blessings and privileges of service bestowed upon them during the past service year, and with glad hearts they will continue to join together with their brethren world-wide in the ever-swelling chorus to all peoples, kindreds and tongues of “Be Glad, Ye Nations, with His People”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the time of Nazi rule the land of Czechoslovakia was robbed and plundered. Even in their retreat the Nazi hordes destroyed everything possible, including bridges and railroads, and this makes it very difficult for people to travel now. Jehovah’s witnesses find it inconvenient to get around, but they do get around in preaching the gospel. Conditions at present are much better than in the oppressive concentration camps, and the peacemakers in Czechoslovakia are bringing joy and gladness to the good people of that land. Many are seizing the opportunity of now becoming fighters for the New World of righteousness. The 1,209 publishers reporting during the year are carrying forward valiantly, and the report shows how these lovers of peace are now taking the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">message of comfort to their oppressors. What follows is from the year report of the Branch servant in Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the very beginning of the service year we made strenuous efforts to reorganize and establish the companies so that the work might be done more effectively. In the first place arrangements were made to provide the brethren again regularly with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font4">which they had sorely missed so long. It was a special joy for us to produce the new articles here again, and with all the brethren to enjoy the spiritual food from the Lord’s table, which makes us strong for the work of the postwar period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It became necessary to register the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as a local association in the same way as it had been before the war. This matter was immediately taken up; the authorities were courteous and obliging and in December 1945 the activity of the Society was authorized. This arrangement proved of special blessing In the months that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a still further step in our reconstruction work several booklets were printed in the Czech and Slovakian languages. It was very stimulating and inspired great joy when the message could again be carried in printed form to the people of good-will. The great difficulty in obtaining paper supplies, and to persuade a printer to print the booklets at all, impedes the work seriously, however. If not all necessities could be adequately covered in this respect, then one must consider under what straitened circumstances the work must be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the same reasons the pioneer work could not be freely developed. In addition, it is very hal’d for the brethren, owing to existing official measures in the labor market, to break from their former occupations and to enter the field as full-time publishers. However, we hope to be able to accomplish more in the pioneer service during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 11th November 1945 the Prague company arranged a public lecture again after many years. With renewed enthusiasm the brethren greeted this further opportunity and joyfully advertised the event. “Freedom in the New World” was the theme chosen, and about 600 persons listened attentively to the comfort-bringing explanations and descriptions of the New World of freedom and righteousness. This lecture was of yet greater significance, for it constituted the starting-signal for the tremendous public witness campaign which the Lord’s people here are to carry out during the coming weeks and months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brethren worked In the district of Ujlak (eastern Slovakia) preaching the glad tidings of God’s kingdom. Hearing of this an infuriated Greek-Catholic priest started stirring up some men and women against the publishers. Then he proceeded to the school and caused the teacher to let about 300 children onto the streets to attack God’s witnesses with various missiles. Thus the brethren were driven to the police station, where they were briefly questioned; but no blame could be found in them. In fact, they were very politely treated here, and the police officials even contributed for two booklets each from the brethren, releasing them with friendly handshakes. When this riotous mob saw this, however, they raged still more and chased the publishers of the gospel with sticks and stones two and a half kilometers out of the town, beating and mocking them, and some had their clothing torn from their backs. This mob of 350 adults and children who allowed themselves to be used as tools of the clergy was not ashamed to ill-treat one old lady so badly that she had to take to her bed for some weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This example demonstrates quite clearly again with what methods the clergy fight against The Theocracy in order to continue to hold their sheep further in darkness. They break the law of the Most High and Ignore the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen freedom of the worship of God. They are seditious, whereas Jehovah’s witnesses carry a message of goodness, rejoicing to the heart. Violence is the sole argument of this rule by priests and it misuses even school children for its base purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another incident: In Klenova (eastern Slovakia again) the population incited by the priest beat up some of Jehovah’s witnesses till the blood flowed, and only the military frontier guards saved them from the hands of the mob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the servants of the Most High do not become discouraged ; they continue to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name. They take advantage of every opportunity of giving the witness, and the Lord blesses them in their endeavors, as is testified by the following excerpt from a report received here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With these few lines we would like to express the deep joy which we experienced during this week in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At the last service meeting we decided to visit the Germans (mostly Nazis) in the internment camps and to bring them the message of the Kingdom, as they now have time to think about it For do we not bear the responsibility for their lives too, as testified in Ezekiel 33 and in other injunctions of the Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The brethren were at first a little doubtful as they each received their 50 booklets, but I emphasized that the Lord would surely show us the way if we leaned to him in prayer; that he would open up the doors so closely guarded by armed sentries and bless our work. The brethren were separated into small groups and each group appointed to a camp. Sunday morning, the 11th November, the work began. I went with the two sisters appointed to me to the castle where the camp assigned to us was situated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“First of all, the Slovakian commander received a witness and three other officials listened, the two sisters approaching first while I waited outside. All four took a booklet and out of courtesy gave a contribution of Kes. 10.- each. Then came my opportunity. . . . After thoroughly examining our identity cards the commander said: ‘Well, you’re Czechs and it is certain you’ll not make any political propaganda. The booklets too seem to be free from political alms; and anyway, I know the fate of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany.’ Turning to his colleague he said, ‘Lead them from door to door’; and at this we drew a deep breath once more, while silent prayers of gratitude ascended from our hearts to the Lord. The internees who stood around in the courtyard he ordered immediately into the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The first door to be opened disclosed a room with about 50 persons present, among whom were many well known to us, persons who till recently had ridiculed and driven us from their apartments. Farmers, officials, teachers, and in one room even a clergyman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ ‘Good morning, gentlemen! We are visiting you in a matter of life importance and we would ask you to give us your attention for a few minutes . . . ’ With these words we entered the room, and for 15 to 20 minutes they all had to listen to our witness. Then the booklets were offered and most of them took a booklet against a voluntary contribution and expressed their desire that we visit them again, which we also promised to do. Only a few goats withdrew themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In this way we visited 8 rooms always with the same procedure; first a good witness, then the booklets. We spent almost four hours here and placed 247 booklets and 120 back numbers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Trost.</span><span class="font4"> The guard who accompanied us understood German too, arid so we were allowed to speak in this language to these people. The guard himself took several booklets and wished to be visited again in his private apartment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With hearts beating high with joy we passed out of the great gateway. We see that it is Jehovah of hosts who is leading this work and who opens the doors for his people and commands: ‘Be still, and hear my judgment!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The other brethren too had similar success and experienced that boundless joy which cannot be expressed in words. Next Sunday we want to visit four other camps, and trust that the Lord will also crown our efforts with success.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Is but one example of the unspeakable joy which Jehovah bestows upon those who serve him with undivided hearts, and who do not allow themselves to be restrained in the true worship of God either by evil or by hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the border regions of Bohemia and Moravia many hundred brethren of German tongue have been carrying out faithfully their witness work. Owing to present circumstances many have already had to leave this country, and it looks as though hardly any will be able to remain. However, we are endeavoring to establish Czech companies In these regions now so vacated, so that the gospel may continue to be preached here. In southern and eastern Slovakia there are also a number of Hungarian brethren who are not able yet to freely develop their ministry work. But they too are doing all in their power to sing forth Jehovah’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A most pleasing and encouraging event of the year was the special gift of our beloved American brethren consisting of 80 big eases of clothing, underwear and shoes of more than 10 tons net weight. When the companies were informed of this gift by circular letter, many joyful expressions of gratitude were received here. This readiness of our American brothers and sisters to assist confirms anew how firmly the bonds of unity and mutual love bind the citizens of the new righteous world. The distribution among the brethren has now been completed, and 676 men, 844 women and 622 children up to 14 years have received gifts. We herewith transmit their heartfelt thanks to the givers, and, above all, gratitude, worship and praise ascend to the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Our hearts rejoice that Jehovah has so richly blessed us in the past year in spite of so many difficulties and has privileged us with the opportunity of standing for him and his righteous cause, and our fervent desire is that he may continue to show his favor toward us in the future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Coming to the close of the year is a joyful occasion for any Branch office. It affords a few moments to reflect and observe the Lord’s blessing upon the activities for the preceding twelve months. The publishers in Denmark have done well; and since the war ended in their land they have devoted more time and energy to the publishing of the good news of the Kingdom. Throughout the entire war period the brethren did not slack their hands. Because of this they are reaping good results now. While the publishers have greatly increased over the former year, so have the hours spent in service. The observations and comparisons made by the Branch servant are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be in position where one can observe the sum of the various activities of Jehovah’s servants is a great blessing and encouragement, for here one sees true love and devotion and an intelligent zeal for Jehovah’s righteous cause, the like of which is unknown outside of the Theocratic organization. In the year past, exploits have been done which give evidence of the backing of Jehovah and the firm support of his spirit. “Jehovah is pleased with his people; he adorns the humble with victory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While some have grown weary in well-doing and have left the ranks of the Lord’s fighters for righteousness, others have joined up and are rejoicing in the service. When we look at the work as a whole, it is certainly encouraging to see how many it has pleased Jehovah to enlighten concerning his purposes in this tiny land. Now I know it has been said that comparisons are odious, and I know too that results in a limited sphere of activity cannot always be multiplied up and the ratio expected to remain the same in a much larger sphere, but in order to help the friends in the larger English-speaking countries to really comprehend the figures mentioned (for otherwise they are purposeless), I will try to illustrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Copenhagen, for example, in the year past, there have been over a thousand publishers out each month. To express that in terms of Greater London or New York, it would mean that there would be at least 8,000 publishers regularly taking part in each of these cities. This means, of course, that all territory is covered frequently, and while from the point of view of placements one could sometimes wish there were more territory, nevertheless the results from the work prove that the instructions we received through the organization, to the effect that we should work repeatedly through the same district, were correct and to the furtherance of the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Copenhagen recently 240 men and women gave testimony, by being immersed in water, of their having consecrated themselves to do the will of Jehovah. To understand this figure in terms of the United States, one must multiply by thirty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whereas the peak figure for publishers in one month was 2,620 in 1945, in 1946 this had risen to 3,059. We hope to exceed this figure in the year which has just begun. We still aim at reaching the mark of one publisher for every thousand inhabitants and, by the Lord’s grace, we will reach it yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with the direction given by the president when visiting Denmark, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> has been printed and circulated, and is in use all over the country: all forms and circulars are now in strict conformity with the head office samples. Further, the new servants to the brethren are in full activity and the new lecture series is being used everywhere. The Lord’s people here are united in Jehovah’s service and desire to continue in it as long as they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as in the days of the apostles, so now when the Lord’s true servants are working under a central administration, a close co-operation exists between all the servants of The Theocracy in the various countries of earth. One evidence of this was the information given by the president to the effect that a consignment of 10 tons of clothing was being sent to the workers in Denmark from their brethren in America. We read that “like cold water to a weary man is good news from a far country”, and it was very refreshing indeed to hear of this practical evidence of real love and good wishes. At the beginning of this month we were able to equip the pioneers with many things they have really needed for a long time but have been unable to obtain; and now arrangements are in full swing to help the many needy publishers In the companies. We take this opportunity of thanking you, Brother Knorr, for arranging for this gift, and through you again, the many brethren who contributed so generously, and we are sure these glad givers are loved and blessed by the Lord, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We would also express our appreciation of the work of the packing department at Brooklyn, for the whole consignment gave evidence of careful forethought and efficiency in the arrangement of the articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We too, in this country, have had a little share in helping with food supplies to our brethren in other countries who are not so favorably situated as the brethren in Denmark. Although these supplies have not been on the scale we could have wished, we have, nevertheless, done all in our power to carry out the president’s instructions to the Branch office here, to help these needy brethren as much as possible. It has been a real joy for us to read the letters from our colaborers in Holland and Poland expressing appreciation of this evidence of our Father’s care for his sons and daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One very pleasant event in the year was the sending of five young men to America, at the invitation of the president, for the purpose of being trained for future Christian missionary activity at the W’atchtower Bible School of Gilead. We who “remain with the baggage” miss the companionship and loyal co-operation of these young men, but we have shared their joy as we have seen in this arrangement the possibilities of an extension of the blessed enlightening work of Jehovah’s witnesses. We pray continually for the Lord’s blessing upon the School and pupils and feel a closer connection with i^, now that we in this country have been privileged to send representatives to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The closing event of the year was the Copenhagen Gathering (August 31 to September 2), and a very happy time it was. It was apparent right from the beginning that here was a people who had come together for a purpose, and that was, to be better equipped for the service of their God and King. Great blessings were expected from the hand of Jehovah, but the faithful servants of the Lord desired also to be a blessing one to the other. The whole convention served to remind us all of the inestimable favor which is ours of understanding the purposes of Jehovah and the responsibility which is ours, from a grateful heart to proclaim the praises of our God. There were 3,000 present at the gathering and it was very refreshing once again to have the opportunity of meeting so many faithful publishers from Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the evening of Sunday September 1, the whole assembly unanimously accepted the resolution adopted at Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By reason of the fact that you so kindly sent us </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> by air mail from Cleveland, we were able to give many of the high lights of the Glad Nations Assembly. With rapt attention the publishers heard of the provision of new publications for use in the witness work and for equipping oneself for that service. The interest in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font4"> was very great, and many were the publishers who asked: “Is there any chance of our getting that book in Danish sometime?”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In April, 1945, the Society sent two Gilead graduates to the Dominican Republic. They established a missionary home in Ciudad Trujillo. Later two more joined the first couple, and as arrangements could be made to send more the Society did so. Now there are eighteen special pioneers working in different parts of the country. The larger group is in the capital and the other is at Santiago. The Dominican Republic is a Catholic-ridden country, and this is the first time the Society has sent missionaries in there to do organized work. The results are very gratifying, and the report of the Branch servant sets out some interesting experiences of the publishers in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of us love to see a garden of beautiful flowers set out, then in a few weeks begin to see little stems pushing themselves out of their entombed condition. Then gradually see them grow bigger and bigger until they are strong and able to withstand heat, rain and wind. So this has been our privilege in this small country, watching the growth of God’s organization. After much literature had been placed and many book studies started, it was seen that a Kingdom Hall was necessary to have the persons of good-will come to one centrally located place to meet with others in this country who are seeking for God’s word. A hall was made out of our living and dining rooms, and a sign constructed and hung in front of our home saying, “Salon del Reino, Los Testigos de Jehova,” meaning Kingdom Hall, the Witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many persons came out of curiosity to our studies, others seeking for His truth. As high as 40 attended our company meetings. Some came back and others did not, but those that did grew stronger and little by little they threw parts of religion off which kept them entombed away from the words of truth. A very interesting experience may be related in this regard, that happened at one of our meetings, as the brother reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A company meeting in January of 1946 had passed and the hour was late. Two or three of good-will remained at the Kingdom Hall discussing Kingdom truths with the special publishers in the Dominican Republic from the United States. Suddenly a knock at the door disclosed the presence of a youth of about 18 or 20 who had a determined look on his face and who inquired if he could get a Catholic Bible from us. He was invited to come in and sit down, and it was explained that he could indeed get a Catholic Bible, but that it would have to be delivered to him, as none was available at the Kingdom Hall. The advantages of the Spanish Modern Version Bible which was on display among other literature on the table were explained to him, together with comments on why more than one version of the Bible existed. Presently he mentioned that the Catholic catechism didn’t say what we were saying. This opening gave the opportunity to show the earnest youth that not only on that subject, but also on other things, such as purgatory, images, masses, etc., that Catholic catechism and the Bible told two different stories. As fast as he would submit catechismal ‘proof’ in support of religion’s teachings, just that fast the two-edged sword of the Bible was wielded to slash away the veil of darkness from each of the subjects under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Scriptural proof was convincing. This seed fell on good ground. A few days later this same young fellow was present at a book study which had been started at his home just the previous week. He joined his mother and several of his sisters in participation in the study and branched out in his answers to questions to show them what a great difference there is between religion and the truth. He told them that if they wanted to be sure that God would not hear their prayers they should just continue to pray to images; also that if they put confidence in the ideas of purgatory, masses, etc., they just needed to look in the Bible to see that all of that was religious tradition and not the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At every book study in his home since then lie has been the most prompt to raise his hand for quick and correct answers. Kingdom Hall meetings have rarely missed his cheerful face. And since the early part of June he has proved the sincerity of his course by having an active part in publishing the glad tidings to others at their homes. Now he is looking forward to the happy day when the doors of Gilead may be opened to him too and when he may in a greater way join the discipling of all nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Making a back-call one day I found the person not home and I took a different route in my return to learn more of the city. Shortly thereafter a hissing sound was directed to me from within a little tumbled-down shack. A voice called out in English, “What do you have there?” Walking over to the shack, I gave a witness to about four persons all of whom understood and spoke English. These people were British subjects. After this witness one of them said, “I’m engaged in this work of preaching God’s word in that church across the street,” pointing to a broken-down shack like the one he was visiting. A book study was started in English with these persons, with the preacher in attendance. Not long thereafter he asked if a study could be conducted in his church for the Spanish people who came there. To this the answer was, Yes. To these meetings many of his flock came to study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”. </span><span class="font4">True to those words three of them became free, including the preacher, who at present is conducting his own book study and having as high as 40 in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the 18 special pioneers in Dominican liepublic, 6 were sent to a city called Santiago, about 75 miles into the interior of this country. This small group, as the group before, was confronted with the same problems in this city. A house was provided by the Society for them. Out of their living and dining rooms a hall was made and the people of good-will were invited to attend the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and book studies. Not long thereafter they were having as high as 20 in attendance, and the newly interested were helping with these studies. To give you an idea of this I will relate an experience of one of the special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“About the second week in my Spanish assignment, Santiago, D.R., I met a very nice man who reads, speaks and writes Spanish, French and English. I placed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font4"> book in both Spanish and English with him, as he wanted to compare and learn English better. He also offered to help me with my Spanish; so we agreed to study the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font4"> book one hour and Spanish one hour. He is chief radio operator and his office is just across the street from where we live. As the Dominican custom is he wanted to study every day. We are now about half through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font4"> book and he is so enthused we spend most of our hour for Spanish talking the truth. He comes to all the meetings and reads the sum-up for us, and, in general, does all he can for us. He talks the truth to his office force and other people and hopes to go to the convention with us next year. He has gone with me on back-calls and, I hope, will be going from house to house soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another experience from a special pioneer confirms the hungering among the sheep class. He states: “Finding my first sheep in my foreign assignment brought great joy to my heart. Shortly after our arrival in the Dominican Republic, I came across a man who had been reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font4"> which had been given to him by someone that obtained the book while visiting in New York. He highly prized this book and had been studying it for about six years. In the meantime he was going from church to church seeking the truth. Upon making contact with him he immediately compared the publishers’ address in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Truth Shall Make You Free’</span><span class="font4"> with his well-worn </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God.</span><span class="font4"> He joyfully contributed for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription. He now has all the books obtainable In the Spanish language. I hold a weekly study at his home and he attends studies at the Kingdom Hall regularly. Now he goes with me from door to door each week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The high point of this year’s activity was the visit by Brothers Knorr and Franz to this country. Weeks before the arrival of the two brethren our book studies and back-calls were invited to hear a talk given by Brother Knorr and translated into Spanish by the vice-president of the Society, Brother Franz. Seventy-five of our back-call book studies came to hear a talk and instructions given in their language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The servants of the Lord in the Dominican Republic know that religion has failed and is on Its way out, and the people of good-will from this nation are happy and glad to see it go; never again will it be able to muzzle and suppress the words of truth. The truth has taken hold and will grow by God’s grace to the day when the people of goodwill in the Dominican Republic will be ushered with other nations into God’s righteous New World; yes, happiness and gladness will be their reward.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The reconstruction work directed by Jehovah through his Son Christ Jesus is now sweeping over the earth. Even the good people in tiny countries are receiving their share of the blessings, and they will continue to receive them ,by the Lord’s grace. El Salvador is one of these small countries, in Central America. It is a country taken over wholly by the padres, who by sheer brutal force conquered the natives and compelled them to accept the Roman Catholic religion. However, now the message of the Kingdom has entered that land, and the Gilead graduates sent there have had excellent results in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. First they started in at the capital, San Salvador, and then others were sent to Santa Ana. Some of the happy moments experienced by the brethren are recorded here, as penned by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society, anxious to vigorously push the witness work, gradually increased the number of Gilead graduates until in June, 1946, the last four arriving brought the number up to fourteen. With the aid of these last four arriving it was possible to push further in the work, opening up the field in the second-largest city of the country, Santa Ana. The Society provided them with a commodious missionary home, as has been done elsewhere, thus making it easier for them to operate efficiently in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To illustrate how Jehovah’s active force is that which drives the work forward, the following is cited:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June 10, the four special pioneers above mentioned arrived in San Salvador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June 12, they had moved to Santa Ana and set up housekeeping and order in their new missionary home. (Several people had said that it was impossible to find a suitable house in Santa Ana, but through a clear provision of Jehovah the suitable home was found within one hour after the pioneers arrived in Santa Ana.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June 15, campaign literature arrived in the city and the campaign was on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">August 20, nine newly interested persons coming to the Spanish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, coming in for a special blessing in Jehovah’s glorious work of reconstruction, Jehovah’s witnesses of El Salvador and their friends and companions of good-will were favored by a personal visit by Brother Knorr and Brother Franz. What a feast! The new missionary home arrangement was set up. The work opened up in Santa Ana. A branch was established to facilitate the work. Service problems were cared for, counsel given to all the associated in general meeting, and the talk “Be Glad, Ye Nations” delivered on Sunday, May 5, in our Kingdom Hall to 66 persons assembled. Included in the audience was the Salvadorean minister of education. It was also during this blessed visit by Brother Knorr and Brother Franz that the San Salvador company reached their peak of publishers in the field for the entire year, 24 publishers. Last but not least, four persons of good-will were baptized during this visit, thus rounding out a full four days of feasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our visits to the people we find not all are deceived by the false teachings of the clergy here. One lady, a citizen of the United States, who lives here in El Salvador told a pioneer that in the States she had always been a Catholic, but since seeing the oppressive ways of the Catholic clergy over the people here and the way they meddle in politics, that w'as enough to open her eyes. An elderly retired telegraph operator who recently started reading the Society’s publications and now has a book study every week said, “How sad that I did not learn of this when I was a young man 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In July last, among the new publishers reporting was a married lady with three children who had only had a few visits made on her by the pioneer conducting a book study. One afternoon, without the pioneer’s knowing it, she started out witnessing in her neighborhood and placed three bound books and several booklets before coming home. The pioneer hadn’t arranged to take her out in the service up to that time because it appeared that she didn’t know enough about the truth; but the marvelous manner of Jehovah’s spirit over the “other sheep” surpasses all good things hoped for by Jehovah’s people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are now busy advertising in preparation for our three-day assembly to be held from September 20 to 22, featured by the public discourse “Prince of Peace”. All of Jehovah’s witnesses here look forward to this assembly with real joy, their appetites having been greatly sharpened by the arrival of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> giving us the report of the Cleveland Assembly. There were so many wonderful things reported therein that a person can hardly contain them all,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">but the wonderful things reported therein seemed to be topped with the report on the expansion of the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of this land have had their fill of war and trials. It is really a joy to see many of the people of this land now taking up the glad song and singing the praises of Jehovah. Here is another nation that has made great progress insofar as the preaching of the gospel is concerned. The people of good-will have heard and are taking their stand. During the years of war the “peacemakers” in Finland never relaxed from their task of talking the Kingdom, and the good seed they have sown is now being reaped. The report of the Branch servant is very interesting and some of the high lights are reprinted here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year just finished has been a very blessed one in the service of our dear Lord. Although there has been a good lot of all kinds of difficulties caused by the great war, yet the Kingdom work has steadily gone forward. That is even apparent from the fact that we have during the year reached 7 peak numbers as is shown from our Field Service Report. It is no wonder that the intention of the Devil is to stop the work and hinder it as much as possible. That was very easily seen in the case of our magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As our country suffered terribly from the war, so there has been a great shortage almost of all that we need for our living; and as paper and other wood products have been the chief means by which it has been possible to buy stuff from other countries, so there became a very great shortage of paper. The great adversary used that in order to deny the needed paper for our magazines. At that critical moment our dear Lord directed the matter so that the president of the Society visited our country, and, as it was arranged that the needed paper for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> would be paid with American dollars, the continuation of that magazine was guaranteed, and the Devil’s intention did not succeed, but his failure was still greater. We practically got the greatest part of the Finnish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscribers to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. So</span><span class="font4"> the increase of this important magazine was tremendous and the edition of some of the numbers went up even to 53,000. In this way the dear Lord turned the attack of the great adversary to a very big gain for the most important means in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very high In the north we have mountains to which people come to see the midnight sun. One of the most famous to which people are traveling from the whole of Finland is called Aavasaksa. The servant working in that district has sent us the following interesting report from that occasion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■‘We were 40 publishers gathered to Aavasaksa. Publishers from Oulu took with them an amplifier worked by accumulator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Placards on us, we started to climb the hill. We were all on tiptoe with glad expectation. Also the weather became the best possible as by order. When we were planning to carry our loud-speaker up to the hill, there came some policemen favorably disposed toward our activity, and they acted quickly in our behalf so that we could place our loudspeaker in a car, which, together with its own load, took it up to the hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our purpose was to deliver a talk by loud-speaker on tbe hill at 9 p.m. So the autoway winding to the hill was lined with placards advertising the lecture: ‘Thy Kingdom Come—When ?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By day, when we were fastening our placards on the top of the hill with the aid of local brethren, we were met with opposition. Play actors and money-catchers gathered on the hill would hinder our plan, fearing probable rivals in fishing mammon. However, all succeeded splendidly by the guiding and power of Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Until 9 p.m. there were gathered on the hill about 3,000 persons. We had tied the loud-speaker on the top of a pine growing on the highest place, and from there we began exactly at 9 p.m. after the Introduction and a musical piece to sound the lecture: ‘Thy Kingdom Come—When?’ and the audience listened attentively. When the lecture was concluded and the announcer said in the end: ‘Our esteemed audience!—Jehovah’s witnesses have come here to serve you, to give you the best: knowledge of Jehovah’s kingdom. Enter Into conversation with us, discuss with Jehovah's witnesses!’ So began 40 of Christ’s zealous followers, the education work lasting three hours among the steadily increasing crowd of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was ‘a sermon on the mount’. Overflowing with a desire and joy of giving we preached to the crowd of 4,000 people the glad tidings of ‘the Kingdom is at hand’ with our placards, magazines and literature and especially with our mouths. We were all rejoicing, feeling the ‘Lord’s joy’, as we had chance to nourish the spiritually starving ones with ‘the water of life’, the truth. Many admired openly our activity, organization and zeal. ‘We wish we could have such,’ they said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is sure that by that ‘sermon on the mount’ many ‘strangers’ came to see and know His 'glad nation’, which rejoicing, lifting its head, and singing the praises of Jehovah, is now marching away from Egypt—set at liberty by truth. We could report 40 publishers, 152 hours, listeners to the lecture about 3,000; in all about 4,000. Literature was placed : 5 books, 421 booklets, and 420 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Rejoicing at the privilege of service, we all send our glad greetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the Kingdom message has gone forcibly out in our country it has caused a good lot of opposition, especially from the side of religionists. Not only the religious papers have tried to stir up minds against the work we are privileged to do, but pastors and clergy have in their pulpits spoken against us. Especially a baptist preacher from Sweden has traveled all over our country holding meetings against Jehovah’s witnesses, urging people to drive away the witnesses from the doors and burn their books. But ip many cases the result has been just the opposite. In one town with a population of 36,000 we got in one and the same day to our three public meetings 4,000 listeners, and a brother wrote about the success, among other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Also here in Oulu, toward the end of last month, we became objects of tlie ‘enlightenment* by a pastor. . . . His purpose was, of course, to get Jehovah’s witnesses once for all out of the way with his lies and defamations. Did his appearance bring results?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have met many interested, who have been in his meetings. Generally we have got only positive experiences, and the interest in the truth has Increased after his visit. If only that pastor would come oftener to talk his clumsy lies, so it would help the ‘other sheep’ to get their eyes open sooner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the war a good lot of our brothers were put Into a certain prison called Sukeva, where they had to suffer in many various ways unkindliness. This summer one of our pioneers succeeded in arranging a very interesting occasion for witnessing in the same prison. The following is from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was near 1 p.m., when the loud-speaker was set up on the balcony of the third floor of the prison house. The prison doors were opened, and the prisoners began to flow Into the courtyard. The prison courtyard was surrounded by a high barbed-wire fence, within which the prisoners sat down, either sitting or lying on the grass. Immediately one could hear from the loud-speaker: ‘Attention! Attention! Good listeners! The occasion arranged by Jehovah’s witnesses is beginning. . . . ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The prisoners could first hear the lecture on ‘The Truth’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“You can’t guess how we felt It, solemn, especially when we thought how Jehovah’s witnesses had been 1 to 5 years ago in the same prison for the word of God. Now, by Jehovah’s mighty band, they were publishing the truth freely without any opposition. The number of listeners was estimated at about 350. We delivered six different lectures by phonograph. After each lecture we stressed the important points. The great majority of the prisoners heard attentively.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A thrilling incident was the trip of the president of the Society to our far-away country last December. After many years’ difficulties by the enemy efforts to wipe out the true worship of Jehovah by the totalitarian flood, tills visit was like a shower on the grass. It meant great impetus in the work which, by Jehovah’s great power, had gone through the many difficulties during the wartime. It was delightful for our friends gathered in different halls connected by wire to hear how their brethren in different parts of the earth had withstood bravely the attacks of the Devil during the war, and they drew much advantage by this occasion. Interest for the Watchtower School of Gilead proved to be astoundlngly great, and when one heard that the whole-time publishers on certain terms could be accepted into this school, many expressed their willingness to forsake everything and to travel to any place of the globe to publish the Kingdom, as it was outlined to be the main purpose of this schooling. For those working in the Society’s office it was satisfying and comforting to hear Scriptural answers to their many questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you hinted In your talk to the friends that you will perhaps come again and see us in summer 1947, we all were enthusiastic about this Information. Be assured we all are very keen to see you soon again among us to instruct us personally how to push on in the work, and we are all determined to do our best to promote the Kingdom activities.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are many problems to overcome in this country. The first major problem is the matter of securing the French government’s recognition of the Society and Jehovah’s witnesses, who are carrying on a good work. The Hierarchy has a strong hold on France, and for years she has tried to keep down the preaching of Bible truths. But in this she will be unsuccessful, by the Lord’s grace. Every effort is being made to have the Society properly recognized by the government, but in the meantime the good news goes forward and we find that there are 2,157 publishers for the Kingdom in France to compare with only a few hundred in prewar years. The people of France are in need of comfort. They love peace and are tired of war. There is a great work ahead, and the office in Paris, along with all the publishers, fully appreciates this. Such can be seen from the report made by the Society’s representative in Paris, parts of which are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">France, a country of forty million people, has always been standing under the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and for centuries was wholly dominated by her. Several times the freedom-loving people tried to get rid of this bondage; and especially during these last fifty years the Hierarchy has been held in certain limits so that In some instances democratic principles could get the upper hand. At this time, also, truth began to reach the country. It grew and spread out. But the Roman Catholic Hierarchy did not lose hope of recovering her old position of power, especially to restrain the gospel-preaching of God’s kingdom. At the beginning of World War II she again influenced the French government sufficiently to have the home secretary of that time cancel the work of the “Tour de Garde” and of the “Ttooins de Jehovah”. These societies and the companies in the country were dissolved, and the literature confiscated. During World War II the Hierarchy thought to reach her purpose with Hitler and Petain, and sit well again in the saddle and wholly overrule the country. But the Lord’s people, knowing their God, neither were influenced nor stopped by it. This people got organized according to the new conditions and went ahead dauntlessly with the proclamation under their glorious King, endured and overcame the difficulties of war; and as it ended the total number of publishers was much greater than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Nazi terror collapsed, their armies were expelled and Petain removed. All people breathed again, hoping that the “liberation” would bring them democratic freedom and ordered conditions. Also brethren in France thought that the new French government would quickly repeal the Society’s prohibition and make possible the true adoration of God. Personal interviews as well as two written petitions remained without positive answer. Soon we saw that political, reactionary and religious forces of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, again very well camouflaged, were operating here, canceling every progress toward true freedom. In spite of all our efforts our petitions remained in the “Police d’Etat” and so no progress was made. Each time we were told, “Your matter is being checked and we will soon give you the decision.” So we hoped for the coming visit of the president of the Watch Tower Society, Brother Knorr, to discuss with him the further steps to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s legal matter in France needed to be examined very closely. And so we rejoiced wholeheartedly as Brother Knorr could visit us twice in Paris, during November 1945; in fact very shortly, interrupting a transit travel through France. Our hope had been to have an assembly of the brethren of France in Paris during his visit. But after an accurate examination of the conditions and seeing that Brother Knorr had only succeeded In obtaining a transit visa for France, this was canceled and we had only on one evening an assembly of the Parisian brethren who had been quickly called together. This was a joyful and blessed hour for us all. During the whole time the necessary things were discussed in order to have further steps taken to have the Society acknowledged by the government, the Kingdom’s interests free again, represented with force and promoted. After an interview with a director of the American Embassy and the president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Brother Knorr asked a lawyer to check and handle our matter. So the short time of this visit in Paris worked to the best of the work’s interests in our country; we all got new courage and hope and learned to like Brother Knorr and esteem him as the Society’s president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before leaving us Brother Knorr made us a strange and unexpected promise: he would try to have the brethren in the U.S.A, send us clothing and linen. Quickly he had realized that we had a great want of these things here. All our clothing was old and worn-out and honest people could hardly afford to buy new things. This promised sending—8 tons of clothing for men, women and children—came in in 75 cases and has been distributed among the brethren. Numerous were those whose eyes became humid when holding their gifts in hand, and all wholeheartedly thank their American brethren for this true Christian gift. So, numerous brethren were better equipped for the gospelpreaching work during the coming winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the instructions Brother Knorr had given us during his visit, we continued to w<sup>r</sup>ork from house to house with the Bible. This method enabled us to repulse the attacks of the enemy and to bear the testimony courageously. Publishers work alone or two go together, and experiment with new ones, and also in groups of 4 to 6 publishers. All persons who are interested in the message of God’s Word are again visited with literature, with the purpose of making further back-calls and, if possible, having a book study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some districts publishers made particularly great efforts to overcome the lack of means of communication. Those who had good legs walked long distances, others again repaired their old bicycles, riding them 100 kilometers on Sunday to go in the service. A certain number took advantage of their vacation time to go In far-away rural districts and work there. During this time they dwelt in tents in the open air or found a resting place in farms on straw. So a company servant w’ent with 10 young brethren in the field on bicycles, dwelling in tents, working 440 hours, placing more than 800 books and booklets, bringing home more than 20 addresses of good-will people who had asked to remain in communication with them by means of letters. All rejoiced very much and so other brethren decided to spend their vacation time in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Numerous good-will persons who formerly heard of the truth or read a book write us now at our old address, expressing their ardent desire to enter into communication with us and receive literature. A 27-year-old miss wrote: “I already lost all hope of finding you, I could not remember your address. In my prayers I turned to the Lord and now I am so glad to be again in communication with you.” She became immediately a good publisher. A young man who stayed five years in Germany wrote: “Only the meaning of the contents of one of your books I read before the beginning of the war sustained me during my captivity. It is the truth. I would like to enter into communication with you, to receive further instructions.” In this manner numerous “other sheep” of the Lord became manifest (they stand alone scattered in the country), became good publishers, and some have already started little study companies. To the good-will people who had written us the office sent 1,442 books and booklets and 102 became regular </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> readers. We also receive letters from North and West Africa, and so keep in communication with brethren and friends in Alger, Dakar, Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, Dahomey, Camdroun, Brazzaville, Afrique Equatoriale, who now receive literature and Bible studies from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Increased activity meant also that during the year publishers had encounters with local police and gendarme forces at numerous times. Especially this spring the enemy, as we were dealing with the “Police d’Etat” to put aside our difficulties, was charging us in a special manner. In all parts of the country brethren were arrested while engaging in field service or making back-calls and Interrogated for hours. Five brethren in the North were charged with anti-military and anti-governmental propaganda. They had to come twice before the examining magistrate who reported to the Home Office in Paris. With the help of the town’s mayor, who knows our work and helped in this matter, all could be put in order. A reporter, interested in the truth, then wrote two articles in his newspaper, in which, in his overflowing zeal, he made an exact report concerning the companies in this district, place and time of study and service meetings, activity, organization with company servant, and close co-operation with the office in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came a further surprise, a young Polish sister went to work with a family near Paris. The householder opened secretly all letters and mail the sister received and made a detailed report of all to the police, which reported then to the “Police d’Etat” in Paris. So they learned about the addresses of numerous brethren, and also mine. Inspectors came to the homes of brethren; for myself, I had to come to the “Police d’Etat”. They suspected us of having started a secret organization under the name of “Theocratic Aid”. I could show to the two gentlemen who interrogated me that we are “witnesses of Jehovah” and willing to remain it, and to this end made a petition to the Home Office one and a half years ago and now are making steps to present another one to have our Society restored as “Witnesses of Jehovah”. So there was no need to start a secret organization. As “witness of Jehovah” each one of us has devoted himself to God, to obey him and his commands. In this fidelity of faith each one of us, in his responsibility before God, goes with his Bible from house to house to preach the Kingdom, and in this we encourage and support each other to remain faithful and persevere. To this end we do not need a secret organization, because each one acts for himself according to his own faith. The “Police d’Etat” acknowledged this statement and said they know that Jehovah’s witnesses do no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two brethren have been arrested in a place by gendarmes who phoned into the town to report to their officials. Following was the answer: “Jehovah’s witnesses with the Bible? Here we have numerous going from house to house in the town. Leave this people in peace; nothing can weaken or remove their faith; you are only losing time; let them go.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Lord caused his people to be glad during this ending service year. Under his protection his true ones could go ahead in blessed activity to the praise of the Lord’s name. But it can be said that all that has been done till now in France is but the beginning of the work. Only a little part of the total inhabitants have heard of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the political parties quarrel for the power in the country, they pay but little attention to the needs of the people and the sincere ones sigh and seek a way for deliverance. So it will be the task of the Lord’s people to organize for a great work all over the country that all the good-will people may receive the message and rejoice with his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The first year of coming forth from the concentration camps was a blessed year for our German brethren. The blessings came in the joy of preaching. These joys were theirs in spite of trials of hunger, lack of shelter and clothing, and opposition from the religious-political elements. Then, too, there have been some very kind people in Germany, people of goodwill, who have supported the brethren and have aided them in pushing forward the good work they are doing for the benefit of the German nation. When one reflects upon the years of horror Jehovah’s witnesses have gone through, one cannot help but admire the zeal and joy that radiate from these happy souls in Germany. With all the freshness and vigor of youth they are pushing forward to accomplish the most important work in all the world, preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”. Physically they do not have this vigor, but spiritually they are as strong as lions. After standing so firm under torture and extreme hardship year after year, they come forward as true, faithful ministers, doing good to their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil hates their activity with all his wicked heart and has called upon his chief earthly servant, the “evil servant” class, to bring forth opposition so as to stop the glorious message. Some holding high positions of service among the Lord’s people in Germany before 1933 turned traitor and served the Nazis so as to save their skin. Now they claimed to be Jehovah’s witnesses and even tried to seize the property of the Society by using some old canceled powers of attorney. But in all their wicked machinations they failed; their malicious efforts came to nought. Jehovah our God in heaven saw to it that his very own should be established firmly in Germany, and he cast aside the “evil servant” so they could not hinder the onward march of the Kingdom. How the evil ones fight righteousness ! And how they gnash their teeth against the lovers of peace! The truth shall prevail!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “peacemakers” in Germany, blessed of the Lord, are holding high the standard of the Kingdom. Their service, their devotion, their love for God and their neighbor, are very clearly set out in the report by the German Branch servant. The reader will feel the joy, vigor and strength of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany; and all will appreciate to the full the fight the German brethren are carrying on now, under great stress. God’s servants world-wide rejoice to be standing shoulder to shoulder with them, preaching in like manner clear on down to Armageddon, for “God is with us”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By Jehovah’s grace I can now compile the first annual report regarding the work in Germany after so many years, during which time no official report could be sent. How quickly, though, has all the affliction and sorrow of that time faded away! The reconstruction of the work which has indeed proceeded at a breathless pace, has drawn the hearts and minds of the brethren under its spell to such an extent that the ghastly specter of the Nazi tribunals and horror of the Gestapo cellars, the prisons and concentration camps have shriveled and dwindled to a minimum; and today we seldom recall these things to mind. It has all become a dream of the past, and only when the glorious deeds of Jehovah from those times arise in our memories to be passed from mouth to mouth among us in utterances of adoration, then too one of these darksome experiences will sometimes raise its somber head, but will very quickly disappear again in order to make room for the meditations that occupy our whole existence, and that is the continuation of the glorious work of vindication of our great God. How often have I and other brothers been asked whether we would not like to write a book of our experiences in the Nazi claws, but we can only respond with a smile and a shake of the head and say: “We haven’t one moment of time for it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little more than a year has passed now since we left the prisons and concentration camps in the May days of 1945. On the 2nd of June I arrived home, and in the last days of the same month I stood for the first time with a few brethren on the soil of our own property In Magdeburg, and surveyed our beloved ‘Biblehouse’. Desolate, badly damaged and completely plundered and robbed it stood there! All sorts of rough people had settled themselves in there and made it their own with the retreat of the German army, leaving it eventually in an indescribable condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the roomy apartment of a brother who had returned from prison with me (he had been sentenced to death, but had slipped from the hands of his executioners), we installed a temporary office for the purpose of encouraging all the brethren within reach to found their companies again and to commence the field service as soon as possible. One circumstance helped us in this endeavor and without doubt under the special leading of the Lord. A whole stream of brethren released from captivity and making their way homeward turned their steps to Magdeburg, guided there as by pure instinct, inspired by a feeling that something might be learned there as to their future activity. These brethren learned with joy of our efforts to reconstruct anew the organization and took with them literature produced under the Nazi regime, and a first letter of information to the brethren throughout the country together with our earnest exhortations. The Lord so led us that in this way several hundred companies very quickly learned of our activity in Magdeburg, and, spurred by this knowledge, went joyfully and resolutely to the work of reorganizing their meetings and soon too began to take up the field-service activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conditions in the country were nothing less than catastrophic. Postal communications were entirely suspended. It was pure risk to travel. It took me two days to cover the 120 kilometers from Leipzig to Magdeburg; for hours one stood on the footboard of the train, sat on the tender or hung from one of the buffers. Men, women and children died in desperation along the route. We were driven by the joy of serving Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Correspondence and information began to arrive telling us of the organizing of the companies in the whole country. Joyful and gripping communications reached the office in which the brethren, arrived at home in the meantime, poured forth the jubilation and enthusiasm evoked by the first assemblies of Jehovah’s faithful worshipers. They wrote of the overflowing joy and blessing of the Lord in the resumption of the house-to-house service. With what urgency and earnestness did these thousands of ex-coneentratlonists, men and women, now stand with the Bible in their hands before the doors of the people! Surrounded by the desolation and ruin of the bombed-out houses and whole city areas, confronted with the desperation and hopelessness In the hearts and minds of their hearers, with what force did the words of their testimonies penetrate into the ears and hearts of the hopeless and pitiable people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from the few old books and booklets which they had been able to save from the time of the robbings and plunderings of the Gestapo, the brethren had no literature; and so they went, and still do so today in part, with the Bible alone from house to house and published the dawn of the Theocratic Kingdom of Jehovah and the end of this old world. Much had been brought with them from the camps where the brethren under danger of death had reproduced </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other publications in mimeograph in considerable quantities. But now in various parts of the country with local authorization </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> and booklets were printed enabling the faithful Kingdom publishers to have something which they could lend to the people of good-will. The public lecture campaign was started throughout the whole country and there sprang up everywhere new companies of interested persons who wished to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After I had provided two faithful brothers and co-workers in the Magdeburg Bethel with the necessary powers, I traveled to Western Germany, there to establish the organization and to stimulate the brethren. We installed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">local office in Wiesbaden, a city in the American zone, for the western part of our country and I submitted the application for permission to print the publications of the Watch Tower Society with the American authorities. We compiled also a Memorial to the Military Government in which we stated that the Nazis had robbed us of our spacious and efficient printing plant and petitioned that by way of compensation one of the printing establishments confiscated from the Nazis be turned over for our use that we might again as formerly be in position to manufacture and distribute among the German people our beautiful books and booklets regarding the truth and the kingdom of God. We emphasized that just these Biblical truths were what the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">German people needed that their minds might be brought again into conformity with the principles of truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point we arrive at the time when a meeting with you, dear Brother Knorr, had been foreseen. You know the circumstances which arose to hinder this; but how, nevertheless, the Lord in his own way provided the opportunity that we might be able to give you a comprehensive report of the work in Germany and to receive your instructions for that which should be done. All these things were received with deep joy by the faithful collaborators and brethren and put into action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 13th January 1946 I could give the first radio broadcast over Radio Stuttgart. This discourse was entitled “The Meek Inherit the Earth”. Regular broadcasting facilities were granted and further lectures have been given in the meantime. Radio Munich followed quickly in its wake. On the 14th February I could speak for the first time over this station on the same subject. Here too we have been able to broadcast every fifth Sunday morning and many an effective witness has been sent out over the ether from here. When we consider that Munich is the stronghold of Catholicism in Bavaria, and additionally that in the past we have never had the opportunity of broadcasting, then this means a tremendous victory for the truth against the bulwark of religion in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 14th February the American Military Government handed me their official printing and publishing license. This meant that we were authorized to print and distribute all the publications of the Watch Toweb as published and sent out earth-wide from Brooklyn without preliminary censorship. Our joy knew no bounds! But things did not stop here 1 By means of a communication from a brother in Karlsruhe and the next day when visiting the Military Government in Wiesbaden, I learned that American officers were looking for a printing plant for the Watch Tower. And a few days later I could travel to Karlsruhe with several brothers and there take into commissariat administration a printing establishment confiscated from the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What had the Lord not done for us in these few short weeks! How powerfully had he driven his work forward 1 Often I thought of your words to me, dear Brother Knorr, that I must have patience even if it should be six or even twelve months until we should receive a license. Now only two months had passed, and what progress had been made!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now in this printing plant </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font4">are being published regularly, together with the leaflets and forms for the witness work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’</span><span class="font4"> has just come off the presses, and 100,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, ~Xe Nations”</span><span class="font4"> will be started Immediately. The joy and delight of the faithful publishers increases with every new means of witnessing that can be put into their hands, and with it the witness work in the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It cost many a struggle to obtain the release of our property in Magdeburg, all of which the brothers reported to me in Western Germany. Finally a particularly clear petition was submitted to the Russian Administration. Then one day the former mayor of Magdeburg was arrested and a new man took his place. This man received instructions from tlie Russian Commander to abandon the project “Hotel for Russians” and to return the property to the Watch Tower Society. When on the 10th March, after an interval of four months, I returned to Magdeburg the brethren had just moved in. The office in the town had been liquidated and the first rooms in our Bethel had been cleaned and prepared and were already occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now began a new race. A number of capable brothers, experts in the building trade who had been with us in concentration camp and had there carried out commendable work, were called to Magdeburg and the renovation and repair work on our property began. What was there not to be done? Anew the Lord poured wonder upon wonder out of his horn of plenty, and demonstrated his power and solicitude on our behalf. Think of all the building materials that had to be provided for this work! And where should they all be drawn from in this impoverished, plundered Germany? Today our Biblehouse stands beautiful as before, amidst the wreckage and ruins of the properties of our neighbors, who have not the courage to begin with the rebuilding of their habitations. They have often shaken their heads and expressed their amazement with undisguised admiration about the operations and transformations on the property of the Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our most precious gem in the Biblehouse is the Kingdom Hall. This was the former dining room, which also received the most damage. In the industrious hands of our brothers it has come forth anew and sparkles now in its adornment of new colors. Here on most evenings of the week the brethren and friends meet together in their assemblies, and once a week a public lecture is given. Amazed the Magdeburg citizens cross the threshold of our property and view the remarkable transformation to be seen here. They recognize that here the spirit and the particular provision of the lord have been at work and are thereby Strengthened in their faith in Jehovah and his commission entrusted to his anointed people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the montli of July applications were lodged for printing licenses in the British and French zones, while since the beginning of June such license applications are pending with the Russian Supreme Command and already half a year with the authorized Russian administration for Magdeburg, and we are confidently expectant that with the Lord’s help soon more than heretofore can be printed and published of this wonderful message. In the meantime the brethren in these zones are being provided regularly with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> thanks to certain local permissions to print and from the surplus publications printed in our establishment in Karlsruhe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A most outstanding event and a glorious victory for Theocratic sovereignty was the General Convention at Whitsun. Eleven different assemblies were arranged at the same time in different regions in Germany. The largest was held in Magdeburg. When we commenced our preparations we had no idea of what dimensions this convention would take on. Here the Lord visibly ‘enlarged the place of our tent’, and led and guided us to the smallest detail. The total attendance of this series of assemblies was almost 15,0001 And this in the face of disastrous transport and accommodation problems. In Magdeburg, the key city, 6,500 brethren gathered together, and in the ten other convention cities the attendance was as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The results of the convention in Magdeburg were magnificent. This assembly offered the Russian occupation army the best opportunity of learning to know us better. Because the Russians have never come into contact with Jehovah’s witnesses before, either in their own land or elsewhere, our religious opponents have had numerous opportunities of discrediting us with the Russians and have taken occasion to slander our work and thus lay heavy shackles upon our activity in the service of Jehovah. We have no complaint at all to make against the Russian military authorities and their relationship toward us and our activity, although we are often obliged to submit petitions on account of arrests of our publishers, local bans on our meetings and public lectures, and so on. These prohibitions, however, are nothing more than the fruits of insinuations and discriminations from the side of our well-known opponents, the religionist and Hierarchy elements. These are the same people who formerly used the Nazis to bring the cruelest persecutions over Jehovah’s witnesses, and to disrupt the work entrusted to them by the Lord. Today they take shelter behind the new political rulers and endeavor to use these again to stem the advance of the Theocratic forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We neglect no opportunity to specifically draw the attention of the authorities to these facts, and watch attentively how the Russian officers react with ever-growing interest and increased understanding for the situation. I am very confident, despite the sometimes right wearisome and strength-consuming work along this line, that we shall obtain still greater liberties for the true worship of God and the Theocratic service in the Russian zone. An especially capable brother is engaged full-time in this domain and enjoys rich blessing and visible success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only did this convention in Magdeburg make a great impression upon the military authorities, but also upon the German administrative authorities. And so the new mayor of Magdeburg visited us in the great auditorium. He was visibly stirred as he gazed down upon the singing multitude from the platform. As he took the proffered chair in my office, his first words to us were: “But you have a heart!” (By this he wanted to say </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">courage!)</span><span class="font4"> And that this assembly served to raise the respect of these gentlemen toward our work and our organization can be seen from the fact that about 14 days after the convention we received a letter from the City Administration Magdeburg stating that the street on which our property is situated, according to the decision of the city officials, should again be designated “Waehtturmstrasse” (Watchtower Street) as formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following can also be considered as an advance step in our fight. Immediately after our assembly a change was authorized in the designation of our organization in the Register of Associations which now reads: “Jehovah’s witnesses, International Bible Students Association, Inc., German Branch.” Thereby the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” comes to the forefront, whereas the designation “Bible Students Association” is only subsidiary thereto. Moreover, today the new authorities in Germany know us under our name “Jehovah’s witnesses” better than under any other title.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the number of public lectures held in this past service year, there being a total of 3,575 given, it is to be seen that this avenue of service has also been taken up with vigor. In the larger companies the Theocratic ministry course has been commenced; so we may expect that soon capable and qualified co-workers may be introduced into the public witness work out of the ranks of the younger generation and more recent company members. And this is very necessary In our country, for in the fight for the issue many qualified brothers lost their lives under the murder instruments of the Nazis. This cleavage in the wall of our organization is acutely felt, and we have ever grounds to pray the Lord to send more workers into the harvest field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many politically minded people are today associated with the religionists, and are uniting in their stand against us and Jehovah’s kingdom. Many of these politically Inclined people know us from the concentration camps and they greatly fear the influence of our activity upon their own comrades whose confidence in the politics of this transient world is visibly shrinking, and of whom more and more are appearing in our meetings, turning their attention to the truth of the Bible and the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. So it has now become a favorite method to deny us the qualification of “victim of Fascism” because Jehovah’s witnesses avoid co-operation in their political movements, keep away from the elections, and so on. They withdraw from us the supplementary food rations which, according to decree of the Antifascist Union, all ex-concen-trationists are entitled to, proving thereby how lightly they take the defense of democratic principles and liberties. These foolish people do not perceive that they are in the way to become the same tools of the Hierarchy and crooked stringpullers of world politics as the Nazis were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time I can give you a summary of our statistics of persecutions, an exact control of which is kept here in the office. This is not complete, however, as by the separation of the immense German territories to Poland and Czechoslovakia many brethren have not been embraced therein. Just in these last weeks, as I advised you in my last monthly report, hundreds of brethren have been ejected from Silesia and Sudetenland (Czechoslovakia) and have arrived in western provinces of Germany, where they must found a new homeland. These brethren will also give us their reports regarding that which was heaped upon them under the Nazi government; in this way the picture will be considerably supplemented. Nevertheless we have already a statement regarding 6,034 brethren, but you will gain a better idea from the attached data than I can tell you here. I have already mentioned that this list is incomplete; we are certain that our calculation of 10,000 Involved in this distressing experience is not overestimated. And it must be expected that we shall never be able to get absolutely correct figures along these lines, as a large number of the brothers and sisters are no more alive to report their experiences; and we are also unable to contact their relatives. Then again many of those who were formerly persecuted as “Bible Students” have today left our ranks and will have nothing more to do with us and the work of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is this collection of evidence that 6,000 faithful witnesses of the Lord have languished thirteen and a half thousand years in captivity not stirring? And now little bugbears out of the political camps of this world who were mostly held in prison for more criminal reasons than for the pursuance of an ideal, can deny us the qualification of “victims of Fascism”, while they attach to themselves the appendage of “fighters against Fascism”. They forget thereby that it is only too well known to us how many among them voluntarily offered themselves for war service just a few months before the victory over the Nazi regime, in order to be able to leave the concentration camp, to then lose their lives on the battlefields of the Rome-inspired German dictator in the ‘fight against the Red Army and the Democratic powers’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of all the adversities, the many obstacles and disturbances from the side of the enemy, the growth of the witness work in our land is most gratifying. When I report 4,507 baptismal candidates then this number is not complete, as at the beginning, before the whole organization was embraced in our country, many such services were not reported. The increase in the number of publishers is clearly to be seen in the rejHjrts month by month; during the last six months not less than 500 publishers swelled the ranks on an average each month, in order to have a share in the only true and right worship of Jehovah, our great and glorious Creator. Is there a power in heaven or on earth able to hinder this advance of the true worship of God now that the great Prince of Peace leads with sure hand the construction and introduction of the New World upon this globe? How powerful is the spirit which animates all those who are wholeheartedly devoted to Jehovah, who have consecrated themselves to the Creator of the New World to henceforth consume their lives in the interests of the Theocratic Kingdom and Jehovah’s holy name?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Germany there is extreme hunger and famine. The indescribable privation and lack of the most necessary things required to live, the undernourishment of the brethren, all this affects perceptibly the witness work. In larger companies an organized first-aid service has become indispensable to minister to brethren who during the studies and lectures very often faint from weakness. Many are lacking proper footwear and clothing. Nevertheless all share joyfully in the field service, and no one wishes to miss the privilege of demonstrating to the Lord his heart’s true devotion; rather die for The Theocracy than to be found disobedient or negligent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And so the brethren from Silesia and Czechoslovakia in their deplorable situation, completely impoverished and deprived of their goods, who have come into Germany in these last weeks, have experienced the care and visible blessing of the Lord. They addressed a letter to the office of the Society asking whether it would not be possible to do something for their collective settlement in a certain region of the country. There was absolutely no possibility of doing this. I encouraged them to trust wholly in the Lord, who, without doubt, would watch over their colonization In a special way. This too that they should willingly go to those places indicated by the authorities. We gave them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> “Comfort for the Dispersed”, which was not known at all to most of them, as they could not be adequately provided from Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now many of these evacuated brethren are writing to inform us of their new places of abode; they are joining up with companies or are founding new ones. They are being visited by the servant to the brethren, who to start with has transmitted the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants. </span><span class="font4">They have now been settled, as we notice, into such regions where till now few or no witnesses of the Lord are living, mostly in very black Catholic territories. Here they are now letting their light shine, winning new friends, and finding those of the “other sheep” and bringing them into relationship with God’s organization, that the life-giving spiritual food and joyful service for Jehovah and his kingdom may be their portion. These brethren too are extremely borne down by privation, lack of nourishment and clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will therefore be understood when the generous measures of relief by the Society, the costly gifts of clothing and provisions contributed by the Swiss brethren, have evoked inconceivable joy and gratitude among the needy ones. To be sure, this does not mean that all of these distressed brethren have been able to receive something. There are far too many for this, yet, nevertheless, a part of them have been effectively aided. A further large consignment of clothing from America is expected any day now, which will be a further effective means of relieving the distress among the Lord’s people. From the many letters received in the office It is to be seen how these gifts of love given by Jehovah’s witnesses for their fellow witnesses tighten and make more intimate the bonds of love among the family of God, and how the gratitude finds its expression in increased service and devoted worship of the good and glorious Creator, who himself Is the Giver of every good and perfect gift to his people. And so I wish to take this opportunity, dear Brother Knorr, of extending the heartfelt thanks of many hundred German brethren for the rich gifts of love and brotherly assistance in these days. May the Lord bountifully reward all the joyful givers! And may the knowledge that your recent visit to Europe has also had such blessed effects in this respect contribute to our joy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Brother Knorr, if you now through this first annual report regarding the activity in Germany have gained the sure conviction that the Lord holds his work in his own sure hand in our land as earth-wide, that he till now has blessed and helped us and that his spirit is operative in the brethren of German tongue towards unity and harmony in the same measure as In other lands, then our joy is overwhelming and complete. We are indeed a happy and blessed community I Why should we not be happy? Does not the Lord bestow upon us his favor? and has it not pleased him to distinguish us by visible evidence of his support and aid in our often superhuman fight? Are we not his letters too, written in a very peculiar way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the 171 special pioneer publishers who are engaged in the full-time service about 66 percent were in imprisonment with an average of 6 years per person. The German Bethel family, which, with the exception of the brothers called In temporarily for the repair work, comprises today 43 members, is unique in this respect. From these 43 brothers and sisters, 36 were in bondage with an average of 6J years per person. The 17 servants to the brethren have all together 135 years of the hardest imprisonment and testings behind them; this makes 8 years per head! All these look back and know that through Jehovah’s grace alone they have been brought out of the crucible alive. And they know and testify that their lives and all their strength in the truest sense of the word henceforth belong to the Lord Jehovah, who has preserved them for further earthly tasks. Him they serve and no human creature, and to him they are wholeheartedly devoted; they know no compromise with the old world and its rulers! In their name, dear Brother Knorr, I send you many heartfelt wishes and loving greetings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With great joy we look forward now to all the good news from Cleveland and with glad expectancy to those things which the Lord has to say to us. We shall learn of all these things in due time and then on the occasion of a series of general conventions throughout the country shall transmit this news to the brethren. What blessed prospects for these coming weeks I Truly the Lord lavishes upon his people a superabundance of his love and joy. Should not the ‘nations be made glad’ thereby?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">With this I will now close my report. May it convey to you our supreme joy and love to the Lord’s united people everywhere. With my whole heart I wish you Jehovah’s blessing, dear Brother Knorr; wisdom from above and the certain leading of our King in all matters pertaining to his work, that it may expand and accomplish ever more that which serves to the vindication and glorification of his holy name. May the Lord fill you with his spirit as you stretch forward unswervingly along the one true way upon which alone your mission can be fulfilled.

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the tremendous obstacles and restrictions our brethren in Greece must overcome, their hearts are grateful to the Lord for his loving-kindness. All the people in Greece live under a reign of a dictatorship, more severe now than ever before. The Greek government is under the influence of the Orthodox Greek Church, and the Orthodox Church has been a relentless foe of truth and the proclaimers of the Kingdom message. The church has used every political power possible to stop the progress of the message, and this has put the brethren in great danger and laid upon them many trials. The steps taken by the government because of religious pressure have caused cruel persecution to befall the servants of the Most High, and this reminds one of medieval conditions. Conditions in Greece during the past year have been the worst for Jehovah’s witnesses in that country in many a year. Despite this the publishers increased from 1,385 to an average of 1,915 per month, with a new peak in publishers of 2,022. It is hoped that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Society will be able to do something to relieve the suffering of these brethren. We know, however, that Jehovah has in mind the suffering of his people and will provide them with the necessary strength to endure all persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report of the Branch servant shows one how the lovers of peace and righteousness are not wanted in this old world. Excerpts from his report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as we came in contact with the office there and received the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions</span><span class="font4"> we started to organize according to the instructions as far as the circumstances permitted us. The result was that God’s people considerably increased under a systematic and intensive work of preaching the Kingdom all over the country. The new brethren were guided by their elder brethren in how to work from door to door with the printed message and how to make back-calls and book studies. The service meetings and the courses in Theocratic ministry were a great help for the purpose. The Kingdom message, already broadly preached during the last decades, resounded again more systematically and loudly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because or lack of books we pushed on the circulation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> from door to door and the Lord blessed us abundantly in this, because great interest was aroused. In order to be able to see the people often, the magazine was brought to their homes, and so, great opportunities were opened for discussion with the interested and for studies, and the circulation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> grew by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Persecution grew in intensity, especially since last April, and is the result of the slanders of the clergy. They accuse us as being Communists, anarchists, unpatriotic, traitors refusing to take arms for defense of the country, and urged the people not only to avoid us but to drive us out of their homes as pests, when we visit them with the message of the Kingdom. I mention a few of the numerous cases of persecution in Greece:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here in Greece the law of dictatorship under which we live forbids us to have any kind of meeting in public halls without permission of the Office of Religions, which it never intends to give us. So our meetings are held in private homes, where many times the organs of order break into and drag the brothers and sisters to the police station and thence to the court under the accusation of proselytism. Often brethren are arrested in the streets for either having In their pockets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or for being heard to mention the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of persecution was reached when two brethren were killed by beatings because they refused to make the sign of the cross and to kiss the Images.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the space of five months we have had over 442 publishers brought before the courts. Some 344 cases were tried in the Court of Common Pleas, of which 275 were dismissed and 66 brought adverse judgments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Forty cases in the Court of Appeals: 17 were dismissed, 9 were adverse, and 14 are pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seven cases in the Supreme Court of Greece: 1 dismissed and 6 are pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Six cases in the Martial Court: 2 were dismissed, 3 were against, and 1 is pending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Court of Admiralty, 1 case is pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the imprisonment to which the brethren are condemned, they are sentenced also to pay heavy fines. Until now the fines and other court expenses paid are summed to $4,000. This method of Satan has exhausted the brethren financially and hampers them in their work. This is why we fell back in the numbers of hours and in the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We sent a memorandum to the minister of public order but it availed nothing. Now we have made a Protest and Appeal to the Government, which we printed, and we will send it to all the officials in Greece: to the judges, police, and the deputies in the Congress. This is in addition to our appeal to the Congress to revoke the laws of dictatorship as against the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of all these efforts of Satan and his tools the work of preaching the gospel did not stop, but continues with a great fight. The Lord blesses his work and great interest is aroused, and the name of Jehovah is known among the people of good-will. We are, by the Lord’s grace, determined to go on to the end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We received the clothing sent by the brethren in America to their brethren In Greece, and we tried to do our best to conform to your advice to distribute this material equally, according to the needs of the brethren. We have received many letters from the brethren expressing their thanks to God and to the American friends for the timely gifts. The truth is that the brethren here were in sore need of the clothing; and with what you sent we were able to help 1,200 brothers, 1,700 sisters and 900 children, in 175 companies. We have a surplus of clothes for sisters, which we give away according to the needs presented. May the Lord bless his people who were so generous in their offerings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This little country has been given special attention during the past year. It is situated in Central America. For a number of years there have been a few publishers holding high the banner of truth, but what they needed was instruction and help from more mature brethren. By the Lord’s grace, it was possible to send down Gilead graduates. These special pioneers have set a fine example for the interested people of good-will and splendid increases have been made in the preaching of the gospel during the past year. When the president of the Society visited the country a Branch was organized and more brethren from Gilead were sent in. Now instead of only the 7 publishers reporting during the service year of 1945 approximately 50 have taken a stand for the truth and have spent some time witnessing for the Kingdom. From the Branch servant’s annual report the following excerpts are taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On May 10 Brother Knorr established the Branch in Guatemala and the missionary home arrangement was begun for the benefit of the special pioneers witnessing in this land. This visit by Brother Knorr and Brother Franz was a great stimulus to the brethren and people of good-will here; especially the discourse to 187 of these on the subject “Rejoice, Ye Nations”. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> in Spanish received a real welcome from the brethren. At the four public meetings In May we had an attendance of 312 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 9th of June we had our first baptism. Twelve persons symbolized their consecration. In July the Branch servant and his wife made a 5}-hour trip to San Antonio, Such. Ten publishers there wanted to be organized into a company. A public meeting was held and 22 persons attended. A baptismal talk was given to 5 persons who were anxious to be baptized. These 5 were later baptized in a river near by. During the visit the Branch servant’s wife showed the sisters how to witness from door to door and 6 book studies were started. At the last meeting with these brethren a young man that had attended all the meetings expressed his determination to go out in the service at the first opportunity; and, sure enough, in the next month, August, he was among those reporting. Two new publishers reported in the capital of Guatemala during this month, making a total of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">37</span><span class="font4"> publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every feature of the Kingdom work has been engaged in in Guatemala city, including the store-to-store magazine work. Beginning the last of July seven of the missionaries worked their territory for the first time to begin building up a magazine route. In a few blocks of the business section these seven publishers placed a total of 346 magazines and obtained 21 subscriptions. Much forethought was given as to how to introduce themselves and the magazines properly in Spanish, but on working the territory they found an introduction was hardly necessary, as the businessmen immediately recognized them as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> girls.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Haitians are a colored race of people, and they are as anxious to gain life as are all other individuals who love righteousness. As in all the islands of the Caribbean that have come under Spanish or French influence at some time, the Catholics have established themselves, oppressed the people and dragged them down into low poverty and ignorance. It is indeed a pleasure and a responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to carry the good message of the Kingdom to these people, to remove the refuge of lies, and to show them how they can be of the glad nations that are singing the praises of Jehovah. A Branch was established in Haiti so that the work might be better directed. The servant in charge sends in an interesting report, from which the following excerpts are taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The establishment of a branch on April 1, 1946, and the coming of five additional special pioneers has meant a definite increase in the Kingdom activity at Port-au-Prince and other outlying cities and villages. Since then the following places have received their first witness: l.e., Cap Haitien, the ancient French capital, which still has its old rustic French architecture and old world costumes as if it had been taken out of Europe and placed in Haiti. Many friendly people there would gladly contribute of the few gourdes and centimes that they had for literature and expressed concern about seeing the witnesses again. The same glad reception was accorded us at Croix des Bouquets, Kenskoff, Revierre Froide and Petion Ville.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The trip of Brother Knorr to Haiti and the setting up of a Branch office was the important thing for the progress of the work here, so that it would have a good foundation for the future. Now pioneers in need of supplies can be better served at the Branch than all individually communicating with Brooklyn. As to the success of the visit an interesting account of it may be found in the June 15, 1946, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the high lights of the year for the Haitians, and which might make it more favorable for gospel-preaching, is that its concordat with the Vatican has been more or less annulled. An article was introduced in the new constitution, putting the Roman Catholic Church on the same footing as any other sect or cult on this Island. From now on they will not have to pay for the questionable privilege of “concordat relations”. The church hates to lose her grip on this poor country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems the Protestant churches, through dabbling in politics, were instrumental in bringing this about, hoping thereby to make further gains for themselves, i.e., for the Protestant religions. But many honest Haitians do not like to see these religions attempting to influence politics to gain their own ends. And they can readily see in Jehovah’s witnesses a people who steadfastly mind their Father’s business of announcing the kingdom of God as Jesus did (Luke 2:49), as the only hope for distressed humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truth-hungry Haitians will put forth real effort to gain the truth that they have been denied for so long. Once when passing along the boundaries of my territory a man called me from the opposite side and inquired what my work was and why he hadn’t yet been visited. Being a man of some importance he was trying to obtain work in the youthful “UN organization” and declared it was his opinion of man’s real need now. The Kingdom, he said, was something we thought of only in our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back-calls stirred interest, then a book study in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> gave him real facts on man’s hope. Imagine my joy to have him joyfully declare after the fifth study, bolding </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom”</span><span class="font4"> book in his hand tightly, “This is man’s only hope, God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At another time, when making a back-call on a dentist who had taken </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> I was confronted by his dusky, beaming-eyed daughter with a dozen questions and the main points underlined in the first two chapters of the book. She had so many questions it was hard to answer them all; so I suggested a study. She wanted to know how much I charged for the studies. I said that they were free, as I am engaged in a free Bible-educational work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At our first study she read from a Bible for the first time in her life. She was so thrilled she copied the texts down in the margin of her book. Then she explained how she came to start reading the book her father had taken. One day the priest had refused her confession because her blouse sleeves were above the elbows rather than below. Then she started looking elsewhere for something better. Now she is glad she did, and I am glad to help her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Of course, not all are pleased when they hear the whole matter, and not all consider the road easy enough to the New World, but among all the inquiring masses there are some real, genuine good-will who are glad with His people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>HAWAIIAN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in the Hawaiian Islands had their difficulties during the war years. It was an American military outpost and everything was under military control. However, during the war years the publishers went right ahead with the preaching of the good news. They were a peaceful people, carrying a message of hope. Good results were obtained with this peaceful message during the war years. Now that hostilities are over and individuals in the islands are free to make expression we find that a new peak of publishers was reached, namely, 129. The Branch servant and his wife were invited to the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland; and they brought a good report, as well as a splendid delegation from the Hawaiian Islands. His annual report of the work done in the Hawaiian Islands is set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public meetings in 5 dialects and languages have been held with splendid results. Due to the Lord’s provision there are now brethren in the service able to deliver public addresses and to conduct meetings in English, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Ilocano, Tagalog, Bisayan, and also Hawaiian. The course in Theocratic ministry has been a great blessing, and has brought very good results in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a direct result of the publishing work, from November until May 38 persons took their stand for The Theocracy, and symbolized the fact by water immersion. The services are usually held outdoors and the immersion is done in the sea. On one such occasion a Bisayan-speaking man was baptized, and his wife, who is of Japanese ancestry, stood by watching with great interest. Then smiling broadly although fully clothed and with one child in her arms and another clutching her hand, she too walked into the water and indicated that she also wished to be immersed. This new sister and her husband are now happy together learning more about The Theocracy, and even though neither understands much of the other’s language or of English, they speak together in Hawaiian and study in their own languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The back-call studies averaged about 190 each month, and have been conducted in a total of eight languages and dialects, and they have helped to break down prejudice and Ignorance, and to bring a knowledge of the purpose of Jehovah. Usually the newly interested persons begin at once to tell others the good news and arrange for additional studies. Many interesting experiences are had by the publishers in connection with the back-call studies. At the time of the recent tidal wave, a Catholic woman whose daughter was drowned took her remains to the priest for blessing before burial. The priest refused to accept and bless the remains, saying the daughter had married a non-Catholic and, further, had not been married in the Catholic church. Shortly after when a pioneer sister called at the home it was easy to start a study, and now the former Catholic woman is rejoicing and coming to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Street-witnessing, too, is having the Lord’s blessing and this year more magazines than ever were placed. Some who are now pioneer witnesses were first met in street-witnessing. In one recent Instance, a chief petty officer obtained a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> from a witness, and was invited to the study at Kingdom Hall. As a result of this beginning, in four months’ time the man though still in uniform is out with others witnessing in the streets, rejoicing in the knowledge of The Theocracy, having taken his stand for earth’s new King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great event of the year, of course, for all the Lord’s people was the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly at Cleveland. When the first word of this reached Hawaii there arose great discussion, but, due to the long distance, it was feared that not many would be able to get there. By the Lord’s grace and provision, however, 22 persons from Hawaii were able to attend and to rejoice with others from every nation and kindred and tongue on the face of the earth. From Hawaii publishers of Hawaiian, Chinese, Filipino and Japanese ancestry attended, as well as others, and are now eager to return to Hawaii to tell others of the great happenings and good things learned at the Assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">And so, at the close of the service year, it is with sincere gratitude to Jehovah, the Giver of all good things through His Son and King, Christ Jesus, that the year’s work is recounted briefly. For the witness given and the testimony proclaimed, and for all the joys and pleasures of the year’s service, the publishers in Hawaii join in returning thanks to Jehovah. By his grace, the work of the year ahead is joyfully anticipated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This Central American country is a Spanish-speaking nation. Its climate is moderate in and around the mountains, while along the seacoasts it is torrid and hot. It has a population of 1,200,000 inhabitants, and very little work has been done in this territory to aid the people of good-will. Back in 1930-31 a zealous pioneer traveled through Central America and visited some of the large towns in the different countries. Good seed was sown. Some of these people have been found by the publishers since, and these lovers of righteousness rejoice to see an organization to look after their needs and to care for their spiritual welfare. The Gilead brethren are getting along well in Honduras, and the report by the Branch servant is quite interesting. Excerpts from his annual report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a publisher starts out into the field service in Tegucigalpa, he must be equipped with everything. It is a common occurrence to be walking along the cobblestone street and to be stopped by someone running up to you and asking, “Do you have that purple book that explains about the Bible?” or, “I want to subscribe for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya,&quot; </span><span class="font4">or, “When can I get a Bible from you?” Going from house to house here doesn’t mean talking to just one person at a home. Usually, if it is a woman, she will call in her neighbors and anyone that might be passing by, to hear the message. One publisher had 31 listeners to the phonograph at one door as a result of one lady doing some fast advertising herself after hearing the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We received a special blessing in the visit of the president and the vice-president of the Society to Honduras during the month of May. Brothers Knorr and Franz arranged to make a stop at the capital, Tegucigalpa, to be with the Gilead brethren for three days. A semi-public meeting was arranged for during their stay and all the back-call names were notified beforehand and invited to attend. Brother Knorr delivered the lecture “Be Glad, Ye Nations” with Brother Franz interpreting his words into Spanish. The audience of 57 listened attentively throughout the whole lecture, only a few leaving because of the barbs of truth cutting into religion exposing it as of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The entire visit of the president of the Society was one of joy and full of surprises for the pioneers. So that the work could progress and be taken care of more efficiently, a Branch organization was established in Honduras. This made it possible for pioneers or publishers in any part of the country to obtain literature and supplies much faster than having to wait until receiving them from the Brooklyn office. Correspondence could be carried on in the language of the country, and as companies would be organized more personal attention could be given them from the Branch headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly after the visit of these brethren, the Branch servant made a trip into the interior. His purpose was to get a general idea of living conditions in the different parts of the country into which more special pioneers would</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">likely be sent. Living on or near the coasts in Honduras means enduring more of the tropical heat, but the heat Is bearable and the vast amount of interest in these parts will even make it enjoyable. While he was working in the next-largest city of Honduras, San Pedro Sula, a earton of books was placed In less than three hours and eight subscriptions were obtained. One businessman exclaimed, “Ah, this is just what I have been looking for, a book to explain about the Bible.” The owner of one of the hotels in San Pedro Sula had received a book while visiting in Tegucigalpa. He had read it and marveled over the plain, simple truths that it opened up for him. He subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and made it clear that his home would be open for a book study anytime. The first few weeks of work in this city of 25,000 by Gilead graduates will mean more book studies than ten of them could take care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another little town about an hour’s drive from San Pedro Sula is also teeming with interest. It was here that several years ago a company had been formed by a transient pioneer. 'While the publishers had moved away or become inactive, a spark of interest had remained burning in the heart of one of the colored good-will. He had spread what he knew of the message among his personal friends, but because of lack of literature and knowledge of how to carry on back-calls and conduct book studies, there was nothing accomplished to any extent. This person of goodwill needed and wanted help. And now, by the Lord’s grace, he was to get it. He had been notified of the visit of the Branch servant to La Lima. Arrangements were made to have a public meeting in Spanish, and he had personally invited all that he came in contact with to attend. Despite the fact that there was rain before and all during the lecture, there were twenty-five good-will persons that attended. Each attendant was given a booklet at the end of the talk and he left the meeting-place rejoicing in the good news he had heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Organization instructions were introduced to the brother and his questions answered as to how to conduct the work. Calls were made on the most interested ones among his friends, and two book studies were started which he agreed to carry on. Before the visit was over, this good-will sheep was immersed and had made known his desire to put all his time in the witness work. His first mouth as a pioneer showed 146 books placed and many back-calls made. And now just two months after the visit to La Lima, the Branch office received a letter from this pioneer stating that the good-will are clamoring for another public lecture and that the good-will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font4"> a company organized in their town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The blessings and privileges of service in Honduras are almost too great to be contained in our hearts. One literally bubbles over with joy at seeing these sincere, meek ones associating themselves with the Lord’s people and being made glad. Knowing that Jehovah God is directing the work, we go forth, not in our own strength, but in the “strength and power of Jehovah”. His holy spirit is gathering his sheep together. Even as the command was given, ‘Give up; . . . Keep not back: bring my sons and daughters from the ends of the earth,’ even so it is done. We give thanks to Jehovah for the work done in Honduras!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is with real pleasure that the first annual report is submitted to Jehovah’s witnesses concerning the work in Hungary since the war. Many long years of imprisonment were endured by the faithful publishers of the Kingdom in this land. After the outbreak of World War II the religionists and their confederates set themselves to wipe out every vestige of gospelpreaching, and in the fall of 1942 the whole organization of Jehovah was, as they stated, “liquidated.” Nearly all the brethren were cast into prisons and concentration camps, and almost all the literature on hand was confiscated and burned. The report from the Branch servant in Hungary gives us some idea of what the brethren went through to maintain their faithfulness to Jehovah God and to stand for the principles of peace. It is impossible to publish all the Hungarian report, but sufficient is here set out to give you the true picture concerning conditions today as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From autumn 1942 till our liberation in April 1945, the few remaining interested ones continued the work without literature, by word of mouth and with the Bible in their hands. But although it was possible to hinder the organi-ized work of the Lord, it was not possible to stop the mouths of Jehovah’s people, and so during our imprisonment we grasped every opportunity of witnessing to our hope of Jehovah’s kingdom by his Anointed and to demonstrate our unchangeable devotion to him by word and by action, and we are now privileged to reap with joy the favorable results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then in the summer 1943, when, after many forms of torture, they had been unable to impel us to take up military service, all of us brothers up to 48 years of age were taken out of the various penitentiaries and carried off to Serbia to work in a big copper mine. Perhaps you can imagine all the means that were used to move us from oui’ convictions. In Serbia we had to work with 3,600 Jewish forced laborers in a mine in Bor. We also gave these men a good witness, but without visible results, however. When we later returned to Hungary on foot with these Jews, covering a distance of 450 kilometers [280 miles], over 90 percent of them either died on the way or were murdered —the SS often staged veritable blood-baths among them— whereas not one of us, by the wonderful grace and protection of Jehovah, lost our lives en route. Only two brothers died in accidents and one of sickness in the mine itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we returned to Hungary conditions improved for us, as we had many more opportunities of giving the witness, which, by the Lord’s grace, we always seized with great joy. In January 1945, for instance, we were led on foot in severest winter weather to a small town. Quarters were found for the Jews and the soldiers; we “jailbirds” were simply told to go and find shelter with the townspeople for ourselves, and report the next morning. We received this news with great satisfaction, for we foresaw that many opportunities of service would naturally come our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had many experiences during these years which were strengthening to us and our hearts overflow with gratitude to the Lord that he has led and protected us so marvelously. With all determination we want to continue the fight to Jehovah’s glory and to the honor of his Anointed, Christ Jesus. Liberated and at home once more, with joy we took up the witness work, but at first we had to accustom ourselves to this newly gained freedom in our country. Although the clergy and other religionists continue to undertake everything to stop the preaching of the gospel, the authorities have treated us really democratically till now. If now and again it happens that subordinate officials arrest individual brethren at the instance of the religionists, they have always been released at the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even the press, that formerly without regard to party (doubtless at the instigation of the clergy) wrote without exception disparagingly and abusively about Jehovah’s witnesses, write now quite impartially about us. The weekly paper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Demokracia,</span><span class="font4"> for instance, cites literally from a book by Martin Niemoller in which he writes about the Bible Students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another, namely, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hatadas</span><span class="font4"> (Progress), in the issue of Sth August 1946, publishes a splendid article in two columns entitled “The End of the World Is Coming” set in large capitals, by Egyed Petzeli, who had had an interview with me beforehand. Among other things he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses are not Jews. They are faithful Christians who do not belong to any denomination. They are undenominational although they proclaim the Word of God, both from the Old and the New Testament . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Who are these simple people who, according to the course of action indicated from America, give testimony for Jehovah and publish undenominationally the kingdom of Christ? . . . The churches want to honor God in coming together in their temples, but we, said Mr. Konrad, in going among the people and preaching the will of God as revealed in the Bible. The churches act in accordance with the dogmas and ceremonies as laid down by men, and instead of preaching the divine truths as recorded in the Bible they create doubts in the people’s minds regarding the existence of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With such, one can say, revolutionary opinions it is no wonder that Jehovah’s witnesses were persecuted with flame and fire under the former regime, and that the greatest Incentive to such persecution proceeded from the clergy. But when we reflect that Jehovah’s witnesses, strictly adhering to the teachings of the Bible, openly declined during the war to use all weapons of murder, we can imagine what unjust and cruel treatment these kindly disposed, humble people had to endure in the time when the wave of hatred forced our misguided land into total war. At the beginning they only wanted to prevail upon Jehovah’s witnesses to stop with the proclamation of their ‘treasonable’ doctrines and return to the mother church, but when this attempt miscarried, an organized pursuit by the institutions using the selected choice of tortures of Fascist terror bore down upon all those who were not willing to act against the dictates of their consciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When the government, said Mr. Konrad, banned in 1939 the activity of the so-called sects and denominations not recognized by the state, we continued to work in secret. In vain they dragged us to the police stations, military tribunals and to the prisons; in vain they filled the concentration camps with Jehovah’s witnesses. We did not cease in the proclamation of the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God. In the year 1942, then, when Hungary was also drawn into the war, the military machine bore down upon Jehovah’s witnesses with unrelenting violence. The detectives of the defense department traversed the country and arrested thousands of our fellow workers in the faith, and, when they could not force us to forsake our attitude ‘subversive to the Church and State’, we were turned over to the Special Court of the Chief of General Staff (the notorious hangman’s department Szombathelyis) which in ten districts rolled over the passive resistance, the unarmed front of Jehovah’s witnesses.” [He then describes how the trial was conducted and the sentence passed and how the witnesses were further treated, and then he continues : ]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses took a passive part in the resistance movement and have also suffered much from the Germans and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pfeilkreuzler</span><span class="font4"> [Hungarian Nazis] for the sake of their convictions. These unarmed preachers of the Word of God and Bible-reading revolutionaries do not want to change the world, for they firmly believe that the prophecies of the prophets and apostles will soon go into fulfillment and that ‘Armageddon’, the end of the world, is quite near. They do not fear this desolation; the world’s end does not fill them with dread because, as their journal, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> proclaims, ‘before them goes Jehovah God in the beauty of his King Christ Jesus, the Commander to the Peoples, and leads them with glorious victory into his New World.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We do not want to argue with them, he writes further, then this faith which endured sentences of death and forced labor in Bor so courageously, and which has helped them to emerge alive out of all this hell, is at least as strong evidence as unbelief. But, moreover, as Mr. Konrad said, they do not want to convert anyone; they only a-wait the kingdom of heaven and this they proclaim to those who have ears to hear and eyes to see. People from all denominations have joined their ranks, including Jews. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De jure </span><span class="font4">they are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">undenominational,</span><span class="font4"> but </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font4"> they are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christians. </span><span class="font4">They believe in the teachings of the Old and New Testaments, they baptize, bury and also partake of the Lord’s Memorial in their own simple way without temple and without church ceremonies ...” That which is not cited here is also excellent, but we do not wish to become too lengthy and must cease here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the present government officials know our movement, as they were with brethren in the various prisons and concentration camps. The present minister of the interior, a Communist professor, was a long time with the writer, together with other brothers in the same room, and we often had long and sober discussions together. For this reason the religionists cannot stir up the government officials against us so easily any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of this we have had many difficulties and hindrances this year. The brethren came out of bondage in rags and most arrived home to find their habitations had been plundered. In many cases the brethren did not have the most necessary garments to cover themselves properly for the service of the Most High. There would have been many more publishers in the service, especially in winter, if the brethren had had even the essential wearing apparel. The kind help of our Swiss brethren relieved us in this extremity to some extent. They sent us almost 3,000 kg. of very valuable clothing and other necessary articles, whereby the sisters in particular received very great aid in,order to be able to participate in the witness work fittingly clad. With very grateful hearts we express our thanks to the beloved Swiss brethren at this opportunity, and especially do we thank our great God Jehovah for his wonderful care and assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inflation which has worked chaos during the summer has been a great hindrance to our work also. The prices changed from moment to moment and often were doubled within an hour. We were therefore forced to reckon everything In food values. Our standard value was an egg. The brethren had to bring the cost of the literature each month from the farthest distances in food and provisions—eggs, cooking oil and fats, flour, and so on, in order then to take with them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other literature. These journeys were undertaken by the brethren under the worst possible conditions—in rain and frost traveling on the roofs of the trains, and not always without great danger. But after being so long deprived of the spiritual food during their long Imprisonment, the brethren valued this highly and were prepared to make every sacrifice for same. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And here in the office we had much work to do with the administration, storing, selling and converting these provisions into other values, and it required much time as well as very great circumspection and foresight to avoid depreciation and loss. We could often pay for the paper and the printer with food, but as a rule we fared better If we could sell these things and then pay with money. But it was necessary in this case to be on the alert that the money did not lose In value in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the present calendar year, however, we were successful in having 20,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font4"> printed In a worldly printing establishment, and a little later 20,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’.</span><span class="font4"> Recently an edition of 30,000 copies of the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples’’</span><span class="font4"> was also completed. In addition to these booklets we have had 2,000 copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> printed, and since February of this year </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Hungarian has appeared monthly in an edition of 2,000 copies. At the end of the preceding year we also ordered 50,000 copies of two booklets in Rumanian, but have till now only got 9,000 copies over the border.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak number of publishers for 1946 service year</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">115</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">837</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this country we have 115 (mostly small) organized companies. The brethren have placed their all at the disposal of Jehovah’s work and we desire to do everything in fullest unity to faithfully fulfill our obligations and privileges toward Jehovah and his King. With great joy we can report that the number of publishers is continually increasing. Ever and again new people of good-will are taking up the truth and with joy enter the ranks of Jehovah’s people and service. In this service year 382 persons have symbolized their consecration by water immersion, and mostly young people who quickly grasp the truth and promptly start in the witness work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The turmoil among the people in this religion-ridden country is hard to describe in a few paragraphs. It was announced that Britain proposed to hand over the rule of the country to its own people. Public affairs swiftly degenerated to a condition dangerously near anarchy. The religious communities jostled each other for power and finally came to blows, which ended in a terrible massacre in both Calcutta and Bombay. There were many strikes, communications were crippled, famine still stalks the nation, and discord rears its head on every side. Such are the conditions that Jehovah’s witnesses face in India in carrying forward the message of the Kingdom. Of her four hundred million people only a mere handful have heard the truth, and only a very few have given heed to it. However, the command is that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world”. There must be some Indians among the peoples of many religions and dialects that will be made glad with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us for a moment look at India as reported by the acting Branch servant. The Branch servant was asked to come to the Glad Nations Assembly and invited to attend the eighth class of Gilead. Parts of the report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole country seethes with upheaval and discontentment. Yet in the midst of this sea of humanity firmly stands a numerically insignificant body of people, unmoved by conditions, unshaken in their resolve to see the worship of Jehovah preached and established, bidding the nation to ‘be glad with his people’. It would seem to some as gross folly to Invite a people to rejoice in the midst of such circumstances ; yet surely on the face of the whole earth there exists no nation in greater need of such invitation! In the face of many difficulties these witnesses of Jehovah have faithfully tendered this Invitation during the past year, bearing the ‘sweet fragrance of the knowledge of him’: the savor of life to some; to others, as they hasten past to the supporting of their religious wars, the savor of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year opened with some bans still remaining upon individuals of Jehovah’s witnesses which prohibited their entry into specified towns. These are now removed. Yet other war restrictions remain; controlling what may be imported, what quantities of paper may be consumed in printing, and who may operate a printing press. You gave us permission to seek more suitable premises, but due to overcrowding nothing has yet been found. The government still denies us the right to operate the printing press that they released to us over a year ago. In spite of these things, however, some progress has been made by bringing the press materials up to Bombay and a more suitable press has been ordered and is expected to arrive shortly. Now the printing of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Malayalam has been resumed by our bringing Brother Vereghese up from Travan-core to Bombay for the composing, and getting a friendly outside firm to do the actual printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One thing that has hampered the progress of the brethren in Travancore considerably has been the lack of literature. For most of the war they had to copy their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">by hand. Acting upon your instructions attempts have been made to get a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font4"> a booklet, a bound book and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> printed in their vernacular. These jobs were put in hand with a local printer, but, while we obtained promises in plenty, nothing more substantial left his press for a long time. After long delay the booklet was delivered. At last the explanation was uncovered that the printers of Travancore are afraid to handle our work because the press that did our work before the war, and also the Society’s own press, were forced to close down; and they superstitiously reasoned that similar ills would result to them if they printed our literature. This religious objection has a strong smell of priestly Interference about it, yet it is possibly just a sample of their native superstition. Now, however, as reported above, the Society has its own compositor for Malayalam In Bombay, so part of the difficulty has been overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a pleasure to report that the young daughter of the Travancore depot servant (both are pure Indians) has enrolled as a pioneer. Persons familiar with the outlook of the women of India can appreciate how big a step she has taken, for she pioneers in more senses than one, setting an example that many older than she might wisely follow. Old Brother Joseph has reasons to be proud of his child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before concluding with Travancore and considering the next place, Calcutta, let me relate the experience of the man who did the Malayalam printing for the Society before the war. For about twenty years he had been doing this work, and many times received a witness, but regarded it as only another religion. Came the war and its restrictions and he was faced with the alternatives of either supporting corruption or else closing his business. He closed his business. Forced Into early retirement he decided to devote his efforts to trying to discover why the world is so evil and what may be the remedy. He found his answers in the very literature that he had been printing for so many years, and now he delights in a clear knowledge of the truth and counts the loss of his business as nothing in exchange for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now to Calcutta. A few years ago there was not a single company publisher in this vast city. Many times the pioneers had covered it with literature in the olden days with no apparent results. Then a single pair of company publishers by consistent witnessing now have a company of 28 publishers reporting high averages of hours and back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During a recent public meeting campaign in that city there suddenly appeared on lampposts and walls small posters reading: “Jehovah’s witnesses Not Wanted.” Just as suddenly there also appeared beneath them handbills advertising the next public meeting, the work of an enterprising pioneer. An anonymous phone call advised the witnesses to have police protection at the next lecture. This was not sought, but it was provided just the same—armed! One of Jehovah’s witnesses had brought along a good-will contact to hear the lecture, and, as both were in the armed police and had to report for duty immediately afterwards, they had come in full-dress uniform. Not a word, not a cough from the gang of Catholic youths present! An interesting side light to this incident was the sight of some Anglo-Indian young ladles, unknown to the company servant, pulling down all of the “not wanted” posters that they could reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Generally, the work in India has made small progress during the past years, possibly because of the unsettled state of the country, and also because of the super-religious outlook of the people. The small number of workers have worked loyally and hard, and that in spite of the most discouraging conditions. Their zeal was reflected in the two magazine campaigns that were held during the year, the first when the ban on the magazines was removed and the other in the world-wide campaign. In both campaigns the quotas set for all of British India were exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers and friends of India are grateful to Jehovah for granting the Branch servant the privilege of attending the advanced course at Gilead. These look forward to his return, confident that his training will contribute largely to the advancing of the work in India in the years to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is one thing that makes the outlook of the work in India brighter for the future. It is the prospect of a change in the attitude of the masses to these important matters. Up till now every ill in the country has been blamed upon the British </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">raj.</span><span class="font4"> Now that power has passed into the hands of their own nationals the people must learn what is common knowledge in democratic lands, namely, that man cannot rule himself perfectly, and that the best of systems and theories must fail in their execution. When India learns this lesson under her own government, as she now must do, frustration will drive the people to search for that perfection of government that can be found in The Theocracy alone. Yes, the prospects are brighter for the gospel-preachers of this land, and they are grateful to Jehovah for the inestimable privilege of witnessing to his kingdom, his King, and his own good name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">One pioneer and one company publisher are active on the island of Ceylon. These two publishers did very good work during the year, putting in 1,988 hours and distributing 785 books and booklets. Toward the close of the year five more persons became interested, and it is hoped that they will be numbered among the publishers in the next year’s report. It is the earnest desire of the publishers there to get a company started, and it is hoped that some day Gilead-trained brethren will be sent to Ceylon. There is plenty of work to do. If more workers can get started in this territory, and if the proper follow-ups are made on back-calls so that book studies are started, we feel sure the people of good-will will be properly taught and will praise Jehovah with the other nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942 those persons who wanted to get away from the Japanese scourge found refuge in India. The few of Jehovah's witnesses in the land of Burma traveled over mountain passes to gain refuge. By the Lord’s grace the work has been re-established in Burma. There is only a four-month report, but this shows that there are eight publishers again preaching the good news in this land. They devoted 1,053 hours to the field service, placing 680 books and booklets. Back-calls are being made on the interested persons, and 353 back-calls were successfully carried out in the four months of the last service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a joy to see that as soon as the Burmese brethren returned to their own country they began to organize for service. Our prayers ascend unto the Most High, to the end that his rich blessing may attend them as they too sing forth his praises and invite the people of that land to be glad and “praise Jehovah, all ye nations”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">After many years, 1946 was the first year in which the brethren in Italy were able to work in the interests of the Lord’s kingdom with some freedom. As soon as it was possible for some of the brethren in Italy to get in touch with the Brooklyn office after the war ended, they did so; and they received instructions and spiritual food so that they might carry on and begin reorganizing. Some brethren went down into Italy from Switzerland during the past year to assist in the work of reorganization; and very recently the Society was able to send a graduate from Gilead to Italy. We hope good progress will now be made in pushing forward with the preaching of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the war quite a few Italian prisoners were taken into other countries, and while there the gospel was preached to them. These persons took to the truth zealously and earnestly, have since returned to Italy and are now free. Immediately they looked up the Lord’s organization and associated with it. These young people are valued publishers, and it makes glad the hearts of all the brethren in Italy to see this youthful trend in the organization. It is our prayer that 1947 will be a marked year in the progress of the preaching of the gospel in this Catholic-ridden country. The report from the servant in charge is very interesting, and excerpts therefrom are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we have had the privilege of printing and distributing freely among the people in Italy the following booklets: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World, ‘The Meek Inherit the Earth,’ Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twenty thousand copies were printed of each booklet, making a total of 80,000. The total cost of printing was 200,000 lire, or about $888. The companies and isolated brethren have contributed toward the cost of printing this literature. Never in the past has there been in Italy such a movement for the cause of the gospel. Persecution has strengthened the faith of those who are to inherit salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Important events have taken place during the year: First: The visit of our president to Europe during which he also gave instructions regarding Italy. It was indeed a great pleasure and privilege to meet Brother Knorr and his secretary Brother Henschel in November, 1945. We were truly happy to learn on this occasion that a work shall also be accomplished in Italy; that well-instructed brethren would be sent to our country to take charge of same and to organize it as in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Second: The purchase of a house in Milan to serve as headquarters for the Italian Branch of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Third: The importation from America of 154 cartons of literature, containing 51,346 booklets and 5,762 bound books, as well as 99 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fourth event will be the arrival of the Gilead brethren for the management of the Branch. The hearts of all the brethren in Italy are turned toward this latter event with anxious expectation, as can be well understood, for we are all keenly desirous of improving our organization and to develop the preaching activity with all the means that the Lord has put at the disposal of his servants in this final phase, in order to gather the people of good-will as citizens of the new government of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Italian cities there are very few witnesses; the majority of the brethren live in small villages. The work in the cities is more difficult; it requires capable and experienced pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Till now we have been able to take advantage of freedom of press, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly without any difficulties, except the opposition of the clergy, which has manifested itself in various forms: by means of the Catholic press, warnings by the preachers from the pulpits, anonymous letters of threat, etc. The office too has had no difficulties except for an inquiry from the ministry of the interior regarding the application for importation of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Romagna, for instance, the clergy endeavor to oppose the witnesses of Jehovah as they do elsewhere, but they meet a people decided and adamant. Sometimes the priests have the arrogance to go from house to house immediately the brethren have been there, and demand that the booklet received be given to them. In some cases they have been successful, but often people answer that they first want to read and know the contents of the publication, and thus refuse to hand same over to the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother in Faenza writes that recently their company of publishers had been working Granarolo, a neighboring village. They were expected because the priests had told the people that Protestants would come and offer them bad literature, that they should not accept it, or, if they did, to burn it. Instead of this happening, our brethren were received enthusiastically in that village!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, there are whole regions where the ministers of Baal still enjoy their ancient prestige. In the province of Venice and in central and southern Italy this is particularly the case among the women. The men of the working class have generally turned to communism and socialism even in the southern part of the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Finally, we would render heartfelt thanks to our heavenly Father that he has opened the way that his Word may be proclaimed to the people of good-will, so that they may obtain everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the name of all the brethren in Italy I wish to express deep gratitude for all the Society is doing with a view to making the preaching of the gospel progress in our country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are about 1| million persons, mostly of the colored race, inhabiting the island of Jamaica. It is interesting to see the zeal of these people in carrying forward the truth, not only in the cities but also in the lanes and paths that go ’way back into the mountains. The people do not have much of this world’s goods, and they work very hard for a living. During the week the country folk gather together yams, mangoes, oranges, limes, bananas, grapefruit, etc., in their baskets and then start on a long walk to the city market. They carry their baskets either on their heads or on burros. Not much is received for their products, perhaps only a few shillings, but this remuneration keeps them going day in and day out. These people rejoice to hear the message of truth when it is brought to them, and they appreciate the Lord’s organization and are grateful to God for the opportunity of learning of his true purposes relative to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British government forbade the preaching of the gospel in this island for many years; now the ban has been rescinded. During the war years they had no literature and gradually the publishers stopped working, not wholly appreciating the need of making back-calls and carrying on the work as did the apostles in the early days. However, the majority of them continued to speak the truth, and the work got off to a magnificent start when the ban was lifted. The report of the present Branch servant is encouraging, excerpts from which are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came the joyful news! The ban was lifted! What few books the government had confiscated were released for distribution and in just a month or so practically all of them were placed with the truth-hungry people. Immediately an order was put through to Brooklyn for more. Jamaica had never had any of the new books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children, The New World, “The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font4"> except what few copies had come through by mail past the censors. Expectantly waiting for the new literature, the publishers Increased their zeal in the features of the work they could engage In, namely, back-calls and book studies and the public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another inspiring thing took place about the same time as the lifting of the ban. A Gilead graduate, Brother William E. Johnson, arrived to take up the servant to the brethren work. It was very much needed by the companies, for many of them had not the help of a visit by the servant to the brethren for almost two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A short time after that came the welcome announcement that the president of the Society was to make a visit to Jamaica while on his tour throughout the Caribbean part of the world. This caused great excitement and anticipation on the part of the rejoicing Kingdom publishers. To add to that, two more Gilead graduates were promised by the Society to come here to help. One brother was sent from Jamaica to Gilead to receive the special training there, and he was due to come back about the same time as the other brethren would be coming. The publishers’ long years of faithful work under the ban, all the while being practically cut off from headquarters, was being rewarded by much needed help coming to them to aid them In getting properly organized now to push on in the increased work due to the ban’s being lifted and the increasing number of good-will persons manifesting themselves and needing instruction and care from the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a refreshing time was had during the four days of the visit by the president and the vice-president! The Branch office was reorganized and arrangements were made in harmony with the new instructions. Due to the advanced age of Brother Banks, who was serving, a new Branch servant was appointed, one of the Gilead graduates. Brother Knorr gave much instruction concerning the work at the Branch office, stressing the need of helping the companies on the island to be informed as to how to be properly organized in the congregational studies, the back-call and book-study work, the public meeting activity, and, above all, the need of getting the pioneer work started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingston company, now three units, rapidly increased in number of publishers. One unit having a Gilead graduate as unit servant increased from 26 publishers in April to 67 In August. The whole three units now have 265 publishers reporting every month instead of 209 back in February. At present there are 126 companies on the island, with 1,001 publishers and 35 pioneers reporting in August, with more applications coming in for that privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Branch servant served a small company of five publishers in the country in May. There were so many people of good-will in the territory that with just two hand-printed signs telling of the talk that evening with the company, which were put up on the neighborhood stores, plus advertising by word of mouth during the day in the service, 100 persons attended and paid rapt attention as to who will survive Armageddon and how. Pioneers report splendid success in the public meetings. One brother reported an attendance of 300. In the country parts most of these public meetings are held outdoors, due to the heat’s making it much too uncomfortable to sit inside, and partly because of there being no buildings large enough in many of the small towns to accommodate the crowds. The people are generally curious and polite, and they are eager on the whole to hear the Word of the Lord. Many of them are fed up with the many confusing systems of religion that exist on the island but really are thankful when they hear of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy all confusion of religion, politics and commerce by bringing in his righteous New World. Many more of them are learning these truths too by means of back-calls and book studies. During the last six months the number of back-calls have doubled, the number reported for August is 4,207.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In April the Memorial celebration attendance was 1,700, which indicates the large number of people of good-will yet to consecrate themselves to Jehovah to do his will. Very few children are publishing at present, but it Is hoped that with the literature here now, and magazine street work to soon start, by Jehovah’s grace, and the parents taking up their responsibility to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, there will be many more youthful witnesses in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fourteen Jamaicans were blessed by having the privilege of attending the Cleveland convention, and many happy experiences were brought back; but everyone said that words are inadequate to describe the most blessed gathering of the Lord’s people ever held up to now. However, Jamaica is not to be without a convention of its own, because arrangements have been made for a four-day convention in October for the brethren to gather from all parts of the island for fellowship and instruction in the most glorious work of advertising the only hope for suffering humanity, the kingdom of God. The Jamaican government railway has kindly promised to reduce the fare to almost half for the benefit of the conventioners as they come to the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly in Kingston.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a real pleasure to be able to report that brethren in Japan are again free from prisons. The first thing they did was to start preaching the gospel. Indeed they were happy to learn that the brethren in the rest of the world had remained faithful, that the work had increased, and that the people of good-will were taking their stand for the Kingdom. The former Branch servant is still alive and has been released from prison. He rejoices in his privilege of now going forward in that land, singing the praises of the Most High. The Society is doing everything it possibly can under the present conditions to try to give assistance to the 60 brethren there; however, the country is under military control. As soon as regular channels are open for communication and the granting of assistance in a material way, we feel sure the American brethren will eome to their aid. For seven years nothing has been heard from Japan, and we did not know what happened to our brethren. We are thankful to the Lord for preserving these faithful servants, so that the witness work has a start again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The readers of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> will get some idea of what happened in Japan from 1939 onward by reading the following quotation from a letter of the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrest of all of Jehovah’s witnesses In Japan, Korea and Formosa was carried out simultaneously on June 21, 1939, by the Japanese government. As far back as 1931 it was noticed that the Japanese government would take action against Jehovah’s witnesses, because of the oppression that the government was bringing upon the people, and especially because of the action in Manchuria. In 1933 when Hitler seized Germany the first arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses was made in Japan. At that time many books, booklets and periodicals were confiscated. The pioneer brethren were thrown into jail in Japan and Korea. However, the witness work continued from that time onward, and a wide distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> in the Japanese language was made. The number of subscribers rapidly increased. A splendid witness was given in the few years following, through the distribution of publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One morning at 4: 45 the brethren in the Branch office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society were awakened by a knocking at the door. The office building was surrounded by more than a hundred armed police. Every corner of the building was searched carefully for arms, such as revolvers and swords, but they found none of these. However, they did take away more than twelve truckloads of books, pamphlets, periodicals and printing material. This was held by the Japanese police as “evidence” against the Lord’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twenty brethren and six children were immediately thrown into jail. Some were ill, and they were not given much better treatment. But a week later those who were sick were released. The condition of the jail into which the brethren were thrown was filthy, a hogpen as it were. Later it was learned that all of Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan, Korea and Formosa were arrested at the same time. Communications between the brethren were cut off, and nothing was known of what became of anyone until years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Branch servant was kicked, beaten and trodden on every day without any reason. All of his constitutional rights and privileges as a defendant were denied. The case of the Branch servant came to court The first decision sentenced him to twelve years in Jail. An appeal was taken and his sentence was reduced to ten years. When another appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the country It was flatly denied; and the Branch servant was taken to prison on September 17, 1943. He was released on October 9, 1945, by the military order of General MacArthur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever and wherever the opportunity presented itself, he gave good and strong testimony concerning God’s kingdom and his anointed King, Christ Jesus. A splendid witness was given to the Kingdom at the trial. The statements made were ignored and laughed at. However, through the years of suffering and trial it was possible to talk to some. When he was set free he was quite broken physically and financially. He started immediately to locate the missing brethren by the help of some friends. He learned through the newspaper that all of Jehovah’s witnesses were released on the same day, and he found a few of them. Up till now he has located more than thirty of the Lord’s faithful servants. All were in bad condition physically; however, they were rejoicing at the wonderful experiences they had and expressed appreciation for the Lord’s preservation. They are going forward praising the Lord in this nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is unnecessary to mention every brother’s experience. You must imagine how horrible it all was. Just for an example: A brother who refused to serve in the army because of his faith as a Christian was stripped naked, tied up by both arms on his back, laid face upward on a frozen concrete floor and forced to drink gallons of water through both his nose and mouth. He fainted and was left alone for several hours. As soon as he recovered his consciousness he had to repeat the same experience again and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure, many brethren have been killed in prison. No trace of them has been found even though many efforts have been put forward to find out what happened to them. Mrs. Akashi, my wife, was tortured to death in the women’s prison. She died on June 8, 1944. It has been reported to me that she was faithful until the very end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although we, Jehovah’s witnesses here in Japan, are weak physically we are strong spiritually, by the Lord’s grace. We are ready to start in our precious work for his name’s sake. There are more than thirty men and women who have come into the truth since my release. All we need now is literature to resume our work as quickly as possible. In the meantime we will continue to preach the gospel. Conditions in Japan are bad. It is hard to get materials, such as paper and printing supplies; but we can talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren here join with me in sending their best regards and Christian love to all of our brethren all over the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Marvelous strides have been made in the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom in Mexico during the past several years. An organization known as “La Torre del Vigia de Mexico, A.C.” was brought into being. In its every effort to educate the people it uses the Spanish translations of the Society’s literature. For years the Mexican people have been kept in ignorance with regard to reading and writing; the Catholics like to keep their subjects illiterate. However, Jehovah’s witnesses in that land are interested in knowing how to read and write, and they are desirous of teaching others how to read and write so that they may study God’s Word themselves. A real educational campaign has been carried on by La Torre del Vigia to this end. Many of the Mexican people who are trying to advance in knowledge are gaining information of the greatest importance, the good news contained in God’s Word. The Society is pleased that it can send educators to Mexico to assist the good people of that land to learn to read and write the true sayings of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year’s report, as furnished by the servant, is very interesting. He tells of the most important happenings in Mexico during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the entire year of 1945 the Mexican office had been pressing a court battle for the release of thirteen witnesses that had been arrested in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, for maintaining their integrity to the Kingdom and for refusing to compromise with the old world and its leaders. The 1946 service year had hardly gotten under way when the local court considered the case and then rendered a decision in accord with the dictates of the prejudiced religious officials, that is, finding the entire group of our brethren guilty of “social dissolution” and sentencing them to a good number of years in prison. The case was immediately appealed to the Supreme Court of the land and in January of 1946 this High Court reversed the lower court’s decision and ruled that the work being done by the Society in Mexico Is educational and very much “aboveboard”. The brethren In Nuevo Laredo were overjoyed at this evident favor of the Lord and were fired with zeal to participate in a campaign to cover the city with the latest Spanish publication, the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’.</span><span class="font4"> Also, as a result of this oppression on the part of the Devil’s gang, two of the brethren who had stood fast for their liberty received from the Lord made application for full-time service and were admitted by Brother Knorr into the Mexican Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1946 service year witnessed the completion of the new office and Bethel home, and amid great thanksgiving the family moved into its new, efficient, modern building, which act in itself is a sure token to the Devil’s organization that greater Theocratic action is surely Impending. The old Branch property is now being modernized and equipped to care for the instructors already here and for the ones sure to arrive in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1946 also saw another member of the Mexican Bethel family enter Gilead with the eighth class to receive advance training after a period of instruction at the Society’s offices in Brooklyn. This brother is the second Mexican brother to receive Gilead training; the first graduate is now putting to excellent use the training received at the school. He Is busy visiting and organizing the companies in Mexico and instructing the publishers in “every good work”. The special training has resulted in so much good that every worker in the Mexican office now has an earnest desire to attend Gilead and, inasmuch as a knowledge of the English language Is a primary requisite for entering the School, the brethren are all receiving an hour of study in English early each morning before their regular day’s work begins. The classes are conducted by a graduate of the first class of Gilead, and the progress being made is very satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four more special instructors, graduates of the Watchtower School of Gilead, were admitted into the country during the year, thus bringing the total number up to fourteen. Of these, two are engaged in full-time serving at the office, the other twelve dedicate all their time to the field service, and the results of their activities are indeed gratifying and demonstrate how the Lord has blessed their efforts. Although much time was lost by these special instructors due to sickness during the year, they were able to average 140.6 hours, 59.0 back-calls and 12.6 book studies per month. A report of their year's activities is set out below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Due to indirect enemy action the Society’s small printing plant located at the Mexican office was recorded by the tax collector as a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">commercial</span><span class="font4"> enterprise and was then billed for several years’ back-taxes. Even though proof was submitted to show that the press is used exclusively for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">noncommercial</span><span class="font4"> purposes, such as for printing the Society’s office and field service forms, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants,</span><span class="font4"> etc., etc., the board’s decision was against us. When all our hopes for exemption had faded and the Branch had expended its last effort a seeming miracle occurred; we received notice of exemption from the higher officials without any explanation whatsoever except to say that the press was exempt from any taxes. This may or may not have a connection with the fact that a short time before this a government inspector attended one of the meetings of tlie Mexico City Unit while a class to teach reading and writing was in progress. After the meeting the inspector was much enthused over the fact that we are carrying on such a good educational work without charging the people a cent. He went so far as to get the government to issue a certificate showing that the Society’s office in Mexico (La Torre del Vigia) was conducting an educational center to teach reading and writing. Be it as it may, we are certainly thankful to the Prime Mover of all good things for his part in getting the printing plant tax-exempted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February the president’s office notified us that the Society’s president and the vice-president, Brothers N. H. Knorr and F. W. Franz, expected to visit Mexico sometime in May in the interests of the Kingdom service. Preparations went ahead immediately for a three-day convention to be held in Mexico city. The Arena Mexico was gotten for the meetings. On the night of May 14 Brothers Knorr and Franz arrived at the Mexico city airport and, for the members of the Mexico Bethel family and the special Gilead instructors, the convention started right then. During their stay in Mexico “el presidente” and “el vice-presidente” stayed at the new Branch building and imparted much needed instructions and advice to the members of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great international convention held at Cleveland was of special Interest for the witnesses in Mexico and all looked forward to the special representative’s visit and the Mexican delegates’ return so that the “Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly in Mexico” might begin. This Assembly w<sup>T</sup>as announced for August 30, 31 and September 1, 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convention was a fitting finale to an active service year. Brother T. H. Siebenlist delivered the main lectures and presented the surprise of the year for the Mexican witnesses when he held aloft a copy of the new Spanish Concordance published by the Society. The brethren were overjoyed to think that now they would have an Instrument with which to wield better than ever the “sword of the spirit”. His explanation of the new servant to the brethren work soon to be Inaugurated in Mexico made the witnesses shout for joy. Sunday morning, September 1, a further surprise was announced in the form of the new magazine which will-take the place of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> that is, the Spanish edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> The public lecture, to which only the people of good-will were invited, was a huge success. 1,202 persons attended and applauded Brother Siebenlist more than a score of times while he delivered the lecture “The Prince of Peace”. The following week-ends conventions were held in Monterrey and Mazatlin, thus winding up a very enjoyable year of service.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>THE NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country to most people is better known as “Holland”. Approximately eleven million people dwell in this land. A grave responsibility falls upon Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the earth to carry the good news of the Kingdom to the people. The inhabitants of this land, too, must join in fulfilling: “Praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” Last year the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font5">brought to your attention the things our brethren in the Netherlands endured during the war. The war is now over as far as they are concerned, but their hardships have not ended. Amidst these hardships the faithful servants of the Most High have moved forward under the Lord’s direction and have received his blessing. The average number of publishers in the field a year ago was 2,117, and now it has increased to 3,559. Remarkable indeed! The peak of publishers, reached in June, was 3,936. The “other sheep” are listening to the message of the truth and are then taking up the glad song of praising Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report by the Gilead-graduated Branch servant, newly appointed during the last year, is very interesting and reveals very clearly Catholic Action as practiced in the Netherlands. Excerpts from his report tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opening of the new service year 1945-46 was marked by the thrilling event of our first convention since the year 1939, which convention was held in The Hague. At a time of great financial difficulties, when hardly any money was In circulation and during a period when a great food shortage existed, it could only be the leading of the Lord that under such conditions 6,000 of the brethren and persons of good-will could gather together In assembly. The convention was very strengthening to the Lord’s servants who had faithfully endured many terrible ordeals during the war years and it was also a great stimulus to the persons of good-will who had abandoned the ways of the sick and dying old world and were finding the needed hope and comfort in the Theocratic organization of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The problems of the reconstruction and the expansion of Jehovah’s “strange work” here in the Netherlands have not been easy ones. The end of the war found us with our money blocked in the bank by reason of measures the government had to take because of inflation and fears of the black market. Without the necessary money we could not buy-the things we needed. Paper has been scarce and high in price and many have been our problems along printing lines. But in spite of these difficulties, the organization continued to grow in the Netherlands and this caused more problems in Theocratically caring for the increase that was taking place and was yet to come. Not having had good contact with the Lord’s visible organization on the outside of the Netherlands for quite a number of years, we felt sadly lacking in knowing how to properly operate our office as well as taking good care of the work in the field. Then, too, we were also cramped in our old headquarters office, and this caused more difficulties. Many of the brethren connected with the office lived in different parts of Amsterdam, in homes of the various friends, and this made organization difficult. These and many other difficulties stared us in the face and, though we trusted that the Lord would help us in our time of need, we did not know how that needed help would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was during this period of stress that we were greatly strengthened by the visit of the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, and his traveling companion, Brother Henschel. During the trip they were making through a part of Europe to see what needed to be done to help the reconstruction of the Lord’s work, particularly in the war-torn countries, they stopped in at Amsterdam for a few days to see what could be done to assist the Branch organization in the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr’s advice on what to do about our present difficulties was very helpful and encouraging to us. We were informed that arrangements were already under way to send a brother graduate of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead here to help us in the building up of the Theocratic organization in the Netherlands, and this news greatly rejoiced us. Brother Knorr also promised help of a material nature, stating that arrangements would be made to send relief food parcels from Denmark to Amsterdam for distribution to needy brethren throughout the Netherlands; as soon as possible the Hollandish edition of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> would be printed and shipped to us, besides other shipments of literature and paper; we were also informed that clothing was being gathered by our American brethren to ship to the Netherlands so that our brethren here might be more comfortably clothed in preaching glad tidings to the meek. We were overjoyed and very thankful for these promised provisions and the very thought of such promised aid and material assistance was very strengthening to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">True to his word, the aid and material assistance promised by Brother Knorr arrived in the course of time. The brother from Gilead arrived In our midst in the middle of January and since his arrival many of our problems in organization have been made lighter and we have since then made many strides in bringing the Theocratic organization in line with service instructions the world over. To date we have received 137 food parcels from Denmark, which packages were joyously received and made good use of. Thousands upon thousands of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> in Hollandish have arrived from America and these were welcomed with open arms. Then, on top of all this, thirty tons of good, warm, serviceable clothing eventually reached Amsterdam and was soon distributed among the needy brethren. Our hearts were filled with thanks to the brim to the Most High, heavenly Father, Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, for his many unspeakable gifts upon his children here in the Netherlands. True appreciation for such marvelous gifts can be shown only in increased service activities and devotion to Theocratic service, and this devotion we are resolved to give in the days to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further material assistance is seen in the new home that Brother Knorr made arrangements for us to buy in the name of the American Society. Beautiful in structure, well built with roomy office and living rooms and located In one of the most reputable neighborhoods in Amsterdam, It Is a home well befitting the headquarters organization of the Lord here in the Netherlands. Bringing the Bethel family together under one roof has greatly lightened some of the problems we have had in organization. All of these aforementioned gifts of spiritual and material nature have done much to help us to plan and to put into operation the steps necessary to bring about a real reconstruction of the Lord’s work in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Devil, to be sure, has not been asleep while all these plans for reconstruction have been going on. Ever alert and always trying to do whatever possible to hinder the foretold increase of the thousands of persons of good-will lining themselves up with the Lord’s visible organization, he introduced a new “scare” to the Netherlands folk this year. Suddenly, in certain sections of this small country, “spooks” began to appear at night, clad in white sheets, unexpectedly jumping from behind trees, appearing without warning in the middle of the road and frightening timid passers-by with the words “Bent U bereid te sterven?” (“Are you ready to die?”) The name of Jehovah’s witnesses was then mentioned by these mischief-makers In order that their victims would think that the witnesses were the perpetrators of such acts. Some persons were even called up on the telephone and asked the same question and were also given the impression that Jehovah’s witnesses were responsible for such calls. Newspapers then began to pick up the stories and to circulate them throughout the Netherlands to the point where the name of Jehovah was being reproached and ridicule cast upon his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It did not take long for such happenings and stories to reach our ears, and, because of the effects such devilish work was causing, legal action was taken to bring the perpetrators of such misdeeds to justice. The matter was brought to the attention of the police and the press and immediate action was forthcoming. Every investigation made, where the perpetrators of such acts were caught (and plenty of them were caught), proved that Jehovah’s witnesses had nothing whatsoever to do with such unlawful disturbances but that the real instigators of these misdeeds were youngsters or older persons motivated by someone else to carry on their mischief-making. One by one the different newspapers retracted the reports they had made against Jehovah’s witnesses, apologizing for the wrong reports made. (It is noteworthy here to mention that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not one</span><span class="font4"> Catholic newspaper retracted any of its statements against the Witnesses.) Knowing of the courageous stand taken by Jehovah’s witnesses during the war with the Nazis, observing the results of police investigations made, many newspapers not only apologized for the error they had made in linking up Jehovah’s witnesses with the “phantom” hoax but through their publications even gave a hint as to who the real instigators of the trouble might be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection It is interesting to note the comment made by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De Waarheid,</span><span class="font4"> March 27, 1946 (Edition for the Ijsselstreek) : “Ninety percent of sane-thinking persons know that the acts of cowardice do not come from the true Jehovah’s witnesses but from those who hate the witnesses of Jehovah ... By the foregoing we want our readers to realize, if they don’t realize such already, that there is something else behind this affair, namely, a great power which wants to instigate the public against the true Jehovah’s witnesses. They are the same powers as in the days of Christ and now they try to prevent the people of goodwill from examining the message of truth about God’s purposes on the basis of the Bible. The true Jehovah’s witnesses do not come In the nighttime; they come in the daytime and offer the people Bible literature.” Many were the interesting retractions made by the various newspapers in connection with their misinformation about Jehovah’s witnesses, and the result has been not only a clearing away of the slander brought upon the Lord’s people, but that many persons of good-will have had their eyes opened to the truth of the matter and have taken their stand for Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There remains no question of doubt in our mind as to who the promulgators of the “phantom” hoax were. We remember quite well that a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font4"> newspaper was the first to begin the circulation of such “ghost” stories; we do not forget that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not one single Catholic newspaper</span><span class="font4"> ever published a retraction of the lies they published about Jehovah’s witnesses in this connection; and, most important of all, we keep quite well in mind the words of one of the Hierarchy’s radio priests in this country, who during one of his radio talks brought to light the age-abiding hatred that the Hierarchy has for that which is truth and righteous. After letting out some very painful howls about the piercing truths published in the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> and a choice article from an issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">magazine, he continued his mad tirade with the following threat against Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . and I can assure the ladles and gentlemen of the Watch Tower that we are firmly resolved to resist now and that we shall not stand this hypocritical mischief-making any longer. And if this vileness still goes on, we shall try to persuade our Catholic Youth organizations, Catholic students, members of Catholic Action, Catholic Farmer’s unions, middle-class organizations, working-class organizations ... to pelt the government with petitions, motions and protest assemblies until these hypocritical brawlers are silenced and the paper for reviling is kept from them . . . ” (Radio talk of “Pater” Henri de Greeve, November 11, 1945, radio station Hilversum)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these threatening words we have all the evidence we need to identify who the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font4"> instigators and perpetrators of the “phantom” hoax were, because it was not long after this threat was made that the organized attempt to besmirch the name of Jehovah’s witnesses began. We also have plenty of other evidence on file showing the guilt of the Hierarchy’s stooges in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new weapon that Satan has tried to use through his earthly representatives to hinder the Lord’s organization from growing in numbers not only has failed in its purpose but has acted as a boomerang; instead of the Lord’s organization diminishing in numbers it has actually broken forth in greater numbers than ever before. Many are the persons now associated with the Lord’s organization that previous to the “spook” scare knew little or nothing of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meetings are doing a wonderful work in helping many persons of good-will to take their stand for The Theocracy. This work was immediately organized after the war years, but until the new instructions were introduced it made rather slow headway. Now, in spite of problems of lack of suitable halls in many places, high costs of renting, opposition, etc., the number of meetings has steadily risen until we have exactly 100 public meetings going at the present time. One unit in Rotterdam had as high as 400 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">new interest</span><span class="font4"> at one of their public meetings, while another company reports 30 back-calls as the result of one public lecture.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s “strange work’’ here in the Netherlands for the past service year gives us much cause for rejoicing. Instead of hindering the work and discouraging the Lord's people, persecution has only tended to strengthen the faith of the brethren and make a tighter knot in the bonds of our love for Jehovah and for his everlasting Theocracy by Christ Jesus. No weapon that has ever been formed against the Lord’s faithful servants has ever prospered against them and we know that no weapon that shall be formed against them in the coming postwar years can hold back the mighty increase of the Lord’s dearly beloved “other sheep” from coming into the fold of God’s Theocratic organization. We remember the encouraging words of truth as expressed in the English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> January 15, 1946, issue, wherein it is written: “Let us remember always that Jehovah’s right arm of Almighty power Is active and is moving for the everlasting deliverance of his devoted, trusting people. If that arm of everlasting strength stretches forth, pointing us onward In his service, no pathway can remain blocked before us.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The island in the northern latitude known as Newfoundland should be included as one of the nations praising Jehovah. It has been the good pleasure of the Society to organize a Branch office during the year, and to send Gilead graduates into that country to help those who have faith in God’s kingdom. The number of publishers increased from 28 to 38 in average during the year, reaching a new peak of 60. This shows that the people of good-will are determined to carry the message to the interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign the brethren set a quota of 500 subscriptions, which was very high in their eyes; but Jehovah blessed them and at the close of April they had passed the 500 mark, and before the year ended there were 794 readers of the Society’s magazines in Newfoundland. This affords the publishers splendid opportunities for back-calls. The Society’s boat “Hope” has done an excellent work along the coast, visiting the fishermen and bringing the people not only spiritual help but assistance in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">many other ways. Newfoundland sent a good delegation of representatives to the Glad Nations Assembly in Cleveland; and they arranged to have their own local assembly in order that all there might attend. Two Newfoundlanders are students in the eighth class at Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the ban was removed in Newfoundland things have been happening as far as the preaching of the gospel is concerned. Activity never ceased in that land even though a ban restricted the Lord’s people, forbidding them to import the literature for use in the educational work. Now, with ample supplies, good seed is planted, and, by the Lord’s grace, the brethren in Newfoundland will keep it watered and look to God to bring about the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gilead Branch servant, appointed this year, tells us of happenings there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With a ban no longer imposed upon the Kingdom literature, and with over seventy-five thousand pieces on hand at the beginning of the year to be distributed, everything portended an eventful service year for Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland. It has been just that. The verity of this is vindicated as we go back and review the happenings and events of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second and third months of the service year brought much joy to the few Newfoundland Theocratic ambassadors. Why? The long anticipated arrival of nine special pioneers, who had been trained at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, became a reality. Two arrived in October and proceeded to their assignment in Cornerbrook (the second-largest city in Newfoundland). Seven others arrived at St. John’s the middle of November. There was much work for these brethren to do upon arrival. First of all, there was the Branch office procedure to reorganize and harmonize with that of the Brooklyn office. The two companies where the Gilead brethren were assigned were more or less disorganized and it was seen that the brethren needed much training concerning Theocratic organization instructions. Only two or three were reporting field service in St. John’s, and the same was true of Cornerbrook. During the next few months the number of publishers in the St. John’s company grew steadily from three to a high peak of sixteen in May and with a total of thirty-one reporting some service sometime during the year. The number of publishers in Cornerbrook grew from two to a peak of nine. How manifest is the Lord’s blessing upon the educational work done by these Gilead-trained ministers! Their presence has been a healthy influence to the other publishers throughout the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In March a Gilead-trained servant to the brethren was sent to visit the eight Newfoundland companies. Getting to some of the companies in Newfoundland is no easy task. In order to get to the first company on the route, the servant to the brethren had to ride 358 miles by rail and from that point walk another 33 miles over rough and wild country. The results obtained, however, were worth the efforts put forth and the hardships endured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet Isaiah, under inspiration, said concerning the reign of Christ Jesus, “of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” Thus is foretold the great expansion of the Lord’s organization until it fills the whole earth. To meet the surging tide of increased Theocratic activity in Newfoundland, it was seen that larger and more adequate headquarters for the Branch at St. John’s must be sought. Under the direction and sanction of the Society’s president, Brother Knorr, a new place was located and arrangements made to purchase the same. This new location will provide adequate room for the housing of the Branch family, for the Branch oflice and for the storing of literature. Another building on the property is being converted into a commodious Kingdom Hall for the use of the St. John’s company. Now at the close of the 1946 service year, we are nearly ready to take possession of the new property. Thus everything is in readiness for a tremendous purge against religion in the new 1947 service year. These developments are giving the Society a greater prestige among all people of good-will throughout the island.</span></p>

By the Lord’s grace, these seeds will not go unwatered in the coming service year, as all the Newfoundland brethren are determined to fulfill their blessed commission in these last days.

<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand have an excellent report for the service year 1946. One of the most outstanding features of the report is the way the publishers have distributed literature, exceeding their fondest hopes. The distribution of literature jumped from 42,000 to over 300,000 books and booklets in just this one year. But with the witness given by the distribution of literature the publishers were not satisfied. They followed through with back-calls. However, they do appreciate the need of doing better on book-study work, and this is the thing the local brethren say they will concentrate on during 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society hopes to send some Gilead graduates into New Zealand during the coming year, and we feel sure they will be welcome there. They will take along with them the latest organization instructions and will help the brethren in Theocratic work. Among other things, the report on New Zealand points out the good accomplished by the distribution of old literature, such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures, The Harp of God</span><span class="font5"> and other publications that have been in use for many, many years. One gentleman, put into solitary confinement because of his conscientious objection to war, was given a book by the jailer which the jailer termed a “punishment book”. This book was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Plan of the Ages.</span><span class="font5"> Having nothing else to do in solitary confinement, the individual read the book. Since his release he has attended the assembly and taken part in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another person bought some </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> at a secondhand book store. These aroused his interest and he came to the Society’s headquarters for some of the latest publications. One can never tell what good will be accomplished by the distribution of books. Place them. It is seed sown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report on New Zealand by the brother looking after the work there is interesting. A few excerpts are herewith set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 1945-46 there have been many blessings in New Zealand, and the work has shown steady progress. Literature distribution has been unprecedented and publishers are increasing, maintaining at the same time a good average of hours in the field. Yet the territory to be covered is large, requiring a tremendous amount of diligent and untiring effort on the part of all publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magazine witnessing is progressing, and in every town where a company of Jehovah’s witnesses is located magazine bags are regularly seen on the streets. We are frequently receiving orders to increase the distributors’ copies of the magazines for the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this country we have a forty-hour week and stores close all day Saturday and Sunday. Hence, street work is generally done on Fridays, especially Friday night, when all stores are open for business and the streets are crowded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New Zealand section of the Glad Nations Assembly will not be held until the end of this year, and all friends are looking forward with keen anticipation to this, our first united assembly since 1939. On that occasion we shall feast upon the overflow of the blessings you received at Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During April, the “Easter” holiday period, Jehovah’s witnesses met in convention for three days at Auckland and Dunedin. Here was demonstrated the value of the ministry training in delightful extemporaneous speeches given by various brethren and based on current </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowerg.</span><span class="font4"> At both towns a public meeting was arranged, each being well advertised by means of handbills, window cards, information walking, etc. At Auckland there was an attendance of more than 700, and at Dunedin over 200. At the latter town, an angry religionist wrote to the press protesting against the lecture and asking that Jehovah’s witnesses, previously banned, be silenced again—this time forever! He did not have matters all his own way, for other people defended Jehovah’s witnesses, condemning his attitude as an attempt to infringe upon the rights and freedoms of a minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An enjoyable feature of these conventions was the reunion with many young brethren just released from detention camps in which they had been held during the war years because of their refusal to break their covenant with Jehovah. It was pleasing to note the benefits derived by these brethren as a result of Theocratic school training, and other studies they were permitted to hold regularly during their long incarceration. Some also were present who had accepted the truth while in detention, and have, since their release, proved their appreciation by zealous activity in the Kingdom work.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is another country that finally gained its independence from Spain, and, to some extent, freedom from religious bondage; however, it is still a Catholic-dominated country. Its people are poor, uneducated and steeped in tradition. Religion’s miseducation has confused the minds of the people. But the Kingdom message is now penetrating the land, and the publications left with the people are doing them much good; for the Gilead graduates who started the work are studying with the interested ones in their own homes. A few years ago a zealous pioneer worked through this territory, especially in Managua, and some of the seed she sowed in 1934 fell on good ground. A Branch has been organized in this country and the report from the servant is very interesting. It follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first two graduates from Gilead to work in Nicaragua began in July, 1945, to work the capital city, Managua, setting up residence there and preparing for other missionaries who would follow them. Very little literature was obtainable, but witnessing began with sample copies of the publications to show to the people at the doors, and orders were taken for others like them to be delivered when shipments arrived. The few good-will persons In the city were contacted and studies started. When literature was received the people eagerly accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In October four more Gilead graduates arrived to help in the large field and accept their share of the responsibility of feeding the spiritually needy. With these six now in the field the “heap of witness” began to grow. All necessarily went through some trialsome days In getting accustomed to the very hot climate and new conditions with which they were confronted. But with the purpose in mind of building up the organization and getting a firm foothold, they continued to overcome the obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anxious to advertise in every way possible, the brethren planned a public meeting series, and in November Nicaraguans were greeted on the streets with handbills for the first time. The same week, a political disturbance and street-fight threatened to Interrupt any peaceful assembly, but over forty persons of good-will disregarding the politics of the old world came to listen. A Sunday-school teacher of the Evangelical church had received an Invitation, and, appreciating the message on the handbill, passed it on to several of his flock, he and six others attending the lecture. Satisfied that what he heard was the truth, he related the good news to the rest of his congregation, and on the following Sunday returned to the next lecture with the announcement that he had been thrown out of the church. Attending the meetings regularly both this man and his wife have become publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the end of December, nine special pioneers from the United States were reporting. Subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were beginning to come in, and the effect of numerous back-calls and book studies could be seen. Worried about the expansion of the work and seeing the sign on the door of the Kingdom Hall, “Testigos de JehovU,” one local religionist broke into print in one of the newspapers with an article entitled “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” and explaining that Jehovah does not need any witnesses. He was promptly given an answer in the next week’s periodical which made clear the purpose of all witnesses of Jehovah from ancient times to the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in April an immersion was held at which time two persons symbolized their consecration. Following this preparation was made for celebrating the Memorial. To provide for both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking good-will people that would attend, two discourses, one In each language, were prepared. The 52 persons that attended crowded the small Kingdom Hall. Five of these partook of the emblems. The joy of the brethren was great in seeing that the Lord’s spirit was directing their efforts and that so many persons had manifested interest in this celebration. A written invitation was. given to each of those assembled for the special meeting with Brother Knorr, stating the time and place and encouraging them to come with their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The long-awaited day finally arrived and all were on hand at the airport to meet the servants to their Central American brethren. For four days they were to stay, and they proved to be full of many good things. A special service meeting was arranged for the first evening, after which Brother Knorr related to those assembled, through his interpreter, Brother F. W. Franz, many of his experiences in countries previously visited. To hear how Jehovah’s witnesses were progressing in so many other countries greatly encouraged ail of us, especially those of new interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second day the president arranged a meeting with those brethren of the pioneer family, at which time he listened to many of the problems that had arisen and offered suggestions as to their solution. Here also he expressed the purpose of the Society to establish a Branch office in Nicaragua to carry on its business, and at the same time made new arrangements for the welfare of the Gilead pioneers working in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lecture, “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” scheduled for Sunday, April 28, was not to be a public meeting, and advertising was limited only to known persons of good-will. The roof garden of a four-story commercial building was offered by a person who knew of Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, which proved to be ideal. It has proved to be a very difficult task in the past to get the native Nicaraguans to go anywhere, especially to a meeting, in the heat of the day on Sunday when most of them are resting. For this reason, only about fifty, the regular attendance at </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">studies, were expected to attend. However, by the end of the two-hour, English-Spanish discourse 158 were sitting in the audience comfortable in the cool, made-to-order breeze from off Lake Managua, and listening to good sound reasons why they should be glad with Jehovah’s people. Many expressed that they had never heard anything like it, and all were eager to accept the free booklet that was offered for their examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a country ruled by military government, many of whose officials are under religious pressure, it might be expected that great obstacles would be thrown in the way of the witness work. However, Nicaragua authorities have shown very little opposition, and a few have rendered real aid. One publisher working his territory for the first time ran onto the police department together with quarters for the National Police. The publisher approaching the hard-boiled army major in charge was surprised to find that he spoke English fluently, and learned that he had served in the United States army in World War I. However, he was more surprised on presenting his testimony card to hear him ask for the publications and grant permission to visit all of the men under his charge. This man later obtained many more books and booklets and subscribed for both magazines. Following up the major’s invitation to witness to his men the publisher placed fifty more bound books in parts of four days’ work following his first contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another brother working in a very poor section of the city contacted three young men who were living together and who manifested a great deal of interest in the message. A study was started and soon all three of them were publishing. When the Glad Nations Assembly was announced to take place in the United States, these boys began to make plans to get there, selling even the bare necessities of their home to get money to pay their expenses. Traveling that far costs a great amount of money, and when they realized that not all could go, they pooled what they had saved and chose one of their group to go. This boy’s friends and employer made fun of him and his belief and his ambition, but he did not permit them to talk him out of going. When he left Nicaragua, after much trouble and delay in getting the necessary traveling papers, he had far too little money, but a great amount of faith and determination. Over a month later he arrived in Cleveland smiling, having contacted the brethren in the various countries and cities en route, who helped him get from one place to another. Elated over the convention, on his return to this country his first thought was to enroll as a pioneer, and his application has been accepted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak number of publishers for 1946 service year 36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the brethren who attended the assembly in the United States brought back wonderful reports of the activity there, and the great plans for expansion for the coming year. We who are working in this assignment realize that there is much to be done in building up and reconstructing the true worship of God in this land, and that it is His will for us to be here. Come what may, may we ever hold high the banner of Jehovah’s truth and righteousness so that all who will may come and hear and rejoice with his people from all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the war and up to the time that the Germans occupied Norway in 1940 there had been an average of 505 publishers reporting each month. It was impossible to keep records during the war, but the brethren went steadily forward preaching the gospel as they had opportunity. There are now 766 regular publishers proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, and they rose to a peak of 835 during the year. The hardships of the publishers, and especially the pioneers, are shown in the Branch servant’s report. The Branch servant is a former member of the Brooklyn Bethel family, who was sent to Norway during the year to assist in the reorganization and to look after the interests of the Society in that land. His report is interesting, and portions of it are set out here.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font4">Norway—a land of the midnight sun in summer and midday moon in winter season; with a coastline of deep, rockwalled fjords. The many islands along its coasts are inhabited by industrious fishermen. Tidy little hamlets dot the countryside, with here and there a large city or town. Its chief industries are the processing of wood pulp, manufacture of paper, canning of fish, and shipping. Behind its coastline of fjords and isles to the south, west and north, and extending eastward to the boundary of its neighbor country Sweden, is found a mountainous land well wooded with Norwegian fir and birch trees. Among the mountains one finds nestled here and there a long narrow valley, where farmers live and raise a part of the food needed for the country’s 3,000,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer work, having stopped during the war, was revived again in January when one pioneer began that feature of service. There being vast land areas and many large towns and even cities where little witness work had been done, the Society’s Branch office stressed the pioneer work for several months in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and letters. To this call to enter the pioneer service 47 have responded and now enjoy the most blessed privilege of a full-time servant of God. Some of the pioneers have had difficulty finding a place to live when they have gone to their assignments. Some were forced to seek another territory because of the housing shortage. Others sleep on the kitchen or parlor floors in the homes of people of good-will who have very little extra room to offer. But, as one pioneer sister whose territory is in northern Norway, above the arctic circle and bordering on the Arctic ocean, said, “I have at last found a place to stay. I sleep on the kitchen floor but am thankful to Jehovah that I have that.” Another pioneer sister of 71 years walked for two days from house to house to find a place to stay seven miles from her city territory, to which she walked or hitchhiked daily. A pioneer brother solved the housing shortage by building himself a little trailer just large enough to stand and lie down to sleep in. This trailer he moves to a central location behind his bicycle, and then works the homes round about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This housing shortage is a result of the Nazis’ burning every home, hamlet, town and city they came to in north Norway. Thus the homeless people were forced to seek refuge in the southern part. The government has requisitioned every extra room to be found and moved people in, until such time as new homes can be built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regardless of the housing hardships and the long miles to walk, hitchhike or cycle, the pioneers have pushed steadily ahead in their service. One pioneer brother, telling how he placed a book with a man, returned to make a back-call. He was met at the door by the man’s infuriated wife. The pioneer attempted to explain his message, but little was heard. Then, seeing the man with whom he placed the book, he ignored the wife to ask him how he liked it. ‘Yes,’ the man replied, ‘he had thought it very good.’ But, now the angry wife turned to her husband to rave at him. The man, not succeeding to quiet the wife, looked appealingly to the pioneer to give a hand. So the pioneer came forth tactfully, “Here you are quarreling just because of me and what I have brought you. I don’t want to be the cause of disunity in your home.” He continued, “You say the Bible says one thing and what I have brought you says differently. I would suggest that we sit down and let the Bible itself give the true answer.” This was grumbllngly agreed to. At the end of an hour the wife was dumfounded with the new-found truth, that the earth was not to be destroyed, that hell was not hot, etc., as she had been taught in her church. Invitation was heartily given the pioneer to make a return visit and he would get coffee instead of a scolding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first issue of the Norwegian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> published was the October 1, 1945, issue, which was mailed to 1,127 subscribers. At the end of the 1946 service year we had 8,267 active subscribers. Jehovah has blessed the work with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in this land. During the campaign there were obtained 4,034 new subscriptions and the new subscriptions have steadily mounted since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the books placed were in the Swedish and Danish languages. But on Brother Knorr’s visit to Norway and his learning of the need for Norwegian books he arranged on his return to Brooklyn for the printing of the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> together with the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered, Protection</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Safety,</span><span class="font4"> and had these sent to Norway. These publications were received with real joy, for now the publishers could go to the doors and offer the people a Norwegian book, which increased the opportunities for book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren were further made glad when Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel visited Norway on their European tour last winter. Before this visit the Devil had attempted to disrupt the Lord’s organization in this land by bringing division among the brethren. A meeting was arranged for in Oslo and Bergen. The brethren of both sides were invited. Brother Knorr in his talk to the brethren showed how the Devil’s purpose is to disrupt the Lord’s people in every way he can. He showed the folly of following the opinions of men, and showed how the Lord is leading his organization and that it is the greatest wisdom to follow Jehovah’s instructions to be in the right way. The result of Brother Knorr’s admonition has been very gratifying and encouraging in that there has been not even an echo heard of this former strife and disunity among the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the Norwegian brethren came through the war with very little clothing left with which to dress themselves. Brother Knorr arranged for the Swedish brethren to send what they could gather. Some two tons were gathered and sent. But the need and requests for clothing were much greater than the quantity. The Branch office made request for help from America. More than six tons of used clothing was sent. Another ton came from Sweden. A total of over eight tons of used clothing was received and has now been sent out to more than 3,000 publishers and people of goodwill. Many letters are received expressing thanks to Jehovah and our Swedish and American brethren for their unselfish help. Especially has this gift been appreciated by the pioneers who had very little clothing to keep going In fulltime service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Brooklyn office made arrangements to send an American brother from the Brooklyn Bethel family to Norway as Branch servant. This brother arrived in Norway January 17, 1946, a few weeks after Brother Knorr’s visit. The purpose of sending the American brother to Norway was to reorganize the witness work as it is done in the United States under Theocratic organization instructions. Much has been accomplished in the way of reorganization but much is yet to be done. We have yet to start the public meeting work and the servant to the brethren visits to the companies. Both of these features will be started in the first or second month of the coming service year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is very good to his people in giving them the privilege to bear witness of his supremacy, word and purpose, and thus have opportunity to show their faith and love for him. By his grace all people in this land will be witnessed to so those of good-will may have opportunity to know and serve him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Panama made request some years ago for Gilead graduates to help them. Special pioneers have now been working there for some time, and the local brethren, along with many persons of goodwill, appreciate the splendid service they have rendered. However, there is still a crying need for more pioneers, because there are thousands of persons living in the interior of Panama who have as yet not been reached. Panama city and Colon are being well served, but as years go on the message must be taken to all the people possible. Arrangements are under way now to meet this need and shortly more graduates from Gilead will be going to that country to start on the interior cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In many parts of the country the work is carried on in two languages, principally Spanish but also in English. So when the magazine publishers work on the street corners they have to call out two slogans, one in English and one in Spanish. This makes the work very interesting. A descriptive report of the work in Panama was sent in by the newly appointed Branch servant and it is a pleasure to publish portions of his write-up in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Colorful, cosmopolitan Panama! Crossroads of the world I Here it is truly our privilege to invite all nations to be glad, being made up as It is of people from every corner of the globe. Ships and airplanes coming from everywhere, going everywhere; on many of them are Gilead graduates headed for their foreign assignments and whom we are privileged to entertain. On the ships are people going to every port of the world. One came through carrying British war brides headed for Australia, one of whom, on seeing a magazine publisher on the street, dashed up to her and exclaimed, “Oh, this makes me so homesick for London!” explaining that London streets are filled with magazine publishers. Soldiers and sailors passing through speak of how they see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> wherever they go; one saw it first in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While we thrill to see the “sheep” come forward, the antics of the “goats” amuse us. One of such approached a magazine publisher and inquired about the magazines. When the publisher began to explain, the woman, who was quite well dressed and evidently a prominent person, became incensed, using vile and abusive language against the work and telling passers-by not to take the magazines. Just then a Panamanian woman stopped and took a magazine, and after having paid for it the other woman snatched it out of her hand anil used vile language to her. At this point a North American woman stopped and took one also, and again the other woman snatched it out of her hand, but this time it was snatched back by the American and the other woman was really furious! She swore she would see to it that the work was stopped. Then she called a cop to arrest the publisher, which he refused to do, even laughing at her. White with rage, and seeing she was getting nowhere, she went off down the street muttering to herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year distribution of the special issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> was made to all Spanish officials, who received it quite readily, many showing good interest, and some have subscribed for it since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign exceeded all expectations, as the report shows. In keeping in contact with the subscribers much interest has been worked up and many new book studies have been organized. We are now looking forward eagerly to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the servant to the brethren visited all companies once. He organized four new companies, bringing the total up to eight, as one new company had been organized previous to his visit. Also, three new pioneers enrolled during the year, making a total of four for the Republic. There are now eleven Gilead graduates in Panama; four arrived the first of the year and took up their duties in Colon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Memorial was a joyous occasion among the Lord’s people here as we realized by many outward signs that our King is indeed drinking the wine anew with his church in the Kingdom. That night of April 16 was celebrated by 146 of his witnesses and their companions, of which 26 signified their communion in the body of Christ by partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next day, April 17, was also a big day for Panama, for shortly after noon of that day the president and the vice-president of the Society arrived here. Their five-day visit not only was a period of refreshment and strengthening for all the brethren who were privileged to attend the two-day assembly in Panama city, but also marked a big step forward In the advancement of the Kingdom interests here. The establishment of missionary homes is deeply ap-predated by the special publishers, as the arrangement gives them greater security both materially and spiritually. But additional blessings more directly affecting all the brethren came through the establishment of a Branch in Panama city. With the direction of the work centralized locally the work is moving forward more rapidly and with greater efficiency, to the benefit of all concerned. We are grateful to the great Theocrat for all these blessings which have made his people here a part of his “glad people” In the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Crowning the year with his goodness Jehovah called his people together in his “Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly”. Although no one from the Republic of Panama was privileged to be bodily present at the actual convention in Cleveland, all were assembled there spiritually. Rich indeed was the portion of the feast we received by air mall in the form of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Messengers, Awake!</span><span class="font4"> programs, and even the new book releases. Letters written by faithful companions present at the Assembly gave the brethren here a view of the proceedings through many pairs of eyes. Thus our appreciation was greater in that respect than if seen by one pair of eyes in personal attendance. Truly, “blessed Is the nation whose God is Jehovah.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Before global war II there were 373 publishers in the Philippine Islands. Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide are well acquainted with the atrocities the Japanese army perpetrated in the Philippines. Despite all the trials the few faithful servants of the Lord kept at preaching the Kingdom gospel; and when the war had come to an end in the Islands and all were able to move forward proclaiming the good news, we find an average of 1,033 publishers. In fact, by August 1946 a peak of 2,069 publishers was reached. The real interest on the part of the people of good-will is shown in that 4,000 persons attended a convention at Lin-gayen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every effort has .been put forth by the Branch servant to get all companies organized, and during the year the companies increased from 64 to 101. It is a joy to see these people of good-will come together, representing many tongues in the Philippines, praising Jehovah. These people have been made glad with Jehovah’s nation. However, since the war’s end not all has been peace for Jehovah’s witnesses in this land. They have had some very severe court trials and persecutions, and are affected by the great disturbances in the land. The Filipinos gained their independence during the year, but it seems that not all the people in the Islands agree with the present setup. The resulting disturbances within the land affect Jehovah’s witnesses considerably. The report of the Branch servant brings to our attention some of these difficulties; but it also assures us that the brethren are rejoicing in their privileges of service, and are anxious for more literature. The Society is doing everything it can to supply them. Some excerpts from the Philippines report will be enjoyed by all the readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the great increase of the work here, It was necessary for us to look for a bigger place, and the Lord provided one through a consecrated family who offered their home to be used as office and Kingdom Hall for the Manila company, with the basement floor as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">todega or </span><span class="font4">stockroom for the Society. We are looking forward for the Lord’s arrangement in providing us a home for the Society. Owing to the great increase In the work, to the Bethel family of three, two are added. But even these five could hardly cope with the work. With the great amount of work in the office and home yet they utilize what little spare time they have in witnessing ‘publicly and from house to house’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On April 16 the faithful were united with their brethren all over the earth in the celebration of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. 4,185 attended the celebration. Of these 7 partook of the emblems of the Memorial, which tends to show that the “great multitude” have definitely manifested themselves and that they are appreciating their true position and their relationship to The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To hasten and facilitate the reorganization of the companies in northern Luzon, the servant to the brethren arranged a two-day assembly in conjunction with the Memorial celebration, where company activities including public lectures were demonstrated. More than 2,000 brethren attended, most of whom participated in the street gospelpreaching, in house-to-house witnessing, in the information walking and the distribution of invitations to the public lectures, one given in Ilocano and the other in Pangasinan. The assembly was a huge success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lingering evil result of the past war is the armed disturbances all over the Philippines, especially in the central Luzon region and in the Moroland. Banditry and secret organizations terrorize inhabitants of rurals and not seldom are there bloody clashes or battles between the armies of that ‘state within the state’ and the MP’s and MPC’s. Because of this farming is being neglected in central Luzon, the ‘granary of the Philippines’, with the result that there has been food-shortage here and the worst shortage yet confronts the people. In addition to the above evil, typhoons and locusts destroyed the crops in the Cagayan Valley and in northern Mindanao. Not a few letters from central Luzon, Cagayan Valley and Mindanao come to the office voicing the hardships and difficulties the brethren are facing in those regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just the other day the pioneer group assigned to cover the province of Tayabas returned to the city. While they were lodging in the municipal building of the town of Mauban, for the night, about 100 armed men raided the municipal building, disarmed the police, took two of them, imprisoned the rest, got all their arms and looted the treasurer’s office, especially the safe. The brethren were investigated and when they found that they did not belong to the police force, they only got their money and clothes and left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We want to thank our American brethren who have thought of the poor brethren in the Philippines. The clothes they sent have come, and nothing is missing, in spite of unrestrained looting at the piers. This relief will certainly help them, especially in their witnessing work, for truly clothing is one of the big problems of many brethren because of the war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In harmony with your letter, we have proposed to hold a national convention here in the capital city, Manila, this coming November. It has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> fond desire and hope of the brethren here that the president of the Society visit them. We still hope the Lord will grant our desire, and for that reason we are cordially inviting you and some other brethren from the Home Office to visit us, if convenient and it is the Lord’s will, during our convention in November.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is a joy for us to receive from Poland our first annual report in eight years. Jehovah’s witnesses in this land have now been actively engaged in the Lord’s service for a full year beyond the war’s end. As far as the country itself is concerned, there is no cessation of hostilities; but in its great trial and difficulty many people are made glad with His people. There is a grand increase of the work in Poland, for thousands are now coming forward and praising Jehovah’s name. The Branch servant tells a very interesting story of what has happened during the past year and what difficulties they have encountered. He tells of the great migration of Germans, Poles and Russians, and how the Lord has used the disrupted circumstances to magnify his name among the people of Russia, Poland and Germany. Our Polish brethren are not discouraged, but they rejoice in their trials, for they have greater opportunities to praise the Lord and to preach the good news to the troubled people. Surely here in Poland there is found a peaceful people preaching a glad message. The reader of the Branch servant’s report on the work in Poland should be moved to greater action in praising Jehovah’s name. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Standing now on the threshold of a new year and letting the events of the service year just ended pass slowly before our mind’s eye, we see how greatly the Lord has succored and supported us according to his infinite goodness and we have countless reasons to thank and glorify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The internal situation of the country has become a little quieter in the meantime, but the Roman Catholic clergy do everything within their power to prevent the country from settling into orderly and regulated habits of living. Immense stretches of the country are quite unsafe; bands of ruffians infest the country, rob and plunder whole trains, terrorize the population. The life of man has become a thing of no value. The Inviolability of a man’s person and his place of dwelling does not exist. The people are dissatisfied and cannot find what they are looking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these circumstances it Is easy to understand why the clergy are successful in leading these hostile bands against our brethren, to attack and plunder their homes and to terribly manhandle the brethren themselves, whereby many have lost their Ilves. They attempt to force them to hang up religious pictures and images again, to repeat church prayers, and strive to wring from them the promise to attend church again. But they do not achieve their end. Our sisters, whose hair has even been shorn off because of their adamant attitude, are glad to submit to the removal of this their adornment rather than to waver in their integrity to their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection we would also mention a particular sign of the times: The people take their stand for the truth here with surprising rapidity, and Immediately take an active share in the witness work. The “interested for years” symptom has quite ceased here now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For instance, today Catholics attending a one-day convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and hearing for the first time the words of truth from the Scriptures explained in an orderly manner, a month later are already standing in the ranks of the publishers and glorify God for this grace which has become their portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young Catholic girl heard of the truth for the first time in more detail at such an assembly, and turning then to a brother she remarked: “Everything, yes, everything I can understand, except this one thing: that a person should then go Into the water and be completely immersed!” A month later this same young woman attended another assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and appeared among the candidates for this same symbol. As it happened, the same brother was also present, and after the immersion service approached this sister with her own words saying: ‘Everything, yes, everything, but one thing I cannot understand, and that is that a person can go </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font4"> into the water!' “Yes, Jehovah has also shown me his great grace!” was her brief and significant answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another experience: A brother begins to give a witness on the truth in a railway compartment. A young lady, an educated Catholie, contradicts with decision; a Russian girl sitting beside her asks questions. Thereupon the brother asks the Catholic whether she would be so kind and translate a few sentences in Russian, his knowledge of this language being insufficient. She is not unwilling and complies with his request. At the close of their conversation both girls gave their addresses to the brother and asked to be called upon. A month later this same Catholic is a witness for the name of Jehovah and is zealously working with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with your suggestion in the annual instructions for the individual countries, we have now commenced to hold in many different centers, to suit the local needs of the country, a series of one-day conventions, which for the main part are attended by well over a thousand brethren. In this way a very thorough witness is given locally and the results are most gratifying. Many of those who were difficult of approach by other means, begin now to take an interest in the truth. Expenses are kept very low for the publishers too, for each participant brings his food for the day with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A two-day convention in the band-infested dangerous zone of Lublin held on the 9th and 10th June 1946 at which about 2,000 brethren from that region assembled together, constituted a thrilling take-off for this series of gatherings. This was tlie greatest Theocratic convention that has ever been arranged by Jehovah’s witnesses in this country; yet it was only a gathering for one of our zones in the eastern part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point another special event must be mentioned: the consignment of clothing from Brooklyn. We had, all together, 160 large cases of clothing, underlinen and footwear, and could thereby relieve the need of the brethren who had suffered in the concentration camps and prisons, and others too who had come into poverty and privation through the effects of war or had been robbed of all their possessions in the attacks by Catholic gangs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through this great gift not only has the need of the brethren been relieved, but, above all, the bonds of fellowship have been strengthened. Many letters which have reached us here express the deep gratitude of the brethren to Jehovah God and the brethren in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one of our twelve zones the brethren have erected a Kingdom Hall out of the boards from these cases, accommodating 70 to 80 persons, this being cause for still further joy to these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A further evidence of the Lord’s rich blessing upon us is the fact that our company of publishers has risen during this service year, while the process of organizing has been going on, from an average of 2,000 to 6,000, and this despite the fact that about 2,000 brethren of German tongue were forcibly uprooted, deprived of the possibilities of earning a livelihood here, and had to emigrate to the west. Only a few are still here and these too will have to leave the country in due course. The situation of these brethren will be appreciated when one considers that it is seized upon as a crime if one is found to give a German a night’s shelter or to lend him a helping hand in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover, Russian and Ukrainian brethren still living in Poland had to travel to the east, and on the other hand a certain number of brethren of Polish tongue from the east have again been repatriated here. All this coming and going has contributed to the truth’s rapidly spreading into such areas where in normal times it would hardly have reached. And so even all these unhappy circumstances have played their part in the glorification of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In closing this report we would like once again to express our deep appreciation to our beloved brethren in America, who are endeavoring so earnestly to serve us with all the necessary means and particularly their efforts in providing us with the spiritual food, in as far as this is possible under the present circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And in accordance with the great love which we receive, so we wish to be imbued with the same spirit and to do on our part all that can be done to transmit the necessary spiritual food to our brethren in Russia. May the Lord bless both your efforts and ours.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Reports of the good news going into this vast territory come through the Polish office. As far back as 1932 efforts were made by the brethren in Magdeburg, Germany, to send single sheets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and other material into Russia by private letters. Few addresses of people of good-will were then known; but every effort was made to send spiritual food to hungry ones within the borders of the U. S. S. R. After 1932 the Society tried to send small packets of Bible literature into Russia from Poland, but most of these were returned bearing the words “Not Permitted”. In the country of Poland there were many Ukrainians and Russians and these persons had a warm desire in their heart to see the Kingdom gospel preached in that great land of Russia. They were fully cognizant of the Lord Jesus’ statement at Matthew 24, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness ...” Did this mean Russia ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Russian and Ukrainian brethren in Poland studied the Word of God diligently and were good publishers. Then came the outbreak of war in 1939. At that time there were only a thousand publishers in Poland. Many of them, however, soon came under Russian rule. Now, by some strange turn of events, Jehovah’s witnesses who had tried for so many years to get the message into Russia were within the newly established boundaries of that country. They found themselves transplanted, overnight as it were, into another country. What a field was open before them! These brethren took advantage of their new opportunities. The Polish Branch servant gives us a most absorbing report of this situation. Upon reading it we feel that, no matter where a publisher lives in the world, each one will want to preach. There are people of good-will scattered unto the ends of the earth. These are to be found, for they are commanded to “be glad, ye nations, with his people”. When these people are found, they must hear the clarion call to “praise Jehovah, all ye nations”. Surely Russia is not to be excluded from the glad nations. Within the borders of this land people are praising Jehovah, thousands of them. Here follow excerpts from the Polish Branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brethren in Russia immediately adopted a wholly positive attitude and were ready, as all earth-wide, to bear all consequences, but to in no wise act against the commandment of the Lord. They have maintained their neutrality and have kept the everlasting covenant. For this reason already in 1941 several hundred of our brothers were transferred into the interior of Russia. Here they immediately commenced a lively Theocratic activity and began to make disciples out of the peoples of this immense Russian empire. The letters which readied us were inspiring and we were grateful to the Lord that he now held out the opportunity to many people of good-will to take their stand on the side of Jehovah. And the blessings resulting from this first great campaign of transplantation were twofold.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The brethren who were scattered over tremendous distances sought association with people of good-will that they might lead them to the truth, and such people were to be found everywhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The other great blessing resulting from this transplantation was that the many people of good-will at home recognized the attitude of our brethren as the only correct one, and hence they began to get into touch with the witnesses and to glorify and praise Jehovah God in unison with them. The number of publishers began to grow more rapidly than ever before in this territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When in 1944 the Nazi-monster was thrust westward, every leg that was whole was mobilized in Western Ukraine to bring the war to a favorable conclusion for Russia. Again our brethren have maintained the inviolability of the everlasting covenant and their neutrality. A number forfeited their lives on account of their faithfulness to the Lord, and others—this time it was well over 1,000—were again carried eastward to the wide plains of this immense continent. The experiences of 1941 began to repeat themselves, only on a far greater scale. Many brothers found the ground prepared for the witness work by the activity of those already transferred In 1941, and, to the boundless joy of all, could resume relations with these dear brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1945 the Lord opened up the way for us to reach the brethren in southern Russia. These brethren had come under Russian rule through the separation of the former Rumanian territory, Bessarabia, and for six long years had been completely severed from all connections. It was a very special joy for our publishers to render a helping hand to these brethren in a good and effective organizing of the witness work. Here too we have had gratifying results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By Jehovah’s grace, in the year 1946 it was possible for almost all publishers in the whole of Russian territory to assemble together for the Memorial celebration, and the result was:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At the same time the field service report for April 1946 showed a total of 4,940 publishers in the Russian field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work is being done under the most difficult conditions in Russia. The witnesses have no printed literature and no </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in its attractive printed form at their disposal. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> must be mimeographed. In many instances it is still being laboriously copied by hand and so passed on to others as was done during the war. Our couriers are sometimes held up and thrown into jail if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is found on them. Many brethren who had particularly to do with the extension of the Theocratic activity have been deprived of their freedom. But the work goes on nevertheless and the number of publishers increases continually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brethren in Russia are called upon to bear difficulties of various kinds. Among other things, at the beginning of 1946 a wave of arrests passed over Jehovah’s people when they refused to take part in the elections. In certain cases brethren lost their lives, and in numerous other instances they were maltreated and robbed of their freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1945, In Russia 1,316 persons symbolized their consecration by water immersion. We are certain that for the year 1946 this figure will be exceeded by far, but we regret that we have not been able to get the complete figures. In Russia such immersion services are held only In summer, and the last two main summer months are missing from the figures. Yet this incomplete report shows 435 newly baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1945, 4,724 persons regularly attended the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses in Russia, while in 1946 this number has risen to 8,633. As we were comparatively late in resuming connections with the work there, it has not yet been possible to properly organize the back-call and book-study work with interested people as this is being done elsewhere with such wonderful results. The brethren are being prepared for this now, however, and with the beginning of the new service year this new feature of the work will be immediately commenced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From this first field service report it can be seen that the Lord is already preparing for a grand Theocratic activity in this mighty region, and we sincerely hope that at the appointed time this may be put into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the provisions of the instruction in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> the publishers here are being equipped for a still greater activity, and we confidently look forward to the wonders which the Lord will have performed in this land.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This overpopulated island is not as yet overpopulated with publishers for the Kingdom; but it is very interesting to observe that just a few years ago there were only one or two publishers, whereas now a peak of 53 publishers has been reached. There is a real need for many more full-time publishers in Puerto Rico. This small island has 28 towns with populations ranging from 4,000 to 90,000 that have as yet not been witnessed to by any Kingdom publishers. However, the Gilead graduates who have gone there rejoice in the privileges of service they have and are making glad these people with Jehovah’s nation. Very interesting experiences have been enjoyed by the brethren during the past year, and the Branch servant gives us the high points of the field work for 1946. Excerpts are set out below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Puerto Rico also has publishers, though, in comparison, they are not as numerous as the people. But they are publishing and seeking the lovers of righteousness in their island and they never have to go far to find people with whom to talk. Transportation facilities are not the problem here as in many other Latin-American countries. Constant streams of buses, some very modern, crowd the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">carreteras </span><span class="font4">of the capital, San Juan, while the island’s unusually good highway system Is well traversed by buses and many recent-model cars and, by way of contrast, it has its old ox-drawn carts as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though the actual work of witnessing in the homes and from door to door is at present confined to just two cities on the northern coast of the island, yet the message Is being sounded back into the island by another means, that of the radio. The latter part of the service year saw another program begun over an Arecibo station; this In addition to the weekly program already being broadcast free by a station in San Juan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The manner in which the Arecibo radio program was arranged well illustrates the fact that the people of Puerto Rico are not as much dominated by Catholicism as that religious organization would have one believe and as they boastfully advertised recently by putting up street banners throughout San Juan reading “Viva Puerto Rico Catolico”. One of the Gilead graduates assigned to Arecibo was working in a rural section just outside the city and came to a new radio station recently established and still partly in process of construction. The publisher called at the manager’s office, having in mind the possibility that a program might be arranged. After explaining the educational character of the Bible work of Jehovah’s witnesses and having made the statement that their work was rather new to many people in that section, he was rather surprised to hear the manager say, “Well, why aren’t you using the radio?” The publisher remarked that he had that purpose in mind when calling. He was informed thereupon that the station would grant them free time any day of the week they selected. The manager stated that though the Catholic Church dominated the people of the island, about 75 percent were Catholic in name only because born of Catholic parents and attended church only when fiesta time came. No doubt many are hearing the Kingdom gospel in their homes by means of these two weekly programs and will eventually be reached by actual publishers calling at their doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the latter part of March the activity here was given added impetus by a much-appreciated visit by the Society’s president and vice-president. Their arrival was preceded a few days before by that of five more Gilead brethren coming to aid those already here. During Brother Knorr’s brief stay definite steps were taken to aid the forward movement of the work. The first day of his visit a Branch office was established and began functioning April 1. It is good to note that since its establishment each succeeding month has seen a larger number of company publishers reporting, culminating in August with an all-time peak of 40 company publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instructions were also left to find larger living quarters in a more central location suitable for a Branch office. The lack of a central meeting-place seems to have been the main difficulty in building up the San Juan company in particular, as the present location is rather out-of-the-way as mentioned in last year’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the president’s visit opportunity was also given to the people in and around Puerto Rico’s capital to manifest their interest in the glad message proclaimed to them by Jehovah’s witnesses. Prior to his coming a public meeting was arranged for March 26 in San Juan’s Ateneo Puerto-rriqueno. When the night of Brother Knorr’s talk on “Be Glad, Ye Nations” came the 40 some publishers in attendance were very glad to find some 220 other good-will persons sitting around them being made glad also by the good information in Brother Knorr’s talk and its lively Spanish interpretation by Brother Franz. 260 in all attended. Since then a series of public meetings has been held out under Puerto Rican skies in one of the public plazas with attendances ranging from 75 to 100 throughout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the visit by Brothers Knorr and Franz, which ended happily with a service talk, and the release of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> in Spanish, the eight specials assigned to San Juan began putting in many hours in searching for a new location for the Branch office and missionary home and also to serve as a meeting-place for the San Juan company. This was done in conjunction with their regular witnessing activity and extended over a period of two months. Housing conditions all over the island are very critical and real estate prices have risen sharply, but finally a suitable place was found and purchased on June 21. It is in a quiet and pleasant, yet very central location and can accommodate a dozen missionaries in addition to providing space for the Branch office and storage of literature. It has a fairly large room also which will be used for the holding of company meetings. It is a matter of regret, however, to state that at the time of making out this report we have not been able as yet to gain occupancy of the property, due to present OBA rulings. We are trusting, though, that very soon now the Lord’s spirit or active force will clear the way that we may begin putting the property to good use in advancing the Kingdom interests throughout the island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly” at Cleveland saw nine of our brethren in attendance, two of whom were Puerto Ricans. We are now looking forward to their return and the happiness and increased zeal they will no doubt bring with them. We also rejoice to know that two more Gilead graduates will be returning with them. Soon we shall be assembling in our own convention, and expect the best attendance ever. Good evidence of this as a probability was the success of the past </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign, which added 439 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers to the list of Puerto Rican readers of that illuminating periodical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are sure the years will not be so many until there will be a thousand publishers on this little island of Puerto Rico and its smaller neighbors, the Virgin Islands. Though opposition may increase and persecution come, yet we all face the coming year with courage and with confidence in a happy increase to come by the hand and guidance of our God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The war that overran this land has left it in distress and ruin. In Bucharest alone 12,000 homes were destroyed, thus making many people homeless. Rumania is a country with a large population, namely, sixteen million inhabitants, and twelve languages are spoken within its boundaries. This makes witnessing quite difficult, because one finds so many people speaking another language. Terrible persecution befell Jehovah’s witnesses during the years of war. Many were bound in fetters because they stood firmly for their beliefs; some were sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. But here again Jehovah has delivered them. The door of opportunity is open now, and it is encouraging to see 1,692 publishers out in the field regularly toward the end of the year. The Hierarchy has put forth strenuous efforts to stop the work, but the Lord’s people have moved on boldly and peacefully preaching the good message of the Kingdom. The servant looking after the work has this to report about conditions in Rumania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our production this year was small, and yet in comparison with the years of 1938-1939 it was double. At that time an edition of 30,000 copies of one booklet was sufficient, but now we print 100,000 copies. In former years we printed in four languages, namely, Rumanian, Hungarian, Russian and German. This year, i.e., 1945-1946, in two languages only; 7 booklets amounting in all to 646,912 copies in Rumanian, and 7 booklets with 221,800 copies in all in Hungarian. In addition to these booklets we have printed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">both in Rumanian and in Hungarian to the amount of 85,578 copies, and 150,000 advertising leaflets. We have great difficulty in printing because we cannot do it ourselves. There is also a great scarcity of paper here and we have had to purchase it on the black market just where we could find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all these assaults from outside and within, and with all deficiencies, Jehovah has blessed our efforts greatly during this year. We were able to hold 608 assemblies and public meetings, with a total attendance of 410,000, and 1,630 persons symbolized their consecration by water immersion. I have just returned from a public meeting held in a large town on the boundary of Hungary where a bishop of the Hierarchy has the domination, a rich man owning 30 percent of the town’s property, and where formerly Jehovah’s witnesses could exist only in secret. Now all streetcars carried large advertisements on their windows for two days announcing the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, and our brethren paraded with large placards. This convention was a great blessing, and the representative of the Hierarchy, with all his property, was powerless. All he could do was to preach in his churches warning the people not to attend the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, or otherwise to suffer hell-torment; if anyone did go to this convention, then he would be accursed of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the great hall was full to capacity, for the people have no more fear of the hell of the Hierarchy. Jehovah’s work has extinguished the fire of the Hierarchy’s hell. In other localities where the clergy cannot use the authorities any more for their persecution, they organize a band of hooligans to beat up Jehovah’s witnesses as they come into that locality to preach the gospel from</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">house to house with the literature. We have many legal proceedings against such clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneebs. The pioneers have much freedom in their work, but the question of food presents some difficulty, as this is procurable only against payment, and so it is necessary for the pioneers to be supported either by the Association or by the companies that send them food and clothing. What they receive from the literature is not sufficient to feed them, because our booklets are very cheap in com-parsion with the price of food and clothing. In the past year only 8 pioneers were engaged in the service, but we are now busy organizing this feature of the work more effectively for the coming year.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory under the supervision of the South African Branch, located at Cape Town, includes the Union of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa, St. Helena, and Tanganyika Territory. This covers a vast area, and there are approximately twenty-five million persons living in these lands. Of these, 22j millions are Africans and about 2| millions are Europeans. There are 14,089 publishers serving the Kingdom interests, on the average, every month. When one considers the population and the great area in which these people live, it is easy to appreciate the need of more publishers in the South African field. More laborers are needed; and it makes glad the heart of the brethren in South Africa to know that there are now being trained at Gilead a number of brethren from that field, who will soon return to their homeland. But they look forward not only to the return of these South African Gilead-trained brethren, for many more laborers are needed in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many difficulties to overcome—restrictions, bans, religious prejudice, illiteracy on the part of millions of people who can only speak a language. Despite these difficulties, the news of the Kingdom goes into the many lands and many are praising Jehovah from all of these nations. It can be said that, throughout this entire territory, there has been a marked increase in the making of back-calls, the conducting of book studies, and the holding of public meetings. In fact, the increase in publishers is 1,800 over the previous year; and the increase in hours for the entire territory was 702,422 over last year. The publishers in this vast area, 14,089 in number, devoted 4,773,010 hours to preaching the gospel. The report by the acting Branch servant is comprehensive, and brief excerpts pertaining to the different countries that come under the Branch office at Cape Town are set out here. The Branch servant is now at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, taking up a special course there after attending the Glad Nations Assembly at Cleveland. By the reading of this report one is able to appreciate the problems to be met in South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are passing from the service year 1945-46 into 1946-47 with the refrain of Cleveland, Ohio, ringing in our ears. The public press throughout the country and even in the Rhodc-sias, in both English and Afrikaans, published various news items sent over by United Press while the great Assembly was running. Various wireless stations sounded forth the news about the “mass baptism” in Lake Erie in catching phrase; and the bioscopes (movies) in the Union and Rhodesia are displaying the “Ohio Mass Baptism” in their newsreel feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are now very busy preparing to take up the reverberation of that great shout of praise to Jehovah at Cleveland, Ohio, at our coming Convention (October 17-22) at Johannesburg, and to pass it on to the people of good-will of the lands of Southern Africa, and so form a link in the great chorus of praise that is fast girdling the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only has Cleveland, Ohio, given us an increased sense of unity with our brethren in all parts of the earth, but on this occasion our thoughts and hearts have been intimately bound up with that event as with no other convention before; for tlie Branch servant and ten others managed to get passage on a U.S.A, marine boat, the “Marine Tiger”, and left our shores during the second half of May to reach the United States early in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now our hearts are most warmly tied up with the eighth class at Gilead, not merely because we love that seat of highest learning with a fervent love, but also because the Branch servant and a number of other South African witnesses are members of that student body. Just think of It! A number of Gilead students from South Africa and back in South Africa again so early in this postwar period! May this number soon increase to meet the vast possibilities of the South African field, both European, Africans and Coloreds, is our fervent prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the amount of good-will interest in the land is great Indeed is evident from the figures of those who attended the Memorial celebration during this year. There were 4,506 present on that occasion, of whom only 338 partook of the symbols. The number of good-will interest that were attending back-call book studies during the month of July was 15,697. The public meeting campaign has done much to feed this interest and prepare the ground for more back-calls and further studies, in that 1,566 such meetings have been conducted, all over the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many and varied have been the experiences of those who have shared in this glorious work. Old and young, vigorous and frail, male and female, have all played their part. One young lassie of 12 years reared in “the nurture and admonition of the Lord” had the following experience as related by her God-fearing mother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The weekly group study for our area is held in our home, and on the last study night I was summoned to the door to be greeted by an elderly gentleman who said, T am looking for a young girl named Kathleen. That is all I know about her, except that she has fair hair. She told me that you have a study at this address every week, but I do not know her full name.’ I welcomed him and asked him in, and then talked to him until it was time to start the study. My daughter of 12 had met this man on the door-to-door work in our neighborhood three weeks before, and he had subscribed for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and also taken a volume and booklets from her. She had spent half an hour at this home in all, and then invited him to attend the group study. He has promised to come again, and Kathleen’s cup is running over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only the permanent population of this country are catching up the strains of the “new song”, but some of the many Italian prisoners of war in this country have also heard and responded to it. A zealous pioneer at Pietermaritzburg, Natal, writes about an Italian P.O.W. in Maritzburg that took the truth soon after he was transferred to Zonderwater, 32 miles from Pretoria, where he started Bible studies dailj- with the result that many have accepted the truth. One of Jehovah's witnesses called at the camp with a small supply of Italian literature, which was snapped up in no time. The above-mentioned Joseph is at present in Pietermaritzburg awaiting embarkation and repatriation, and has attended our headquarters meetings. He pleaded with us to do what we can for the good-will interest at Zonderwater, He handed us three names of P.O.W.’s whom he refers to as brothers and whom publishers should contact and supply with literature; these three men, he assures me, will do the rest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this vast area of 290,000 square miles, 15,000 Europeans dwell in the midst of an African population of a million people divided into about 70 different tribes with at least 30 distinct languages in use. The predominant tongues spoken by these are Cinyanja, Cibemba and Sikololo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work done by the servants to the brethren has been very fruitful, except perhaps in teaching quite illiterate friends how to fill out reports and read anything with understanding. Often in this matter progress is halting and many reports received are confused, but the mind which cannot master arithmetic does appreciate the gospel and often an ignorant and unlearned people find in the simplicity of “this gospel of the Kingdom” a quickening power which sometimes produces men whose ability to read and write —gained mostly from studying the Scriptures and Theocratic literature, and making notes—staggers men who do not realize the power of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the Copperbelt and on the line of rail things are rather different. Here the companies are better organized and their numbers have to be seen to be believed. The Memorial at Luanshya brought 1,850, and this is by no means an exceptional attendance. A missionary recently went near a study center during the opening of the meeting and heard the songs. He got off his cycle, wiped his brow, and said: ‘These people even have new songs. What can we do?’ His best men were slipping through his fingers, and it is by no means only the songs that are troubling him. Another parson in an effort to stem the tide arranged for members of his congregation to call at the huts of the people like Jehovah’s witnesses and invite them to ‘church’, but they were met by an astonished householder who, after listening to their halting talk, told them that they had no message like the ‘Watlcltawala’, and after this unsuccessful trial the dlsspirit-ed church-goers returned and their congregation was no larger!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a crying need for more competent servants to the brethren. In an effort to overcome this lack at the beginning of the year a special 10-day course was arranged at the depot for all full-time workers and any who wished to enter their ranks. Much was done, and from early in the morning until evening instruction was given In the various aspects of the work by one of the Europeans at the depot. Many went away greatly strengthened and clearer in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This part of the field lies on the northern borders of the Union of South Africa and has more in common with it than any of the territories in the South African field, including its legal code or system. There is representative government here dependent on the adult European vote of the 80,000 Europeans. The African population dwelling in this land of 150,354 square miles in area is 1,607,000 in number. It is due to the more democratic form of government in vogue in this country that the Jesuitic effort to get the sedition law so framed as to put our books in the same position as in Northern Rhodesia completely failed in 1936. It was in this colony too that the lawsuit was instituted which finally came up before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the Union of South Africa, which in its judgment completely exonerated the Society’s literature of sedition in intention and held that the teachings in these books are, on the other hand, to the contrary, viz., against any subversive or seditionary activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During World War II the government, however, took advantage of wartime powers to ban the literature. These wartime restrictions, with few exceptions, have now been repealed. The restrictions imposed on the Society’s literature are not among the exceptions so that the literature is free for entry again as it had been immediately after the above decision of the Appellate Court in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Europeans. During the year the public meeting series was enthusiastically carried forward. At Bulawayo, the </span><span class="font4">city and most of the surrounding districts were served. Slxty-four public meetings were reported, with a total attendance of 1,107. The accommodation included the small city hall, schoolrooms, sundry halls and private houses. Our experience in this series has been that the districts served often have had a growing attendance each time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Africans. In one compound near Bulawayo the African friends had been zealously and regularly covering their assignment, by preaching the good news of God’s kingdom from door to door and by means of Bible studies at the homes of the interested, bringing comfort and encouragement to many. Religionists approached the compound manager with the objection that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses was causing many to leave off attending church. On investigation tliis compound manager could find nothing irregular about the conduct of the witnesses; but the religionists continued to press him, thereby causing him to call Jehovah’s witnesses and advise them that unless they ceased their activities he would have to sign them off at the end of the month. The witnesses continued their Christian activities, and at the end of the month were called up to be discharged. They asked the manager for a letter embodying </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">reason for their discharge from work and the compound, but he explained he could not give this, as it would get him into trouble!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At a group witnessing effort in another compound witnesses met a compound police sergeant who was also a zealous member of the Salvation Army. The witnesses explained their work to him and the report from the friends continues: 'Then he said, “You are under arrest,” and he took them to the office of the compound manager. At the Office the compound manager asked the sergeant, “Why do you bring these people here?” He replied, “They are Jehovah’s witnesses.” “What were they doing, were they making trouble?” The sergeant said, “No, they were doing their witness work.” And the compound manager said: “Well, there is no trouble about doing witness work.” Then he said to the sergeant, “Are you </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> Christian?” and the sergeant answered, “Yes.” The manager then said to him, “You cannot be a Christian when you are against other Christians.” Then he said, “I do not want you to bring Jehovah’s witnesses into my office, because they are doing their Jehovah’s work; even If you are against God yourself, let Jehovah’s witnesses preach to those who wish to hear them.” Then turning to Jehovah’s witnesses he said, “You can continue your work.” Now this sergeant felt very </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">much </span><span class="font4">ashamed at what he had done and we have now many back-calls and book studies in that compound.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The beneficent influence of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has for many years been recognized and admitted by the government of Nyasaland, which, like Northern Rhodesia, is under the British Colonial Office in London. Latterly, however, without any occasion as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned there has been a complete reversal of this favorable attitude, which can only be ascribed to missionary pressure, especially to that of the Catholic priests not only in Nyasaland but coming also from other Catholic centers in Southern Africa. The refusal of the government to release literature which was imported into the territory after a government import license had been obtained, is evidence of their most unreasonable and uncalled-for change of front. A petition requesting the release of this literature was circulated in the country during the latter part of the service year 1945-46 and lias greatly impressed this isolated and somewhat dormant British colony and has done a great deal to awaken the minds even of the indifferent European population to the injustice perpetrated on Jehovah’s people. The depot servant writes as follows about the work in this land during the past service year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To us in this country the visit of the Branch servant in October 1945 was as a forerunner to the expansion which we hope to be our lot in the near future. There Is work in plenty for two European brethren at the depot and for many pioneers, both general and special, to care for the Kingdom interests in the villages. There are still hundreds of villages hardly touched in all three provinces of the country and the majority of people are sick and tired of religion; they want something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That which has occupied the minds of most of us has been the question of the release of the Society’s publications by the government and their distribution in this country. Although the emergency laws under which the Society’s publications fell were repealed in the fall of 1945, further regulations banning many of the publications, both new and old, were shortly thereafter gazetted. Efforts to have these conditions removed and the freedom of worship restored are being made, but things do move so very slowly I The whole community needs stirring up; they apparently suffer from sleeping-sickness of a very severe nature. The petition w'orried them a bit, and if they had known of what </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">were about they would doubtless have attempted to interfere. But as it is, close on 47,000 petitioners were bold enough to affix their signatures to the Petition forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many other thousands of people of good-will were held in fear of action being taken against them should they subscribe their names. The government has not yet replied to the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The servant who visited the companies in the Portuguese territory from Nyasaland in November 1945 managed to put the Kingdom work there on a better footing than it had been in the past years. His operations were somewhat hampered by the unreasonable attitude taken by the officials in that country towards any organization other than that of the Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the closing days of 1945 four brethren were arrested by a native ‘inskari’ (policeman) and taken before the local authority, who ordered them to be beaten up (20 lashes each) and imprisoned until such time as it pleased him to inquire into their matter. After four days, during which time they received but little food, they were brought up for questioning, and when the Portuguese official learned that they were preaching of ‘another kingdom’ he said: ‘The only kingdom here is our own and we do not want to hear of another.’ And, although he could find no fault with them, two of them were sent away to forced labor; and the remaining two shut up in gaol again. There was some talk of sending them to Beira, but they were eventually released and ‘straitly commanded not to speak in that name again’. On their release they visited this depot to receive instruction on the pioneer service and then returned home; the first two pioneers to take the field in that country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tanganyika</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tanganyika, with its population of about 10,000 Europeans and over 5,000,000 Africans, is one of those parts of earth where the message of truth has not been sounded forth to any great extent as yet. There has been an average of 227 publishers, to compare with 144 the previous year, divided into 7 companies, to compare with 3 the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this island of the sea, 1,400 miles northwest of Cape Town, there has been an average of 15 publishers during the year, with 18 as the peak for any month. They have been sending in reports for every month of the service year up to the end of July.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the older geography books there is to be found a small country on the northern eoast of South America called ‘‘Dutch Guiana”. This is Surinam. It is a hot, tropical country; and its largest city, Paramaribo, has a population of about 70,000 people. In this jungle land there is a small group of Jehovah’s witnesses anxious to make many of these people glad with Jehovah’s people. The climate is not the best, but in the New World this territory will be beautified and made a wonderful spot in which to live. To the people that live there it is “home”, and they need the Kingdom to bring them real comfort. The natives of this land speak a mixture of languages—Dutch, English, East Indian, Javanese, Chinese, and takie-takie. Dutch, however, is the national language. It is not an uncommon thing for the Surinamer to speak two or three languages, due to the great mixture of tongues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of this land want freedom, and the truth is the only thing that will make them free. The few publishers in Paramaribo have been aided by the Society’s sending Gilead graduates to that land to help them in the organization of book studies, making of back-calls, carrying on of magazine work, etc. All of this is new to the few devoted servants of the Lord in Surinam. There is much yet to be done, but in the year 1946 something was definitely started so that the work of preaching the gospel might be advanced. A graduate of Gilead was appointed Branch servant, and his first report covering a few months is quite interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For many years some brethren in Surinam have been acquainted with the truth. They have often wanted a visit from the president of the Watch Tower Society. This year their prayers were fulfilled; Brothers Knorr and Franz came last April, and for this the brethren are very thankful. Certainly this was Jehovah's provision. Brother Knorr discussed the responsibilities and privileges of service; Brother Franz spoke on the “Great Multitude&quot;. A public lecture was given, “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” by Brother Knorr. Troublesome questions had been before the Surinam brethren for many months: Who is in the “great multitude”? Should not the studies be conducted in Dutch, since Dutch is the national language? But, since the visit of Brothers Knorr and Franz these old problems have vanished and the brethren are now busy preaching “this gospel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The latest Hollandish book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kinderen,</span><span class="font4"> was received in July. A great instrument it has proved to be. The book has cleared up many doctrinal questions for the publishers. Oftentimes persons of good-will ask for this book when they see the publisher on the street. This is the first Dutch book that has been released for many years, and the publishers give thanks to the Society for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day two brethren were walking down a street to an interested person; but just before they arrived at the door a young man came running up and requested that the brethren come to his father’s home because his father wanted to see them. The brethren immediately followed the young man to his father’s home to learn what was wanted. The father had heard about a study that the brethren had begun with his relative, and he desired to see it also. The study was started, although the man had never before seen the book, and since that day the book study has continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A publisher came to a door of a lady and introduced the Society’s publications. The lady said, “For a long time I have been searching and inquiring for you people, and today you have come.’’ A study was arranged, and now she is coming to the headquarters studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are 20 publishers scattered throughout the country, in three companies. During the year 4,189 pieces of literature were placed, the publishers putting in 2,579 hours. The magazine work is just beginning. Twenty-two subscriptions have been taken, and we look forward to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign of 1947. We expect to have many more readers in this territory. At the close of the year there were seventeen book studies being conducted, mostly by pioneers; but the company publishers are being trained in this work also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new year holds before us good prospects, and we feel sure Surinam is among those that will fulfill: ‘Traise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All nations of the earth were affected by the war, but during the years of hostilities Sweden did not take sides with one or the other of the opposing factions. With the coming of the war’s end all the brethren were anxious to get in full accord with any new arrangement the Society had established. They took to heart the new organization instructions, cheerfully receiving them and putting them into operation. Every effort is being made on the part of the office in Sweden to see that all the territory is covered in the preaching of the gospel. The pioneers are doing an excellent work; so are the servants to the brethren. Not all the details of the Branch servant’s report can be set out here; but some of the high lights are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year 1944-45 having witnessed the cessation of hostilities between the nations and consequent reopening of more or less broken connections, the year just ended may well be characterized as one of concentration and preparation within the organization of the Lord's people. I think, in this connection, primarily on the visits of the Society’s president to Europe and other parts of the field and on the great international convention at Cleveland. The efforts of the latter have, of course, not yet had time to make themselves felt in this part of the world. We expect, however, a real impetus to the work by the reproduction (on a smaller scale) of that convention, which is going to take place, by the Lord’s grace, in this country October 10-13. The president’s visit to Sweden in December, on the other hand, had an immediate effect, stimulating and encouraging, on the organization here and started a work of consolidating and bringing into line witli headquarters’ policy in all details, which has been very much appreciated. Formerly we in these northern parts were, so to speak, an island of our own; and even though we reckoned that our local arrangements, which differed from the general ones to some extent, were the ones best suited to conditions, there was all the time a more or less subconscious but more and more accentuated feeling of dissatisfaction at the state of things, and a desire for closer connections with headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another marked result from the president’s visit is that the brethren in general have become more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower-</span><span class="font4">minded. This was reflected in the figures for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, where, for the first time in history, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions (i.e., new ones) outnumbered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> ones in this country, and that in spite of the fact that a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription here rates twice as higli as one for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> the latter magazine appearing only once a month. And now people even directly ask for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> when the publishers are doing street witnessing. There is no doubt that the Lord’s time is here for all the goodwill ones to get the opportunity of reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and appropriating to themselves the contents thereof. It is a real encouragement and joy to watch how the Lord is directing the editorial work of that magazine in supplying the very needs of his people just at the right time. I am now thinking specifically on the article appearing in the latest issue that has reached here, viz., that of September 1, with the article “Keeping Unspotted from the World”, which was indeed a most timely and needed admonition, especially, maybe, with regard to the warning there given concerning deportment toward the opposite sex. The demons, in this country as elsewhere, are busy trying to divert the people of God from the right path, and divorces and suchlike have nearly become an epidemic over here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An instance of religious intolerance occurred this summer when the State Church Board in a country parish decided to demand of two pioneer sisters that they (1) stop calling upon the people with their erroneous literature, and (2) should believe in the Lord Jesus, and (3) should take up their abode outside of that parish without delay. The landlord where the sisters were staying was also exhorted to immediately give them notice to quit. The case seemed to them to be finished with, and the letter wherewith the local priest sent the landlord notice of the decision made by the board was concluded by this hypocritical phrase: “With hearty greetings to you and them” (meaning the two sisters). The only result of their action, thus far, however, was that the landlord and his brother, who had both used to be regular churchgoers, became so disgusted with their action that they stopped going to church and instead started to attend the studies conducted by the sisters, whom they had found to be nice and reliable and real Christian ladies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The refugees who were brought here last year from German concentration camps have now mostly returned to their homelands, only a small number remaining for various reasons, such as sickness or impossibility of reaching their native place. The latter ones are now allowed to work for their living and thus also enabled to earn money wherewith to purchase foodstuffs, etc., which they may send to their relatives or friends at home. At the president’s direction we have made shipments of clothing to the brethren in the war-torn countries of Norway and Finland, 2, 5 and 3 tons, respectively, and individual parcels with foodstuffs to friends in German Saar Basin. Besides this help of a material kind we have had the privilege of helping the brethren in Norway with spiritual food, in that we could supply them with books for the field and until they got some literature in their own language to offer to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The method of training publishers by literally taking them along from door to door or on back-calls has been introduced and has brought good results. The servants to the brethren are making it a point to take all appointed servants in the companies along with them, thus preparing these to themselves take publishers along. In one company, where all the publishers except one are deaf and dumb, they have developed a method of looking up Scripture texts and they hand these to the public to read. In this way several interested ones have been located who have afterwards been called upon by the publisher who can talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family has had the joy of seeing one of their number going to Gilead for further training, and others are waiting for their turn. The family have been doing their respective duties with zeal and appreciation of the privilege afforded them to live and work together in the grand cause. Their spare hours have been used for field service to the extent shown in the figures here presented, to wit: Average number out every month, 19; average hours, 22.4; average number of back-calls, 6.2; and average back-call book studies, 0.5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In concluding this report I give thanks to the great eternal God, Jehovah, for his goodness and long-suffering, for his protecting care and wonderful grace toward his people in this country as all over the earth. We pray that his blessing and good spirit may continually be the portion of his people, especially so of that “faithful and wise servant”, whom he has set over all his goods; and that we all may have grace to acceptably co-operate with that servant, all to the praise of Jehovah’s great and holy name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Like Sweden, Switzerland was another neutral country during the war years. Despite neutrality the hardships that befell this nation were great. Notwithstanding this, a constant flow of new publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom came forward. There is still much “fishing” and “hunting” to be done in this land of four million inhabitants, and Jehovah’s witnesses of Switzerland want to do it. The principal opponents of the truth are the clergy, who try to use the political powers to suppress the spreading of the gospel, and therefore the publishers meet up with considerable opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the service year street magazine work was done for the first time, and this was accepted by the publishers with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Switzerland responded remarkably to the relief call. It was their good pleasure and privilege to help many of their neighbor-country workers to keep on in the field. Through the Swiss office it was possible for the Society to arrange for the purchase of food from Swiss agencies and have it forwarded into neighboring countries where such supplies were immediately needed. Furthermore, the office in Switzerland has done much to keep the Brooklyn office in communication with many of the Balkan nations, too. The Branch servant gives us a very interesting report of the work in Switzerland. Not all can be published, because of lack of space, but some of the high lights are set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a very happy surprise for us at the Branch office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society in Berne to receive a telegram from Paris at 9 a.m. on Sunday the 18th November 1945, saying that Brother Knorr and his secretary, Brother Henschel, would already reach Berne with the midday train. To be sure, the president had notified us of his visit, but only for the 4th December, and the matter of obtaining Swiss visas had still not been settled in Berne. Seven years had passed since the last time that we had been able to have personal contact with a brother from headquarters of Jehovah’s work on earth. Hence many things had heaped up that had to be discussed with the president of the Society in order that the work of proclamation might receive new impetus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A provision of our president which was greeted with joy and gratitude was that from the 1st January 1946 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> could appear again in Switzerland twice a month as before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">big campaign with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> of the loth June brought </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Swiss authorities to a knowledge of the intrepid attitude of the Lord’s people in the totalitarian states. On this occasion 34,409 copies of this issue were sent to the clergy, to teaching professions, to all editors, to town councilors and judges and to the federal authorities of the country. The echo was most pleasing, and various communications reached us in which not only was appreciation expressed for the copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> received, but also sympathy for the fight that Jehovah’s witnesses have waged in Nazi and Fascist countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the frontier city of Basle we seized the opportunity on the occasion of the annual Commercial Fair, which was visited by several hundred thousand people, of giving a witness with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> particularly along the largest thoroughfares leading to the Fair building. Every 30 meters brethren stood either singly or in groups of four. Their appearance created quite a stir and thousands of Swiss and foreign visitors received in this way an effective witness of Jehovah’s kingdom. A total of 1,175 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were placed by 100 publishers in two Saturday afternoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the past service year we registered only 21 legal cases This is the lowest figure that we have had for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seventeen cases are based on the Pedler’s or Businesstravelers Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two cases on disturbance of religious peace ($261 Swiss Penal Code).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two cases for alleged molestation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of these 21 cases, 13 are still pending; 6 were dropped, and 2 were decided in our favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of special interest is the judgment of the Swiss Federal Court of the 18th March 1940 against the cantonal government of Zug. This is now the second time that the Supreme Court of the country has decided against the local government of Zug. In both cases it hud to do with a ban upon a public lecture of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the above-mentioned decision we quote the following paragraphs, which are worthy of notice;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Cantonal Government of Zug has not endeavored to substantiate its assertion that the public lecture activity of Jehovah’s witnesses can easily lead to disturbance of religious peace, either In their decision of the 17th October 1945 and 9th January 1946, or in the statement to their present complaint. Especially has it omitted to cite passages from the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses distributed in the last years, or statements from lectures, from which this conclusion could be drawn. It seems to be of the opinion that it is just an established fact which needs no motivation. This, however, is not so . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Regarding the contents of the lecture fixed for the 11th June 1946 and banned by the Cantonal Government of Zug, the complainants have given information by submitting the manuscript. As the Cantonal Government has abstained from objecting to any one statement in this lecture there is no occasion for the Supreme Court to go further into this. Be it solely remarked that the position taken therein toward the attitude of the Christian churches in World War II has not overstepped the limits of allowed criticism pertaining to religious matters. This lecture has been given in various parts of Switzerland without disturbance in any way to public order or the religious peace, which fact is not disputed by the Cantonal Government. That it should have a different effect upon the population of the Canton of Zug is improbable and not to be assumed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Jehovah’s witnesses do not interfere in the fight for power of the political parties, but only lay claim to the right to disseminate Biblical truths publicly, truths too regarding the Roman Church and its erroneous doctrines and worldly methods of fighting, the reproach that they disturb religious peace is wholly unfounded. And it deserves recognition that the Federal Court protects the freedom of the proclamation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally a “wrestle” was won with the police department in the canton of Solothurn. This police department had the curious practice, or better called, illegal impudence, to simply confiscate the literature of Jehovah's witnesses while these engaged in their divine worship from house to house and then without legal verdict to keep it and even to destroy it. Our repeated protests were simply ignored by the police authorities, and so we were forced to enter complaint with tlie cantonal government. It took a whole year until the cantonal government could come to a decision. Our complaint was then supported and the police department was instructed to return the confiscated literature and to reimburse the value of that literature already destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The police control of our public meetings, mentioned on page 200 of the English 1946 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font4"> has also been withdrawn and so we rejoice in the freedom from this last unfair restriction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The authorities of the country are learning to know us still better, and it is becoming clearer to them that Jehovah’s witnesses are courageous fighters for Jehovah’s New World of righteousness. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy may think differently; that can be seen from their unsound, indeed, untruthful press articles against Jehovah’s witnesses. But what avails it them to fight against Jehovah God and his kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Production. It is indeed a cause for rejoicing that the fall in production in our factory caused by the second world war has now been replaced by a new period. The machines are rustling again and singing the song of activity. With tile opening of the frontiers, our production figures have mounted up again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year our publications w’ere printed in six different languages, namely, German, French, Italian, Slovenian, Croatian and Hollandish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The manufactured literature was sent for the main part to the following countries:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Belgium, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Canada, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Yugoslavia, Haiti, Uruguay, and Denmark, The production figures are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Relief Campaign. When we heard of the steadfastness of our faithful fellow fighters In Germany, our hearts overflowed with fervent love and sympathy, and when then the news reached us of the distressing circumstances of these courageous and faithful witnesses of Jehovah as they emerged from the concentration camps in the liberated regions of Europe, we organized a campaign of relief In the sense and spirit of the early Christian communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sixty-six cases were necessary to contain all the gifts of clothing sent in. The whole consignment had a net weight of 4,103 kilograms. (Gross weight 5,507 kg.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to this gift of clothing, a sum of 20,000.-Swiss francs was also contributed, which was used to purchase a consignment of food conveyed through the intermediary of the Red Cross to the suffering in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A further consignment of clothing was also collected for Hungary. This consisted of 42 cases, weighing 3,924 kilograms gross weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For Austria It has been possible for us to supply spiritual help. We had sufficient paper at our disposal to be able to print 80,000 booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and 70,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples&quot;</span><span class="font4"> for the brethren and friends there. The president has arranged that this literature shall be given as a gift towards the proclamation work In Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The import license has also been received at last by the Wiesbaden Office (Germany) for a consignment of literature which we have had in readiness for some time for Germany. This consists of 20,921 books, 43,800 booklets and 20,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are many people in this small country being made glad with Jehovah’s chosen people. A year ago the average number of publishers in the field was 33; now this has increased to 91, with a peak of 144 publishers during one month. This is marvelous in our eyes. The good work that has been accomplished is due mainly to the Society’s effort in sending graduates from the Bible School to Uruguay. The servant to the brethren is a graduate of the first class, and he has done excellent work in visiting the companies. The whole organization in Uruguay is healthy, anxious to advance the Kingdom interests, and working in a peaceful manner. Their zeal is observed by the inhabitants of Uruguay and it is expected that many more will be made glad and will praise Jehovah. The report of the Branch servant is very heartening and parts of it are published in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the last service year in September we had three companies organized throughout tlie country, and now there are ten. These are companies established with those who had had contact with the truth through literature that had been placed by the pioneers over a period of many years. In one instance a brother who lives some tiiirty miles from Montevideo borrowed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> book from a Methodist friend. He read it and liked it so much that he wanted to copy the entire book before giving it back to his friend. He saw that was too much work, so he came to Montevideo and looked through all the used-book stores to find another book like it, but all in vain. Finally he asked a lawyer friend of his where he could get a book like it. He was directed to another used-book store and there he found another copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> book along with some others with the Society’s address in them. He searched out the brethren in Montevideo and began talking with his family and friends and now there is in the small town of Saurez a little company of ten publishers. The servant to the brethren has helped such interested groups as this to become organized as companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a wonderful increase in company publishers, our peak last year in August being 45 and this year in July the peak was 113. This has been the result of back-call book studies, especially by the pioneers and special publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the service year the Society assigned 16 more special publishers from Gilead to work in Uruguay, and these arrived in groups of from two to five over a period of months from October, when four arrived in the first part of the month, to April, when the last two arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Gilead graduates have progressed very well in learning the Spanish language even to the extent of now teaching Uruguayans how to read and thus learn the truth. One of the most enthusiastic company publishers we now have was a person of good-will who couldn’t read when one of these publishers arrived at her door. However, she took the book anyway and after several back-calls a study was started. Long before this person could read she was enthusiastically taking part regularly in the field service. We can certainly see from some of these experiences that it is the Lord’s due time to take the message to these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another instance some Interest was shown after reading the Scriptures concerning the Kingdom blessings but no literature was placed. However, the publisher was invited back. After some half a dozen attempts to make the back-call and always finding nobody but a young lady who said she lived in the apartment alone, the publisher decided to wait for some time before going back again. Several weeks later Maria, the interested person, appeared at the Kingdom Hall and was glad to have another opportunity to talk to the publisher and attend the study. Just after the first call the numbers on the apartments were changed and it was impossible for the publisher to contact Maria again, but now she has a regular study in her home and attends all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoi&amp;er</span><span class="font4"> studies at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the Montevideo police stationed near one of the Society’s missionary homes saw the publishers going and coining each day and wondered what they were doing. One day he asked Nola Cantwell and she explained the work and arranged to deliver a book at his home. A few back-calls were made, with the result that he left the Adventist church, comes regularly to the studies at the Kingdom Hall and takes part In the back-call work himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie first servant to the brethren in Uruguay was sent out immediately after the first series of public meetings in March of this year to visit the brethren in the interior. Arrangements were made for extended visits with several of the groups of publishers who had up to this time been sending their reports directly to the Branch office. Help was given to establish them as companies. Also he visited </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers and other isolated persons on his tour of tlie country. The brethren were greatly benefited by this arrangement. In one city alone, which had been reporting 8 and 9 publishers during the month of the visit by the servant to the brethren, the company is now reporting 30 publishers. The brethren were greatly aided to know what they were supposed to do with the truth after learning it. Seven companies were organized according to organization instructions, making the total in the country at the present time ten. All companies in the country have now had two visits by the servant to the brethren. A great increase has been the result both in the interior and in Montevideo itself. During the visit by the servant to the brethren to Montevideo, the company was reorganized and book studies were established throughout the city, which have proved to be an aid to company publishers’ regular activity in the service and are now being used as places to hold public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twenty-one public meetings were held during 1946, to be compared with three the year before. We began with a series of lectures In the Kingdom Hall and as many as 150 attended. Some meetings were held by the servant to the brethren in smaller cities and in the city squares with an attendance of as many as 180. Sound equipment was used in such open-air meetings. Another series of lectures was arranged for in the Ateneo of Montevideo. We have used the radio every week for fifteen minutes, and a good witness has thus been given. Many people mention the radio programs to us in the field service. Some have also been directed to the Society’s offices to receive literature because of these programs on the radio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Uruguayan must be talked to. He will not fall for something without Investigating it thoroughly and being convinced of its veracity. He has been fooled badly by the Roman Catholic church and doesn’t want the same thing to happen with something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much talking has been done in the past twelve months but, by the Lord’s grace, much more will be done during the coming service year to “enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes”. All this to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Nigeria and the Gold Coast have much to be thankful for now. While they have never been forsaken for want of “meat in due season”, the brethren were working under difficult circumstances because of the ban barring all literature setting forth the truths concerning the Kingdom. This ban was rescinded during the year and such has given cause for much rejoicing. However, the brethren were always able to meet together to study their Bibles, to preach, and to have assemblies; but now they feel that they have a greater part in the reconstruction work going forward throughout the whole world. The report from the Branch servant of West Africa is interesting, and portions of it are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early this year information was received from headquarters that in some parts of the Caribbean success was achieved as a result of a Petition signed by the general public appealing on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses. We decided to follow suit, not only by circulating a petition but also by getting a few honorable members of the Legislative Council to take up the matter at a meeting which was due to be held on March 18, 1946. Four members agreed to our request, among whom was an Anglican clergyman, the Honorable Venerable Archdeacon Lennon, and a Moslem, the Honorable Dr. Ibiyinka Olorun-Nimbe, who presented the petition to the governor in council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had barely a fortnight to get matters through, but the brethren worked hard and were privileged to secure over 10,000 signatures of the educated class. The authorities were not asleep while this activity was In progress, as will be seen by the fact that the commissioner of police sent for the Branch servant, who was queried thus: ‘‘Why did you send your men to the police barracks to secure signatures for your petition? Didn’t you know it was against the law?” The Branch servant replied that he sent no one, but they acted on their own initiative. After a long discussion the officer admitted that his men too were ignorant of the law in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five influential members of the community sponsored the cause by forwarding the petition to the authorities. It was a heart-cheering campaign, as the intelligent public were enthusiastic and on our side of the Issue. The authorities were astonished to see the names of almost all the leading citizens, among whom were doctors, magistrates, lawyers, chiefs and government officials of all departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After two months of waiting, the ban was rescinded, to the joy of the brethren and the general public, who cheered us wherever we went. The news was gazetted by the government on May 18, 1946, and on the following morning the local press blazed it out in bold headlines, at the same time making appropriate remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not many days after the great victory we were requested to call at the Nigerian Secretariat storeroom to take delivery of 284 cartons containing books and booklets that were held up by the government since 1940. The bulk of literature, totaling 116,000, besides a few hundred records, was committed to the flames in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr had promised that as soon as the way was clear he would flood West Africa with literature; and, true to his promise, the first consignment of the latest publications arrived early this month. The literature is going out like hot loaves. The brethren are busy at it, and the response is indeed gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Words can hardly express our joy of being privileged onee more to be receiving </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> without let or hindrance. We appreciate the rich food the Lord is so graciously providing for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our public meetings are going ahead in English and in vernaculars. We lack capable English speakers. However, the few available ones are made use of. The Theocratic ministry course has helped a great deal. It is interesting to hear some who were dull in giving the witness now doing so in an intelligent manner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gold Coast</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work In this country has not progressed as it should. Many factors are responsible for this, among which may be mentioned the fact that the Branch servant is still barred from entering there. He has again appealed to the authorities for permission to enter the country and negotiations are still under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two of the brethren from this country visited Nigeria in December 1945 to attend the service assembly held in Abeokuta. They were greatly impressed as to how the work is carried on In Nigeria, and returned to their destination with a greater determination to see that the work on the Gold Coast goes on In real earnest while awaiting the arrival of their fellow workers from Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing that the ban on all Watch Tower publications has been lifted in Nigeria as a result of the petition, the friends have taken similar steps and are doing their utmost to see the matter through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are 284 brethren working In the Gold Coast, and they placed 2,156 pieces of literature. They devoted 48,221 hours to the field. The number of publishers and the hours devoted to the work have decreased compared with the figures of last year. There are 33 companies organized, and the faithful brethren are pushing on with the work. It is felt that as soon as certain restrictions are lifted from these brethren greater activity will be shown. It Is really hard to work without all the Instruments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Great is the distress of Jehovah’s witnesses in this land. It is impossible for our brethren there to say that conditions have changed for the better since the end of the war. God’s people are still fighting vigorously for their freedom, putting forth every effort to preach the gospel. As yet the Society is not recognized by the local regime governing the land, although due application has been made to the minister of interior and prime minister for such. The command rings clear in the hearts and minds of Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached”; so onward they go, gladly proclaiming the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren rejoiced to hear of the great expansion going on throughout the rest of the earth. They desire to have a share in this in their own territory and are depending on their “strong tower” to guide and direct them. Here, too, there are people who will praise Jehovah among all nations. The Branch servant, who has been continually subjected to trials and difficulties, writes as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our country has been greatly impoverished by war and occupation, and many brethren have not even the most necessary clothing to cover themselves. With deep joy therefore we received the news that our brethren in America had also collected used garments for us. Unfortunately wo have not yet been successful in obtaining the import license for this. We are making every effort and hope to receive same before the winter months. We express our thanks in advance for these gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the Constitution, our country also received a new public press law, which appears very democratic.. The practical application of it, however, is such that it is impossible to print anything that does not bear the party color. At the moment the paper rationing is used as a pretext, although there is quite enough paper. All printing houses have passed into the possession of the State and only small establishments that are working with the “Tiegel” (small job press) are still in private hands. If one wants to print anything, then it is necessary to procure paper from the ministry of industries, that is, procure the permit to buy paper. Moreover the complete manuscript must be submitted &quot;in order to calculate the amount of paper”. Then the permit is issued. We have therefore great difficulties in procuring paper for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> which we produce ourselves on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gestettner,</span><span class="font4"> and in addition this is an expensive method. We have not been able to have anything printed to date principally because our official registration has not yet been confirmed by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nevertheless, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has appeared pretty regularly in Croatian and Slovenian to the amount of 700 copies per issue; to date 20 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> numbers. Additionally the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> was prepared in both languages each month, also numbering 700 copies. Three circulars were likewise duplicated, one regarding the reorganization of the companies, one about the persecutions, and the third concerning the management of the work in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In various regions of Yugoslavia a number of brothers were arrested during this service year. The Branch servant was released in November 1945 from prison where he had spent a full 5 months. Two brothers who serve the companies in Slovenia were also retained in prison for 32 days, being accused as reactionaries by the street-committee, but were acquitted by the court, where they were able to deliver a marvelous witness. A third brother was pushed over the border into Austria after 5 weeks’ arrest, although he is a Slovene, and everything in his flat was confiscated; the Society has fruitlessly intervened for the pieces of furniture which were of American property. A large number of brothers were held in confinement for a few days only, and just one brother for a day. Nevertheless the faithful remained steadfast and Jehovah gave through them a still more powerful witness, with the result that today the authorities know Jehovah’s witnesses better than ever before.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“Blessed are the peacemakers,” for these have followed the direction of the great Peacemaker, Jehovah God. His witnesses world-wide have sought diligently to know God’s purposes, and the Almighty One of the universe has revealed his will and given to them knowledge and wisdom. Understanding his purposes and being anxious to do his bidding, they have gone forward during the service year 1946 with real vigor, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God which will bring peace and prosperity to all those who love righteousness. These have gotten on with their neighbors and have shown love for their neighbors by pushing ahead with the great reconstruction and expansion work. Even though the whole world was engulfed in war and is now struggling with peace, Jehovah’s witnesses have not ceased their peaceful pursuit; but, by the Lord’s grace, they are accomplishing great things in the expanding of the Kingdom interests and restoring in the earth the true worship of the Most High. What a joy is theirs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report you have just read shows that they have not slacked their hand during the war years, nor in the first postwar year; nor will they relax from their labors during the years the nations try to establish world peace. The Lord’s servants are commanded by the Most High to be “peacemakers”, and these they will be regardless of the world conspiracy to ignore the Kingdom and in its stead set up “one world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These lovers of peace were maltreated in all nations since 1939, imprisoned, driven underground, some even killed. But as soon as they were freed from the concentration camps and the grip of oppressor nations, wherein they ceased not to preach the gospel, they immediately set themselves to the task of talking 252 to the people in the homes, offices, anywhere, just so they could carry out their covenant to the full. Jehovah’s witnesses were not and are not disheartened. The property of Jehovah’s witnesses has been regained and renovated in Germany, Canada, Australia, Poland, and many other countries. The servants of God in all lands are reorganized and have set their hands to good reconstruction works. The reports from the Branch servants show the onward march of the “peacemakers” in all nations. Yes, Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland were trodden under foot! But what happens ? Polish witnesses show great zeal for the expansion of the work in their land; and not only there, for now they have entered into Russia in great numbers. Read any part of the report—South America, Central America, Africa, Asia—and see the great expansion work moving forward. Those interested in this reconstruction activity have only one thing in mind; that is, the glorification of Jehovah’s name and word and the advancing of the Kingdom interests. Love for their God and their neighbor above everything else is the motivating power, backed up by God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This expression of love is proved by works. Gifts have been sent to many of their brethren in numerous nations of the earth in the way of food and clothing, so that the Lord’s people might be better equipped physically to take the message to the people of the earth. Upward of $300,000.00 was contributed in money and clothing by the brethren in different parts of the earth to assist their fellow workers in other parts where famine was rampant and shelter and clothing lacking. It was because of the “unspeakable gift” which God has graciously bestowed upon his servants that his people react in this unselfish manner toward their brethren. It is love that exists within God’s organization visible; and because of this love peace reigns and the “peacemakers” march forward preaching the good news. Not only has great assistance been given in the way of material things, but even greater in the spiritual comforts which are so necessary. The Lord’s organization has seen to it that food convenient in all languages has been sent unto the ends of the earth, to comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Missionaries were sent with good spiritual food during the past year into many fields which formerly had not been worked. The Society spent upward of $125,000.00 for expansion work throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean area. Eighteen different countries in this part of the earth received this assistance, so that the good news of the Kingdom might be preached. The appreciation of this generous gift is shown in the reports of the Spanish-speaking countries of Central and South America and the English-speaking witnesses on the islands of the Caribbean. So that the great expansion work of Jehovah’s organization might be carried forward in other lands, Jehovah’s witnesses have also contributed generously to the countries of Belgium, Italy, Netherlands and Newfoundland, where the brethren have benefited to the extent of $100,000.00 in gifts in the form of Branch homes, equipment and literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year 1946 finds the Lord’s people moving into many lands, as God’s spirit directs. They now have set up Branch organizations in 57 countries, whereas in 1939 there were only 35 branches. The war bans, hindrances and trouble world-wide did not slacken the hand of Jehovah’s witnesses; but during these terrible years when peace was removed violently from the earth the “peacemakers” of God have pressed on to make glad all the nations. This continual moving forward as God directs is indeed the proper course for Jehovah’s witnesses to take. War years are not the time to sit back and wait until the nations are done fighting; but whether there is peace or war among the nations of the earth, Jehovah’s witnesses say: “Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel,” <sup>f</sup>in season and out of season.’ God’s servants are active day and night singing his praises in the temple. So, Onward! has been their watchword. In 1939 there were 71,509 publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom, and onward they went, under the blessing of the Lord. Now there are 158,034 reported publishers proclaiming far and wide the good news of God’s glorious New World. It is almost unbelievable that in seven years’ time there should be more than 100 percent increase in the average number of publishers singing the good news of the Kingdom every month. Surely Jehovah’s witnesses’ welcome call, “Be glad, ye nations, with his people,” has been heeded. They have heard, and now these are going forward with the gladsome message, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only has there been an average of 158,034 publishers praising Jehovah among all the nations of the world, but before the year 1946 had ended a new peak was established among servants of the King, reaching a new all-time high mark of 176,456 proclaimers of the good news. What joy it brings to all of us to know that many have taken their stand as ministers of God from the nations of the earth, joining the ranks of the “peacemakers” and expressing their love toward their neighbor by bringing them the good news! “The Prince of Peace” at the temple is guiding and directing his people and is gathering together his “other sheep” for a very definite purpose. The carrying forward of this grand news of the Kingdom right on down to the battle of Armageddon will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reconstruction and expansion work of Jehovah’s witnesses is not complete. The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead was started just a few years ago, and its effects are being felt world-wide. As the years go on the graduates of this school will reach out into all nations to carry on the good work which has already been started. Additionally, all publishers of the Kingdom receive weekly training in the company organizations through the course in Theocratic min-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">istry, the service meetings and the study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> This is equipping the ministers of the Most High for every good work of their future service. The work of expansion moves on! A few years ago there were 5,232 companies; but in the service year 1946 we find that the company organizations world-wide have increased to 9,597. The same good training of peaceful ministers will continue in all these companies; and as new fields are opened more organizations will be built up, and the call will go forth, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine continues to reach out in many languages unto the ends of the earth; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> will send out its clarion call for people to arouse themselves and heed the message of the Kingdom. The books and booklets in all languages will be studied by the people. During the service year 1946 Jehovah’s witnesses had the privilege of distributing 24,924,413 books and booklets. This brings the total distribution of volumes containing the message of the Kingdom for home study up to 492,724,712 publications. What a witness has been given since the year 1920! In addition to this, magazines of the Society are offered to the people on the highways and byways and in the homes, and more than 12,000,000 copies were distributed to individuals in addition to the 514,814 new subscriptions world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are ready to assist and aid all readers to an understanding of this literature. What has been accomplished in the 1946 service year is just a small indication of what will be done in the years to come under the leadership of “The Prince of Peace” as 158,034 regular publishers march forward as a peaceful army serving the peoples of the world. The real “peacemakers” in the world spent 38,284,007 hours preaching the good news of the Kingdom. This is 10,000,000 more hours spent in talking the good news of the Kingdom than were devoted to the preaching of the gospel in 1942. Back in 1939 the 71,509 pubUshers made 1,742,264 back-calls on interested people; but today, seven years later, this faithful group of servants of the Most High in the past twelve months have made 10,001,583 back-calls on those showing interest in the Kingdom. Yes, the people of good-will are being given the invitation “Praise Jehovah, all ye nations”. There has been a constant increase in the number of book studies too. A new high of 106,885 weekly book studies have been conducted throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses cannot relax now and be content with their past accomplishments. There is too much work to be done! The Society, at the expressed wish of the conventioners at the Glad Nations Assembly, is moving ahead with the greatest expansion program ever arranged. This not only includes the construction of a new Bethel home, a factory to take care of the increase in printing, a new radio station, new Branch offices throughout the world wherever needed, and the advancing of missionary work, but it also means making room throughout all the world to care for and welcome within the organization thousands of people who are being invited to “be glad” with his chosen people. To this end the Society announced the work of the newly organized circuits and the district work in the entire world. The expansion program is on, and it is for the welcoming of all those that will praise Jehovah out of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To observe the loyalty, the faithfulness, and the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide brings joy to the hearts of all the servants of the Most High, for we know “God is with us”. The expansion work under his direction will be carried on in every nook and corner, by every individual publisher, by every company, by every Branch, by the Lord’s people worldwide. They will look to their “Prince of Peace” to guide them and care for them in times of stress and trial. They rejoice that they can bear the sufferings that are left behind, carrying on the peaceful mission of their Master of making glad the nations with His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is indeed a pleasure to submit this report to Jehovah’s faithful witnesses world-wide and to join with you as just one of the builders in the reconstruction work and in this grand expansion activity of the Lord’s people under the direction of the great Peacemaker, Jehovah God, and his beloved Son “The Prince of Peace”. It is with much love to all of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide and with great joy that I bring this service year’s report to a close.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">According to the charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the annual meeting of the Society was called for October 1, 1946. Those associated with this Pennsylvania corporation, which is devoted to the advancement of the Kingdom interests, assembled at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for its usual annual business. The members elected two directors to fill vacancies of terms that expired. The two former directors were re-elected, namely, T. J. Sullivan and Grant Suiter. Reports were then made by members present. A brief survey of the work of the Society was given by the president. The meeting was a joyful occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly thereafter, when all the directors of the Society were able to meet together, namely, on October 16, 1946, they had a meeting in the president’s office at Brooklyn Bethel for the election of officers. By unanimous vote on the part of the directors all former officers were re-elected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations” —Psalm 117:1, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a welcome sound and song! If all the nations did this from their heart, then peace would come to the earth. But now peace and gladness come only to those who truly do praise Jehovah from all the nations. The servants of the Most High know that all who will ever gain life must praise him; and those who do so now fully appreciate the merciful kindness of the great God toward his people in the earth. They appreciate, too, the truth of the Lord, which endures forever. God sets forth his principles of truth and righteousness, and persons who follow them can be absolutely certain that they will lead to life eternal. There is no variance or turning as to God’s word, for his word is truth. This comes as a great comfort and as welcome water to parched ground. The people of the earth today are as dry as parched ground. They have been lied to by all the political powers of the world. There is no truth in these. How could there be? A parched, dry throat cannot sing praises. He needs the life-giving water of truth to sing “Oh praise Jehovah”. Give it to him.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark204"></a><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have the grandest work in all the world—going forward unto nations 260 with the water of truth for all tongues and inviting them to ‘praise the Lord, all ye nations’. Those who accept will receive of Jehovah’s merciful kindness, which is great toward all them that love the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses, under the guidance of “The Prince of Peace”, seeking to praise the only Peacemaker, the One who will bring peace for a certainty, have the opportunity in this day to praise Jehovah and invite others to do the same. This they have done. This they will continue to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Welcome are all ye nations to praise Jehovah ! His witnesses are charged to teach the people the truth, and when once the people know the truth and believe it they will love their God in heaven and their neighbor and will forever praise Jehovah. One should not relax and say, “Well, that day will come in the New World and I will wait for it.” No; that day is here now when the nations of the earth are invited to praise Jehovah. Individually, the people can receive it or reject it. There are millions that will receive this good news; and there are more millions who will reject it. Jehovah in his loving-kindness has been good to those who have come to a knowledge of the truth, and they know that their God endures forever. Just as long as he will endure, which is for an eternity, the servant of the Most High has the glorious pleasure of praising him; for to know Jehovah the great Peacemaker and his Son, “The Prince of Peace,” means life eternal. The lovers of peace, the lovers of truth, the lovers of righteousness in the earth today, will, by the Lord’s grace, press on with greater zeal than ever before, heralding this glad message far and wide. They will join Zion in extending the cords of her tents; they will make it possible for all people of good-will to come unto the Lord’s organization; they will expand their activity to take in all nations, all peoples, all tongues, for they accept it as a command and privilege from their Father in heaven to now sing the good song, the cheerful song, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Keep himself unspotted from the world.—Jas. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one should think his taking part in preaching activities in the field completes a clear, clean record for him in God’s sight and that, in off-times, when he is not engaging in field activities, he can be excused for imitating, copying, fellowshiping with or hanging close around the fringe of this world, for selfish pleasure. This world is dominated by unseen demons and by commerce, politics and religion. It is unclean and filthy in God’s sight and is His irreformable enemy and the enemy of all Christians who give allegiance to His kingdom. Hence, to admire the world and find pleasure in its doings and seek friendly acquaintance with it means one’s going over to God’s enemy and committing an unfriendly act toward God. It denotes indulging in spiritual fornication or adultery. It means compromise and results in lukewarmness. Neither God nor Christ wants a lukewarm one.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah . . . said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.—Gen. 17:1,</span><span class="font5"> A.SLV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now Abraham had inherited sin and imperfection from Adam. Hence God did not mean and demand that he must be absolutely sinless and never make a mistake. God knew that was an impossibility for Abraham. So God continued to accept from him sacrifices on the altar which were offered in confession of his sin and his need of a perfect sacrifice for sins. Hence the perfection that God commanded of him was that he be entire and complete in his faith in God Almighty and that he be wholly given over to serving and obeying God and following his leadings. His heart and mind must never incline to or compromise with the false gods of the heathen. He must never go back on the covenant into which he entered with God, by going back to the world out of which God once led him. Also he must teach and lead his seed or offspring in faith and obedience toward God and his promises. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He that enter eth not by the door into the sheepfold ... is a thief and a robber.—John 10:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fold must be God’s arrangement by the Abra-hamie covenant. Those entering it are justified through faith unto life eternal and are made the spiritual sons of God. Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, saying : “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Since Abraham was a human symbol of God, this Abra-hamie covenant was simply declaring that in Jehovah God as the Greater Abraham all earthly families would be blessed in due time. It is really a Kingdom covenant. It has to do with the King or Seed of God’s kingdom through whom all families and nations are to be blessed. This fold of the Abrahamie covenant arrangement accommodates only a “little flock”, those to whom it is the heavenly Father’s good pleasure to give the Kingdom as joint-heirs with Christ, the Seed of the Greater Abraham.

<p><span class="font5">Behold the blessings that come through the Messiah! Finishing and restraining transgression and making an end of sins means canceling transgression and sin for those who would manifest a faith in Messiah and in the benefits of his cutting off in death. By the Mosaic law Daniel’s people did not gain justification to eternal life. To the contrary, the law exposed them all as sinners and condemned them as such and brought upon them a curse as upon covenant-breakers. But where sin abounded as exposed by Moses’ law, God’s mercy and favor abounded much more through his Messiah. By Messiah’s death on the tree the law covenant with its power to condemn was taken out of the way, and by the merit of his self-sacrifice transgression and sins of the repentant sinners can be canceled and the penalty thereof can be restrained. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who are of Christ and who, as sueh, are members of his body, are the children of God by faith in his Son Jesus Christ. Hence they look to the human Abraham and Sarah of thirty-eight centuries ago from a special standpoint. Abraham was a type of the great living Father, Jehovah.

The remnant of such Christians are now distinguished by Jehovah’s name upon them and who are well-known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. These, then, are the ones whom the prophecy exhorts to look to father Abraham and mother Sarah, that is, to Jehovah and his heavenly universal organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

For publicity his news releases do not need and do not find it indispensable to use the motion-picture screen, the great newspapers and magazines, the far-strung radio chains, and the globe-circling news-gathering agencies, all under commercial or government ownership and control and all jealously watched and guarded by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. For spreading his good news Jehovah has his own exclusive means of publication, which is most effective in reaching as many persons as he pleases. He has his own publishing organization and his own set of publishers, the Chief of whom is his own Son, “the faithful and true witness,” Christ Jesus. This One leads. His fellow publishers copy him.

There is only one alternative, only one escape from consecration to selfish things, and that is consecration to the Lord God. This narrow choice between just two powers and two kinds of service is not a theory invented by some religionist or philosopher. It is the hard truth uttered by the great Preacher of the “sermon on the mount”. If one serves worldly goods, he will love, hold to and be consecrated to the one that is the master of such goods; no, not just some financial, commercial or industrial employer, but the “prince of this world”. Because that one is Satan the Devil, the only other choice left open is that of consecration to Jehovah God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

Satan the Devil is the god of this present worldliness, which means that he is the mighty invisible one who is back of this world and its corruptness. Jehovah God is not responsible for this world and its wickedness and oppressions. Being holy, he is absolutely detached from this world. After having let the Devil operate this world only long enough to bring the great issue to a head concerning who shall dominate the universe, Almighty God will demonstrate his holiness by utterly destroying this world and setting up the everlasting new world of truth and righteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

Warning that a selfish person goes into such soul destruction, Jesus said: “What doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his own soul? Or what exchange shall a man give for his soul?” (Matt. 16: 26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5"> Losing one’s soul means losing all right, all opportunity, all privilege or possibility for soul existence in the future new world.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s covenant with David for the kingdom has never been called back or blotted out. It holds good now, in 1947. The great Son of David, with a view to whom the kingdom covenant was made with David, has become the everlasting Heir of the covenant. That one is Christ Jesus, a royal descendant of King David according to his human birth. (Luke 1: 30-33) Hence in his manhood, Christ Jesus, being anointed with God’s spirit, went about among the Jews preaching: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Lest he should prove to be the real heir of Jehovah’s covenant, Satan the Devil had him put to death by the very ones claiming to be the “children of the kingdom”. (Matt. 21:43) When Almighty God raised him to life, then He confirmed to him the Kingdom covenant. To prove this, Paul said: “And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, ... he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.”—Acts 13:34.

From and after 1918 the remnant of spiritual Israelites who are Jehovah’s witnesses take up the world-wide call. They do so under the leadership of Jehovah’s “Messenger”, the Messiah, who has come to the temple for judgment. Before him all nations today are gathered to be judged on the test issue of world domination. Those who choose Messiah, the glorified Jesus, are gathered to his right side as “sheep”. Those who oppose his Messianic government, selecting instead the political schemes of this world, are put to his left side in disfavor as “goats”. Destruction awaits these at Armageddon. It is in this judgment time that Psalm 117:1 has its major and final fulfillment, for the Messiah is the principal witness of Jehovah and leads in praising him.

Due to David’s faithfulness to the right worship of the true and living God, Jehovah made a covenant with him for the everlasting kingdom. King David was only a visible human shepherd, but he represented the real Owner and Shepherd of the national flock, namely, the Lord God, whom David worshiped. When sitting on the throne on Mount Zion David was said to sit upon God’s throne, and his successor was said to sit “on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father”. Being just a man of flesh and blood, David could not sit upon the throne at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven. However, he pictured Christ Jesus who should do so in God’s appointed time.

There is nothing with which to find fault about him; there is nothing lacking about him. It is only man’s shortsightedness and his ignorance and the twisted teachings of religion that cause suffering humankind to complain against Him in misunderstanding and to hurl false accusations against Him. He believes in perfection. Therefore his purpose, which he has declared and from which he will not change, is to set up a new world. This righteous world which he is now about to create without help from politics, commerce, human science and religion, will be one of perfection. For that reason he will borrow nothing from fallen men. Jehovah will “make all things new” and will not be indebted to men for anything.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is interested in the sheep'. He is the Great Shepherd over them, and is their Owner, being their Creator. All humanity are likened to sheep, but in a lost condition. The prophet Isaiah uses this likeness when he foretells that Jehovah the Great Shepherd would show mercy and bring the “sheep” back to him, saying: “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.” (Isa. 53:6, A.S.7.) The merciful arrangement to accomplish this is through Jehovah’s Messiah, Christ Jesus, upon whom Jehovah lays the iniquity of the sheep, who are recovered. These return to Jehovah, their Shepherd and Overseer, and become His flock; and to men like himself who had some care over the flock Peter writes: “Be shepherds of the flock of God.”—1 Pet. 5:2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The pure and undefiled worship of God requires without omission our exercising mercy, even to the most helpless and needy ones such as the afflicted widows and orphans or bereaved ones. Let no religionist who is merciless deceive himself in this matter. “For the merciless will be mercilessly judged; but mercy will triumph over judgment.” (2:13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer.

Let this be so, not only as they visit, help and care for the afflicted widows and orphans and bereaved ones among themselves, but as they go forth publicly and from house to house with God’s message of the Kingdom and visit all without discrimination, not just the few rich, but also the many poor, including the widows, orphans and bereaved ones of this world.

<p><span class="font5">Paul spoke of religious Jerusalem in Palestine as “Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children”. Hence the religion-bound Jews of his day needed deliverance from the Greater Babylon, which Babylon is the mother of religion in opposition to God and his Son. Such needed deliverance came to all Jews who followed Christ Jesus, the true Son of God. Following his word and continuing in it, they were made free and delivered from the Greater Babylon that is exposed by Jesus in Revelation, chapters 17 and 18. All Gentiles, steeped in religion of the pagan nations, were also in bondage to the Greater Babylon. But such Gentiles as believed the message of truth and followed the Truth-teller, Christ Jesus, were made free and delivered from Babylon and were made a part of the genuine “Israel of God”.

Individual members of the organization may go wrong, being attracted to the sour, death-dealing grapes of religion’s counterfeit kingdom of God and its “new world made with human hands”; but eating such grapes will painfully sensitize only their own teeth. They only will be the ones to suffer death at God’s hands for their unfaithfulness and not keeping integrity. But the Theocratic organization of the remnant will continue to live on, enjoying God’s approval, announcing his kingdom, and declaring the purposes for which his name stands.

<p><span class="font5">After Jesus’ agreement to do his Father’s will, at Jordan, God brought him forth as his spiritual Son and he was now a new creature. In order to be ordained as the underpriests of the royal priesthood, his footstep followers must be conformed to their High Priest by making an unconditional agreement to do God’s will and then being begotten and brought forth as God’s spiritual sons, Christ’s brethren, new creatures. So it is written to these underpriests: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth [water], that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” (Jas. 1:18) For such reason the washed Aaron and his washed sons picture Jesus and his followers as new creatures, the begotten spiritual sons of God.

Evidently by carefully watching the things upon which we fix our affections and longings, or on which we let our minds rest, the things we take into our minds to fill and occupy them, the kind of things we think out. The mind is that faculty of our person by which we gather and store up information so as to reach a conclusion or determination. That with which we occupy our minds and attention will largely decide what we shall be or the course that we shall take and where our affections will incline. Heart defilement comes from the things upon which the mind feeds and by which it lets its decisions be guided. The mind is like a heart which pumps out blood to all the human system.

The authority to be obeyed in this instance is the Supreme Authority, Jehovah God. God-fearing parents who keep in harmony with His Word will teach their children that God’s laws and commandments are one’s supreme obligations and that it is always right to obey these, politics to the contrary. If political governments do not believe we are living in the “time of the end” and in the “consummation of the world” and hence do not provide a true refuge and security against the world disaster, then the parents cannot afford to depend upon the politicians and their religious allies. The God-fearing parents themselves must take steps looking to refuge and security for the children during the universal war of Armageddon; and this they must do in harmony with God’s instructions.

He is in the service of the Owner only for what selfish benefit he can get out of it. He is more interested in the pay or hire that is attached to the work than in the good of the sheep or honor and prosperity of their Owner. Just take away the pay or hire which he feels is his due and he will quit the Owner’s service. Selfishness prevents him from having the “joy of Jehovah”, and he sees no reward or privilege in simply having an unselfish part in vindicating Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and holy name. He is unwilling to expose himself to harm and danger lest Jehovah suffer any loss to his sheep. He does not respect himself so as to show the high qualities of godly courage and reliability.

He is the Mediator of the new and better covenant by sacrifice and is the One that makes it with Jehovah in behalf of the new “holy nation”, the “church of the living God”. When a believer in God and his Christ dedicates himself to God unreservedly to do God’s will, he does not lay down any conditions upon which he thus dedicates himself to God, as, for example, that he be sacrificed with Christ Jesus. Certainly the men of good-will who today are dedicating themselves to God according to His will do not thus do on the condition that they be taken into the church which is the “body of Christ” and be “made conformable unto his death”. Their full dedication of themselves is an unconditional one, and they let God decide as to disposing of them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.—1 John 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a justified believer should lose faith and reject this Son of God and deny the sanctifying power of his blood, then such unfaithful one has no sacrifice left for the canceling of his sins. Nothing but destruction, the punishment of willful rebels against God, awaits him. “Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant [Jesus’ blood which validates God’s new covenant], wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?” The grace and mercy of the great Spirit Jehovah cease toward such willful sinner, and the divine vengeance which is against all those who turn to the Devil will punish him with everlasting destruction. (Heb. 10: 26-30) All the faithful ones sanctified by the blood are saints, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">saint</span><span class="font5"> means </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sanctified one.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those priests whose ordination or installation was being perfected or completed must abide at their posts at the tabernacle and never go outside the court enclosure. Day and night they were to keep at their posts. Even so, Christ Jesus on earth never forsook his post of duty till death; he completed a period of duty corresponding to the seven days of installation. Hence, when raised from the dead, he was perfected as High Priest in heaven for evermore. So, too, with his anointed followers: they must complete a perfect period of installation or consecration symbolized by the seven days. In ministering to others God’s Word, they must be “faithful unto death”. Then they will be perfected in the resurrection. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Clear through the war of 1939-1945 and till now Jehovah’s witnesses have kept up their activity as Kingdom publishers. This is proof that He has liberated the children of “Jerusalem which is above” and has returned with favor to these representatives of Zion. Their deliverance was an open expression of the power of Jehovah’s mighty arm of salvation. By their fearless activity and the news-content of their exclusive message the people of good-will of all nations see Jehovah’s holy arm bared and that it has brought salvation to his faithful people. Such people of good-will, to the ends of the earth where the gospel has been preached thus far, see that now in this atomic age they must trust solely in the saving arm of Jehovah God for everlasting salvation.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God is true.—John 3:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this period of human history Jehovah God stands bound by his own word to prove he is true. He gives the proof by fulfilling the Bible and its prophecies and thus providing the official interpretation of it. Then his holy spirit discloses such interpretation in the fulfilled Bible. By accepting such interpretation the true church safeguards herself against private, individual interpretation. Thus she today, as the Israel of God whom he has gathered into a unity in his Theocratic organization, knows God has proved true to his Word. We therefore publicly declare and confess that Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, is the Supreme Authority, the living Teacher of his church of witnesses, and the Infallible Interpreter of his Word of truth. We concede the truth, and the whole truth, to Him and his Christ. With fullness of conviction we align ourselves with the inspired apostle who said: “Let God prove to be true.”—Rom. 3:4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.—Heb. 11:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful ones of old are not to be perfected apart from the sons of God associated with Christ in the heavenly kingdom. Nineteen centuries ago on the day of Pentecost God began the work of perfecting his faithful sons by justifying them through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus presented in heaven. Now, when resurrecting them from the dead after Christ comes to the temple, God completes their perfecting. There is yet on earth a remnant of these justified sons of God. These await their final perfecting in the resurrection after their obedience has been perfected by suffering as their Captain Christ Jesus suffered on earth. But at present they have the perfect standing with God through justification by Christ’s one sacrifice. This remnant expect to see, shortly, the faithful ones of old brought forth from the graves.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the Lord di-recteth his steps.—Prov. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above verse may be translated also: “A man may plan his course; but the Lord directs his steps.” (An Anter. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Trans.')</span><span class="font5"> What a comfort it is to know and be assured that the Lord God will guide the steps of his faithful ones by His spirit or active force, which spirit is stronger than ourselves and is also unerring! A faithful servant of the Lord God takes his service seriously. He takes his responsibility to heart and tries to make the best plans and arrangements as to his course of serving as a witness for Jehovah. After he has done his part, taking full consideration of God’s written Word, then he looks to God for direction or guidance. If his plans run in as full accord with the Bible as he understands it, then doubtless the Lord God will lead him in the way he planned with divine approval.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weare ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing unto him.—2 Cor. 5:9, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul said he himself was “at home in the body” and hence “absent from the Lord”, not meaning at all that he was in a careless and indifferent spiritual state by any setting of his affections on things here below and looking at transitory things. Inasmuch as flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, therefore the Christians, as long as they live in flesh on the earth, are not residing with Christ Jesus at God’s right hand. They are separated from him; and the limitations of their fleshly eyes make it necessary for them to look to him with the eye of faith. On joining the Lord Jesus in heaven, they will not take their human bodies with them, but they will have to get away from flesh-and-blood bodies by being raised from the dead as spirit creatures, clothed upon with immortality and incorruption. Hence they are determined to seek God’s favor and to please Christ Jesus. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord had respect unto Abel.—Gen. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abel’s sacrifice to the Lord was one'of the firstlings of his flock of sheep. Being offered up slain, it showed he confessed to being a sinner and that he needed a sin-cleansing sacrifice and that he had faith that God would provide such a sacrifice from his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5"> in due time. Abel’s choice victim was an expression of his thankfulness to God for the privilege of living and having hope of a future deliverance from sin and its effects. His sacrifice also showed he did not approve of his parents’ rebellion against God in Eden and that he recognized Jehovah God as the Universal Sovereign and the rightful Lawgiver and Judge. The dead victim on the altar bespoke that Abel sought God and lovingly consecrated himself to God in full faith that he exists and is a righteous Rewarder. Thus Abel provided the first pattern for mankind of true and acceptable worship of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No, I maul and master my body, lest, after preaching to other people, I am disqualified myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 9:27, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After having made a record of missionary and preaching work unsurpassed by any other apostle, then if Paul yielded to the self-indulgence of his body and the pleasing of himself selfishly, it would cause him to be cast away, rejected. He would lose the prize at God’s hands. He did not deceive himself into thinking he could spend an ordinary workingman’s day in preaching publicly and from house to house and thereafter, in the time for recreation or in his very private relations, he could go the way of this world. That way is unrighteous, and Paul reminded himself continually that, morning, noon and night, he must be for righteousness, and this in his relations private and public. While amidst the world, he did not make himself a part of it or let himself drift into its ways. He did So by not making this world his friend. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses will not alter their God-given message out of fear or favor. Amid inescapable prominence because of being so manifestly not of this world and its conspiracy they will not withhold from the people “all the counsel of God”. They will unalterably point the people to the law and the testimony which Jehovah has entrusted- to their care. There is no light of the new day of righteousness in any other message. There is no safety in any other rule of conduct amid this world conspiracy. Christendom has proved herself a friend of this world. In displeasure at her God has withheld from her his prophetic message and his doctrine, and no light shines through Christendom’s organization. He has given his law and his testimony to his faithful witnesses. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the truth of Jehovah endureth for ever. ~Ps. 117:2, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is given as a powerful reason for uniting in praise of the Lord God. Before saying such a thing about Jehovah’s truth, the psalmist had at least one thousand years of time behind him over which to test the truthfulness of God’s spoken and written Word, but, despite that lapse of time, his Word gave proof of being genuine as changeless truth. The facts of history to the psalmist’s day proved Jehovah lived up to his word, fulfilling it and thereby establishing it as truth for all future generations to consult. Its truthfulness proved God’s faithfulness. It made certain he would fulfill his covenant with Abraham to bless all nations of the earth. It gave the unshakable conviction that his covenant with David for the Kingdom would not fail but in due time its Messianic Heir would appear and in due time the Kingdom would be established in his mighty hand.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s covenant for the everlasting kingdom will no more fail than will the sun and moon. (89: 34-37) Hence those who suffer reproach because they follow the footsteps of God’s Anointed, Jesus Christ, will enjoy God’s loving-kindness and will see the iron rod of his King used upon all enemies of the Messiah: “Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness? Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples, wherewith thine enemies have reproached ... the footsteps of thine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">anointed</span><span class="font5"> [Messiah].” (89:49-51, A.S.P.) Inescapably all the nations that are the enemies of Jehovah’s Anointed King who was foreshadowed by David are due for a severe treatment at God’s hands, according to the words of the prophetic psalm.

<p><span class="font5">Only the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sheep</span><span class="font5"> benefit by his death as a ransom sacrifice. It is only for such that he laid down his life. The sheep of the “little flock” inside the special fold of the Abrahamic covenant arrangement are first to benefit by his death. It is because the merit of his redemptive sacrifice is applied first to them due to their faith during this period since his death and down to the final end of this wicked world, at Armageddon. By reason of such first benefits they are favored to gain entrance into the Kingdom and to sit with Christ on his heavenly throne and to reign with him a thousand years. But Jesus laid down his life for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> sheeplike ones, including those who gain everlasting life on earth beneath the kingdom of heaven. This is true because the life he sacrificed for others was earthly human life. All who want eternal life must become his sheep. For such he died.

<p><span class="font5">Aaron in his cleansed state pictured the perfect man Jesus at the time that he offered himself in full dedication to God to do what was henceforth the divine will for him. (Heb. 7:26) But as concerns Jesus’ faithful followers who are recruited from among the sinful descendants of Adam, these do need cleansing by the washing in the waters of heavenly truth. As Moses washed Aaron’s sons, so Jesus washes the other members of the royal priesthood, the church. (Eph. 5:25-27) The submitting to being washed symbolizes the person’s obedience to the truth. Hence, in their washed condition, Aaron and his sons picture Jesus and his footstep followers as having obeyed the truth to the point of entering into an agreement with God to do his will and then being born of water (truth) and of the spirit. (John 3: 3, 5) This means they have been begotten of Jehovah God by his spirit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The wicked religionists have judged God to be just like themselves. They have set up their own human standards, and then they have painted God as approving of those standards and as using these religionists to be his preachers and representatives. Now the time of trial and judgment is here. Shall God keep silence any longer? No; and he has not done so. He has raised up his witnesses and by these he has sent his message of judgment. By it he shows up the wicked as hypocrites, and corrects the wrong impression they have made respecting God. By his faithful witnesses he puts the matter forth plainly to the public and in the sight of the wicked. Thus he vindicates his side of the covenant, proving he is not party to the wickedness of men not living up to the covenant. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">If Jehovah had not accepted the Aaronic priesthood as true and qualified, he would never have sent out his miraculous fire from the pillar of cloud above the tabernacle and devoured the remainder of the sacrifices on the altar. That was the first entry by Aaron, accompanied by Moses, into the Most Holy of the tabernacle, before God’s presence represented there. Hence their entry foreshadowed Jesus’ ascension to heaven and appearing in Jehovah’s glorious presence with the merit of his sacrifice. Their coming forth alive and blessing the people pictured the coming of Christ Jesus, who is both the High Priest and the Greater Moses, into his thousand-year kingdom of blessing for humankind.—Heb. 9:27,28.

He has comforted on earth the once waste places of his organization Zion. What was once a wilderness due to wicked enemy action during World War I he has now made to blossom like Eden, and to flourish with his witnesses and their Christian fruits like the garden of Jehovah. The visible part of his organization Zion is the one organization of people that is happy in a true and basic sense.

This does not mean the invisible, heavenly kingdom of God which was established over our earth A.D. 1914, when He installed Christ Jesus on the heavenly throne to rule for Him among His enemies. In harmony with the fulfillment of all the parables concerning the kingdom of heaven it must be referring to the visible organization on earth of God’s people who are in line for the heavenly kingdom with Christ. The parables show how this visible organization is brought together and how it works. The one on earth who was the beginning of this visible organization with Kingdom hopes was Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">“What is truth?” is a question as good to ask now as when Pilate first asked it of Jesus. The truth is the good news that issues forth from the Lord God in spite of enemies who try to distort and garble and to ex-out and kill it. Jesus’ admission to God, “Thy word is truth,” proves that the truth is contained in God’s Holy Scriptures, the Holy Bible. All the truth of the Bible revolves around its greatest doctrine or teaching, namely, that of the kingdom of God by his Son Jesus Christ, since it is by that kingdom that Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and good name will be forever vindicated. Hence the primary purpose for which he sent his Son into the world was to be a publisher of this truth. This fact Pilate drew out of him when he asked Jesus: “Art thou a king then?” “Certainly,” replied Jesus, “I am a king.

<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding being misshapen in iniquity inherited from Adam, David’s heart or his mental affection never veered away from Jehovah as the One to be worshiped. Several times he was overtaken by grievous sins; but he never showed a love for sin. Each time he humbled himself, repented with sincerity of heart and turned to God for mercy, taking God’s chastisements without rebellion or complaining. He delighted in the worship of Jehovah and took all steps possible to exalt and advance God’s worship during his kingship. Therefore God declared David to be a “man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will”. Being for the Lord God wholeheartedly, David died faithful.

<p><span class="font5">Since the old Mosaic covenant had its sacrifice of validation and its mediator, and its priesthood, the making of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font5"> covenant means there must be a new sacrifice, a new mediator, a new priesthood, and not inferior ones, but better ones, because the new covenant is a better covenant based upon better promises. Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, is the one qualified to act as Mediator of the new covenant with its better promises. Seeing that he was the Son of God come down to earth and born as a natural Israelite, he offered a better sacrifice than the Jewish priests did in that he offered up his own human self. He was therefore fit to serve as a High Priest better and more effective than the Aaronic priesthood of the old Mosaic law covenant.

<p><span class="font5">There can be no sanctification of human creatures without the truth, and the truth with such power is in the written Word of God. Jesus prayed to God to do the sanctifying by means of the power of His truth. That means that God would purify their minds and lives from religious errors and practices. He would separate them from the world and would prepare and equip them more and more for his service. All this God would do by the truth. The truth exposes the lies and errors of this world and its religion, and exposes the world as being the Devil’s organization from which we must keep ourselves unspotted if we would worship and serve the true God.

The use of this rod for their good does not spell oppression, but expresses a love combined with wisdom and with strength. Failure to use the rod will result in disrespect and then unruliness. In the benefits resulting later, the child will open its eyes to its parents’ wisdom and lovingness and will respect them for the correction. Moreover, thereby it has the chance to show obedience, and it will learn in a most impressional manner the proper respect for authority that is delegated by God and will thus learn to fear him also.

These oppressed and restrained witnesses of Jehovah were released in 1919 and went forward with the work of bearing witness to God’s name and kingdom. In the light of the truth they have continuously endeavored to wipe out all trace of Babylonish religion from their midst and to adhere strictly to God’s Word of truth; and thus the truth has made them truly free from Babylon and its bondage.

(Luke 24:44-48) Copying Jesus’ method, the apostle Paul likewise referred to the written prophetic testimony about Jesus. (Acts 26:22,23) By thus testifying to Jesus, neither Paul nor John were belittling Jehovah or pushing him into the background.

<p><span class="font5">The Israelites, in slaying the passover lamb, picture how those who become Jehovah’s name-people see and confess their need of the sacrifice of His Lamb to provide them with protection from death under God’s judgment against sin and this world. Sprinkling the lamb’s blood upon the doorway pictures how those who become Christians or spiritual Israelites openly confess their faith in the ransoming power of the Son of God who was slain; and how, through belief, they have their hearts and consciences cleansed from the guilt of sin by the application to them of the merit of his blood. No blood was splashed upon the doorstep or threshold of the house. This was because those who keep faith in the power of Christ’s blood do not trample underfoot the Son of God by denying their redemption through his sacrifice.

<p><span class="font5">We </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5"> study and give attention to God’s words as recorded in the Bible. We must listen to the sayings and preachings that proceed from His mouth and through His Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus. We must treasure up his truth within us and let it be our meditation and guide. The truth of his Word is what we should speak, and not the perverse, rebellious ideas and teachings of this world. Rather than turn and look yearningly at the selfish things which will line our path through this postwar world, we will obey God by looking straight ahead to the new world of life and peace and keeping our eyes fixed upon His kingdom by Christ. So proceeding with firm determination, we will keep our feet from evil and our line of march will be ordered in the right way. The goal which we will finally attain will be life.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believing means making a consecration to God, and not just a mental agreeing with the facts about God and Christ. Consecration to God means setting oneself aside or apart as holy unto God, and such consecration is a solemn agreement to do God’s will. It is an act of faith and must be done through Christ Jesus, by whom comes the forgiveness of sins to make the one consecrating acceptable to God. The consecration is then openly symbolized ,by water baptism; but the consecration is carried out by doing God’s will in righteousness and being a faithful witness, confessing to Him with the mouth and without shame. As Cornelius did while listening to the apostle Peter preach, one may make his consecration privately, in the heart, in prayer to God through Christ.—Acts 10:44-48.

<p><span class="font5">Today Jehovah’s witnesses declare it is now high time for all humankind to recognize Christ Jesus as the rightful Heir and King of the righteous new world. Because they are so few and so lowly in the eyes of all Christendom, the proclamation by Jehovah’s witnesses of the kingdom of Jehovah’s covenant with his anointed King seems like the trickling, soft-going waters of Shiloah. But, all the same, the truths thus proclaimed quench our spiritual thirst. They revive all those who give allegiance to the heavenly Jerusalem, Zion, which is the capital organization of God’s universal sovereignty. But “this people” of Christendom do not come gladly to the spiritual “waters of Shiloah” and drink of such Kingdom truths and rejoice in the fulfilled Kingdom covenant. They do not act in obedience to God’s invitation by His witnesses: “Be glad, ye nations, with his people.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Religious traditions of men are admittedly additions to God’s written Word. The written Word was first, because traditions claim to interpret it and hence must be added. Therefore the written Word is fundamental, basic, and beyond contradiction. By the very first Bible writer, Moses, the divine warning is given against making such traditional additions to God’s written Word, which bars out an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">oral</span><span class="font5"> law. Also by the very last Bible writer, John, the like divine warning is given by the Prophet greater than Moses. (Rev. 22:18) Like Jesus we choose to give the truth to God, in the black and white of His written Bible; Jesus said: “Thy word is truth.” If the religious Hierarchy prefers religious traditions as superior to the Bible, our position is that of Paul, who whote: “Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar.”—Rom. 3:3,4.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake, awake; . . . put on thy beautiful garments, 0 Jerusalem, the holy city!—Isa. 52:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What gave ancient Jerusalem her beauty like a garment was the identifying herself as being entirely devoted to Jehovah and as being the city where He had put his name, locating his temple there. This shows how the remnant of the children of “Jerusalem which is above” became a holy organization from and after 1919 and put on beautiful garments. It was by rousing themselves from their inert, disorganized state and seeking to be exclusively an organization of Jehovah’s servants who are unreservedly dedicated to him and who refuse to render slavish service to the Babylonish worldly organization. They must seek to be actively a “people for his name”, Jehovah’s name, and to identify themselves as witnesses of Him and ambassadors for his now-set-up kingdom under Christ. Thus Jerusalem’s remnant of children put on her beautiful garments of identification. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Therefore Jehovah God has enthroned his Shepherd Christ Jesus, the King greater than shepherd David. To correspond with the ancient international conspiracy against David’s reign on Mount Zion, today all nations of this world are gathering together into a world plot against Jehovah’s Anointed King reigning in the heavenly Zion. But such raging of the nations is in vain, and the peoples imagine a vain thing, as their earthly kings set themselves and their rulers take counsel together against Jehovah and his Anointed King. His King is enthroned on the heavenly Zion to stay. Jehovah, by his witnesses, has spoken for many years to the nations in his wrath. Soon now He will vex them in his sore displeasure by the final universal war of Armageddon. He will signal to the King, and Christ Jesus will shepherd the opposing nations with his rod of iron and destroy them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the hearts of the “other sheep” God has kindled the hope of meeting his Judge’s approval and serving Jehovah God without a break in life and without a dissolving of the body clear through the end of this world at Armageddon and on into the new world. Some of these “other sheep” may die in faithfulness before the final war of Armageddon clears away the wicked world that now dominates this earth, but they hope in the resurrection. When revived to life on this earth in the new world, they will come forth from the grave in fleshly bodies such as it pleases God to give, but not to groan in them or to be oppressed. By continued obedience to Jehovah’s Judge and King they hope to have His healing and cleansing blessings upon their bodies and in time to attain to perfection under Christ’s thousand-year reign over earth.

<p><span class="font5">God blessed this seventh day in that he purposed it to be a good day, that should bring blessing to His holy name. His very desisting from further work as to the earth marked the seventh day as different; but he sanctified it in that he set it apart for vindicating his name and vindicating his universal sovereignty and supremacy. Lucifer, Adam and Eve became sabbathbreakers. God let them live, but promised that on his rest-day he would bring a holy Seed forth from his heavenly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5"> his organization, who would vindicate his Father Jehovah against that old Serpent Satan. In this atomic age all the nations, under demonic guidance, are pushing ahead to the battlefield of Armageddon, where Jehovah will sanctify himself upon them by destroying all who reproach his name and oppose his kingdom. That victory will sanctify or set him apart as holy and Sovereign over all. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.—John 10:10, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus undertook to prove himself a “good shepherd”. He himself set forth the standard by which such a one is to be measured, namely, that he fearlessly and self-sacrificingly lay down his own life that the sheep might gain life and further enjoy Jehovah’s goodness. To have life abundantly means to have it to the full, eternally, without end inside of Jehovah’s universal organization. Only everlasting life in the enjoyment of God’s service and goodness gives satisfaction to the creature who loves God. Earthly human shepherds can only watch out for the life of sheep in this world, and which life is limited; the heavenly Good Shepherd watches for and safeguards the eternal life of the sheep in the New World. His sacrificed life provides the means whereby the sheep are redeemed from destruction and gain endless life. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There, eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded.—Lev. 8:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s command to eat part of the consecration ram boiled, together with most of the foodstuffs in the basket of installation, points to the comforting fact that he would provide for the nourishment and sustenance of his “royal priesthood” while engaged in his service. Primarily, the nourishment would be of a spiritual kind, to keep them strong and healthy as new creatures begotten of God by his own spirit. However, while they were serving God in their fleshly bodies their earthly provision would also not fail, but would always be ample, with possibly some to spare. “Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” (1 Cor. 9:13,14) Jesus said workmen deserve food.

<p><span class="font5">Messiah’s being cut off was not on his own account or due to any sin of his own. Neither did he have any part in this world. His kingdom is not of this world, and the “prince of this world” found in Jesus nothing in common with the Devil and his world. “He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation?” (Isa. 53: 8) This shows there is just the one Messiah and that he needs no generation of successors, because Almighty God raised him up to life immortal in the heavens. Thereby he has the power of an endless life to carry out the work of everlasting blessing to all the families and nations of the earth. This, therefore, rules out the need of any successor in the form of a so-called “vicar” or “vicegerent” at Rome or at Vatican City.

<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom established in 1914 is now destined to come against all enemies to wipe them completely out from the universe. Therefore the law that went forth from Jehovah God was this instruction to his Son: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” That Son must rule amid all the enemies till he has vindicated Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and name. That is the highest justice; it is the righteousness that must be established for ever, namely, the vindication of His rightful sovereignty and stainless name. The truth about his vindication by his kingdom under Christ is the light that must go forth to all the people of goodwill. Hence Jesus’ prophecy, for our working instructions today, says: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As to calling the heavens above to attend the trial the prophet Isaiah had a vision of Jehovah’s judicial representative seated on the throne at the temple and indicates that the seraphim are present at the trial and testifying to God’s holiness and righteousness. (Isa. 6:1-7) Christ the King is Jehovah’s judicial appointee to the bench of judgment at the temple; and when he comes in his glory and sits upon the throne of his glory, “all the holy angels” are with him. (Matt. 25:31,32) Thus Christ’s attendant angels of heaven are also present at the trial. Besides that, the “earth”, that is to say, all the nations of earth, are gathered to the trial. They cannot escape being assembled for the grand inquiry and investigation, because Almighty God has called and those due for questioning are located among all nations.

<p><span class="font5">According to Jesus’ parable the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good seed</span><span class="font5"> are wheat seed. In Palestine in his day the wheat harvest began the next day after the feast of Pentecost. On the day of Pentecost the holy spirit of God was poured down upon his first disciples, all “children of the kingdom”. Right then a great campaign of witnessing to the fact that Jesus was exalted and was made Lord and Christ began. (Acts 2:1-41) Significantly, when the great witness to God’s established kingdom began A.D. 1919, during this harvest of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good seed</span><span class="font5"> or wheat class, there was a notable outpouring of God’s spirit upon Jehovah’s witnesses in final fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2: 28, 29. The remnant of the wheat class received this outpouring of the spirit to arouse and fit them for the harvesttime work of preaching the glad news of the Kingdom to all men.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 52:11, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inspired apostle Paul applies these words to Christians, who have left the great antitypical Babylon, this world of uncleanness and false worship. The words apply particularly from and after A.D. 1918. That year Jehovah’s great Messenger Christ Jesus came to the temple and thereafter began delivering God’s worshipers from bondage and subjection to heathenish, antitypical Babylon. In order to reconstruct pure worship upon earth he entrusted to his remnant of worshipers sacred vessels, and in the handling of these they must be clean in God’s sight. To be thus clean they must touch no unclean Babylonish thing with desire for it or for pleasure in it. Doing so results in becoming spotted with this world.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.—Luke 24:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this continual referring to the written Hebrew Scriptures was no attempt on Jesus’ part to set the authority of the Bible above that of Jehovah God. To the contrary, it was a faithful proving of God’s authority by a careful reference to his written Word of prophecy and instruction. Jesus was giving the truth to God’s Word. He ordered his course of life in order that God’s word might prove true and thereby be vindicated. He did not take </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">part</span><span class="font5"> of God’s Scriptures and set the rest aside, but quoted and applied to himself the scriptures from all parts of the Hebrew scriptures as contained under the headings, “the law” and “the prophets” and “the psalms”. Thus he did not act inconsistently, but showed that God’s Word agreed with itself. In so doing, Jesus set us a pattern. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus being High Priest according to the rank of Melchizedek, who was both king and priest, Jesus and his followers or underpriests make up a royal priesthood. Nevertheless their royalty does not lift from them the obligation and appointment to now preach God’s name and kingdom. The apostle puts emphasis on this obligation, saying to them: “Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. ... ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; [why?] that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Pet. 2:5, 9) This is a righteous service, this showing forth of God’s praises and offering spiritual sacrifices, namely, “sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks.”—Heb. 13:15.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Above all that must be guarded keep thou thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.—Prov. 4:23, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Human experience shows diseases of the heart are usually traceable to something primarily wrong in other organs and that if the heart is impaired or badly affected it cannot do its work right. If this state is not corrected but is let continue, death will follow to the human creature. The Christian cannot afford to let such a thing take place in a spiritual way; not if his ambition is to vindicate God’s name and gain eternal life in the righteous new world. Carelessness as to his heart means death as a Christian now and death to all hope of life in the world to come. In other words, it means for such careless Christian “the second death” because of the “sin unto death”, deadly sin. (1 John 5:16) How, then, can we keep and guard our hearts in a spiritual sense?

<p><span class="font5">Jesus compares himself to a sheep, under his Father Jehovah’s care. He is God’s beloved Lamb. On sighting Jesus some forty days after his baptism and anointing John the Baptizer cried out: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29) Throughout the last book of the Bible Christ Jesus is twenty-eight times spoken of as “the Lamb”, that is, Jehovah’s Lamb. For example, we read regarding the New Jerusalem: “I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.” (Rev. 21:22) Thus they are shown to be two Persons, different from each other, and the Lamb is shown to be not the Lord God Almighty. The Lord God Almighty is Jehovah; the Lamb is his Son Jesus, who is indeed mighty, but not almighty. Jehovah’s being the great “Shepherd and Overseer” and Jesus’ being “the Good Shepherd” make both of them one in purpose. “I and my Father are one,” said Jesus.

They must break away from captivity and return to organized activity as Jehovah’s Theocratic organization which knows no bondage to Babylon. They must be strong in Him their God. The ensnaring fear of men, and the weakening doctrines and traditions of religion about “the higher powers”, must all be purged out by re-examining the Bible and learning the “present truth”, which brings freedom. By feeding upon God’s Word of truth, Zion’s remnant put on strength to do their commissioned work; they grew strong. “Through knowledge shall the just be delivered.” “A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.”—Prov. 11:9; 24:5. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Understanding that he is the Mediator of the new covenant because he is at the same time the sacrificial victim over whose blood the new covenant comes into force, Jesus celebrated the last passover with his disciples A.D. 33 and then set up a Memorial of Christ’s death. Those brought into the new covenant as members of the new nation must drink his blood, figuratively speaking. That is, his shed blood represents death sacrificially in vindication of Jehovah’s name; and so these in the new covenant must die with him and be “made conformable unto his death” and be “baptized into his death”. At his death on that passover day the new covenant was made valid. But it was not inaugurated till he ascended to heaven after his resurrection. As its mediator he inaugurated it at Pentecost by pouring out the holy spirit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

No creatures will ever be able to hiss and wag the head in contempt at that heavenly Jerusalem and to say with reproach to God: “Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?” (Lam. 2:15) On the contrary, the present governments, which now trample under foot the Christian ambassadors of Jehovah’s New World government and which refuse to yield up their power to it, will be destroyed at the coming battle of Armageddon.

This is desirable now. (Luke 12:51-53; Mark 13:10-13) Parents should take positive action for the sake of those whom God puts under their spiritual care to counteract things tending to family treachery and division. The best way, as advised by God’s Word, is to give the minor children the nurture and admonition of the Lord, not only in a theoretical way with verbal teaching but in a practical way with actual demonstration given in God’s service. Associate your offspring with you in God’s active service as His witnesses. Forge those bonds between yourselves and your children in the Lord to unbreakable strength, by sharing your Christian experience with them.

Those who have tasted his deliverance are the only happy and blessed people on this earth. They are the only free people, breathing a freedom which even the peoples of the modern democracies and republics do not enjoy. Such peoples under forms of political democracy are not free from man’s great enemy, and their present-day difficulties prove it. Centuries before Christ Jehovah God brought about a deliverance foretold at Jeremiah, chapter 31. But that deliverance was only partial and temporary. It was only a type of the greater and true deliverance which was yet to come. It guaranteed that Jeremiah’s prophecy would be fulfilled in a large and complete way in God’s due time.

No; but in each case they bear witness of Jehovah God as the Resurrector, as the Almighty One who raised this dead Son to life. Thus they give the supreme glory to God and vindicate his word and power. The big fact is that God did the raising of Jesus to life and the making of him a princely Leader, Savior and Judge of the living and dead. By such testimony the apostles did not waver from being witnesses of Jehovah, while at the same time they were witnesses to Jesus. God held himself to his own stated rule regarding witnesses. So he produced the required two or three witnesses on earth, and many more, verily more than five hundred at one time. (1 Cor. 15:6) God has the whole truth on his side, to His glory.

The purpose behind this onrush of enemy waters will be to sweep away or overwhelm everyone that does not conform himself to the world’s political and religious ideas. It will be just before the universal battle of Armageddon is due to break out. Although the flood appears up to the neck and about ready to submerge the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses upon earth, they must not yield to fear. They will have confidence in Isaiah’s words above uttered long ago in the face of like danger. They will trust in the covert of Jehovah’s wings.—Ps. 61:4.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has pierced the claim of the dragon organization of the Devil that it is the “higher powers” to which all Christians must be subject. He has fatally wounded it by the truth now declared by Jehovah’s remnant that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus alone are the “higher powers” whom we must obey. (Rom. 13:1) The surging masses of mankind, alienated from God, looked then like the Red sea, threatening to block the path of his witnesses in their march to freedom in His Theocratic organization. But, commanding his witnesses that they go forward right on into the midst of all peoples and nations, Jehovah God has cleared the way for them to pass through, leaving behind them on all sides their testimony to His name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 12:14, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This troubled world is not at peace with God, but is at deadly enmity with him and is preparing for the showdown fight against him at Armageddon. To make our peace with it would mean becoming the enemy of God and his King Christ Jesus. On the other hand, if we would see God’s everlasting glory in the new world without end, we must seek and keep our peace with him by setting ourselves apart from this world and being completely for Jehovah’s universal sovereignty by his kingdom. We must suffer the persecution from the world, which he permits to come upon us as chas-tenings to separate us from this world unto true holiness. We must seek peace with those devoted to him and with all “men of good will”. Hence let the work of sanctification go on among his people, with pure hearts, free from every root of bitterness.

They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; they are a perverse and crooked generation.—Deut. 32:4,5, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mankind’s present condition is in no way due to the start which God gave to man. He did not create man a beast, below human intelligence, and having a savage heart inclined to cruelty and disposed to fight with others in a selfish contest for survival. Sin, wrongdoing and selfishness of heart men did not get from God the Creator nor inherit such from Him as children of God. It is all due to man’s corrupting of himself in disobedience to God’s perfect law. It is not because the first man and woman were at the start an imperfect work of the Creator. We should not reproach God with any such responsibility, but should vindicate his name of all unjust charges. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the period of sleeping and waiting for the Kingdom’s establishment the dead Christians were as “naked”, that is, unclothed, living neither a life in the flesh nor a life in the spirit. Paul was not eager to die in order to be able to lay down the responsibilities and hardships of his service as a minister of God’s new covenant. He knew that for him to die meant being naked in death, asleep in the grave and awaiting the resurrection. True, he groaned in the flesh, but he did not want to quit God’s earthly service as quickly as possible and cease from the privilege of suffering for the vindication of God’s name and universal sovereignty. What he earnestly wanted was Christ’s return at the establishment of God’s kingdom in order that he might be clothed upon with heavenly life.—Phil. 1:20-24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When a person solemnly agrees with God to do His will and is taken into His organization, he should then have repented of his aforetime impurity and also of sexual vice and sensual practices, if he indulged in such. However, these things try to cling to the repentant one after becoming a follower of Christ. A person’s repentance should, nevertheless, be proved by his forever turning away from such, and not trying to contaminate the Christian congregation with such. A Christian company is not the place for a repentant sinner to drag in worldly impurity, sexual vice and sensual practices. It is not the place to take up and introduce any practice of such. It does not matter that it is committed within the congregation; it is a spot from the world. It defiles true worship. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and Moses burnt the whole ram.—Lev. 8:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This ram for the burnt offering pictured the human sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In all his parts he was a clean sacrifice, as pictured by Moses’ washing all pieces of the ram which had been cut up. And just as water is used as a symbol of divine truth, Jesus laid down his life in sacrifice in the service of truth and he was clean because he was always in harmony with the pure truth. He offered his sacrifice in its entirety to God, as pictured by Moses’ burning all parts of the ram upon the altar. It was complete and was all consumed upon God’s sacrificial arrangement. This was what made it pleasing and acceptable to his heavenly Father, just as the burnt offering testified that the sin offering preceding it was acceptable to the Lord God. Hence the underpriests believe that Jesus’ sacrifice avails for them with God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

(Gal. 5:6) Hence we who live in these last times are given this advice: “But ye, .beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith [by knowledge], praying in the holy spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.” (Jude 20, 21, A.iS.F.) Today, if those who have taken Jehovah’s name should quail in fear at the things coming upon the earth, who else could be strong?

Therefore Peter told the inquirers the particular steps to take now back to a right relationship with God. Repenting and being baptized in Jesus’ name meant, in effect, consecrating to God, for it meant renouncing the way of the world which had killed the Son of God. It meant acknowledging him as Lord and Christ, the High Priest after the royal order of Melchizedek and who sits at God’s right hand in heaven. It meant calling upon the name of Jehovah God for salvation, and doing so through Jesus Christ as the One through whom their sins are forgiven. Being baptized in Jesus’ name meant being immersed unto him as the heavenly Leader in whose footsteps they must follow. The baptism in water was a symbol of their consecration to God in this new relationship.—Acts 2: 21, 33-36. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

All are bidden to do so upon a basis which can hold them all, the Abrahamic covenant for blessing all nations in Abraham’s seed, Messiah. In return for such blessing all nations could be expected to bless and praise the great God who made this unselfish covenant. Hence, loaded with the glad tidings, we can go to any and all nations and report these things and then encourage them, saying: “Praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” That means accepting His provision and then gratefully praising him.

(Isa. 11:5) The blue robe, with its fringe of tinkling bells and woven pomegranates alternately placed, pictured his trueness and faithfulness toward God. (Num. 15:37-41) Its fringe calls attention to fruitfulness in bringing forth the fruits of God’s kingdom and his making a joyful sound through preaching the Kingdom gospel and succeeding in his heavenly Father’s work. The gorgeous apron, or ephod, with its front and back parts which were hung from his shoulders, pictured the two great covenants concerning the Kingdom which depended upon him.

<p><span class="font5">It is perfectly plain why the One who was to become permanent heir to God’s covenant with David for the Kingdom should be called “the Son of David”. Though king of Israel, David personally could not fulfill the covenant because he was mortal and died. For like reason neither could any of his successors to the throne fulfill the covenant, as they were under the condemnation of death inherited from Adam the sinner. The One who could and would be the Heir of that kingdom as “the Son of David” is the One who has immortality, the power of an endless life. Since Jesus was nailed to the tree and died thereon, it must be that he received the power of an endless life or immortality when God raised him from the dead, not leaving his soul or life to the lasting possession of hell or the grave. Thus Jehovah God saved him.—Rev. 1:18. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

Out of this Zion Jehovah has shined forth upon his faithful remnant of anointed witnesses by illuminating the pages of the Bible for them and revealing to them the glorious message of the establishment of the Kingdom in 1914 by the conferring of authority upon Christ Jesus as King.

Hence partaking of the Memorial bread pictures their taking part with Christ Jesus in his reproaches and afflictions as members of his “body”, faithfully to the death. The Memorial wine is handled differently from the passover lamb’s blood, because the wine is not sprinkled but drunk. True, it pictures Christ’s blood; but shed blood represents death, and he suffered not only for mankind’s sins but primarily to vindicate Jehovah’s name. Hence the drinking of the Memorial wine by those who are Christ’s body members pictures their communion in or participating with him in his manner of death for the vindication of God’s name.

It was therefore a good reminder of the distress, hardship, persecution and pressure under which one breaks off from connections with and servitude to this world. Moreover, in thus breaking off, it is no time or occasion for us to think of making ourselves comfortable or pampering the selfish cravings of our flesh.

So, if perfection in the flesh was to come, there must be a new priesthood and a new sacrifice. God provided both. As Jesus could not become priest by descending from the Levite Aaron, Jehovah made him a priest not after Aaron’s line but a priest like Melchizedek, who was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God in Abraham’s day. The apostle Paul shows why Jesus as priest can bring about the completed or perfected salvation of one who holds fast to his faith in Christ, saying : “But he continues forever, and so his priesthood is untransferable. Therefore, he is able to save forever all who come to God through him, because he lives and intercedes for them forever.

That way it might be like a glorious, free and independent city set upon Zion’s hill and which could not be hid from the eyes of all the world. The world, before its final end at Armageddon, must know that Jehovah God has a visible organization and that it stands free and fearless as a witness for Him in the earth.

They are his earthly sheep, whereas those of the special fold of Christ’s joint-heirs are his spiritual sheep. Although he has gone to heaven and has been physically invisible to his sheep on earth, yet he has continued to gather the flock of his Fathers sheep and to care for them. The sheep have continued to hear his voice through the Kingdom message which he committed to his disciples.

Then, having heard with the best of hearing, they obediently apply their right hand or best powers to carrying out these duties and they walk in the way of Jehovah’s service, in the footsteps of their High Priest whose blood redeemed them.

Nor do Jehovah’s witnesses of today agree with the course of King Ahaz or any course like it now.

Since we are to look to him as the leader and perfect example in our course of faith, then what did Jesus as a man do while always showing such respect for God’s authority, even to the limit ? He continually referred to the Bible. In so doing was he belittling God’s authority and setting the authority of the Bible above God’s? No; he was doing the exact opposite.

<p><span class="font5">Of the consecration of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob there can be no doubt. Their faith was a steppingstone into that sacred relationship with God. God made a covenant or solemn agreement with Abraham and with Abraham’s specially chosen descendants through Isaac and Jacob. Hence Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and Jacob’s descendants, the Israelites, were in covenant relationship with God. Jehovah God appointed these three consecrated men to be his commissioned servants and his mouthpieces or witnesses during their travels, as is definitely stated in these words: “When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; he suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed [ones], and do my prophets no harm.” (Ps. 105:9-15) Abraham’s faithfulness to his consecration had the highest witness given to it, namely, by Almighty God himself, at Genesis 26: 5.

<p><span class="font5">By the law of his covenant Jehovah specially named who should be his accepted priests henceforth among the Israelites. God had already sanctified the entire nation to him by delivering them from Egypt; also the whole nation was consecrated to him by their express agreement, to observe his law and keep his covenant; also the firstborn of Israel were also especially sanctified to him. But now, under the law covenant, Jehovah purposed to set aside an exclusive family of Israel to serve as his priests of sacrifice, namely, Aaron and his sons and their male descendants. They were hallowed or sanctified with fitting sacrifices in a symbolic series of acts. (Ex. 29:1-35) This typical procedure pictured the true sanctification of God’s everlasting High Priest, Christ Jesus, and also his underpriests, namely, those who follow his footsteps and whom God anoints to be his body members.

<p><span class="font5">His witnesses have been fearlessly making a united, organized proclamation of God’s name and kingdom in all parts of the earth since World War I closed in 1918. Such united action stands as visible evidence that Almighty God has ransomed and regathered his faithful remnant and that they are singing the praise of Him and his kingdom at his temple “in the height of Zion”. He has filled them with rejoicing and with spiritual abundance, so that, since their restoration, they have borne the “fruits of the Kingdom” to all nations. They are satisfied with God’s goodness through his King Christ Jesus. Their widespread witness activities are carried on for the purpose of ushering persons of all nations now into the gladness of His people, so as to rejoice with them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The inward man is renewed day by day.—2 Cor. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An active Christian need not grow faint and lose heart if he finds God’s service is quite wearing on the flesh and if his body is wasting away and his physical vigor is weakening. As he works on, his outward man may waste away and perish. What he outwardly appears to be as a flesh-and-blood creature may grow old and battered through much affliction at the hands of enemies of the Kingdom gospel. But, the more he carries on in service as God’s witness, the stronger he grows inwardly day by day, both in faith and hope and in spiritual strength and devotion. He is thus renewed each day. This inward renewal gives him more than mere physical strength to keep persistently active in God’s service against all opposition and dangers. What he is inwardly, or this inward self, upholds him. It expresses itself through his visible outward fleshly organism and holds his mind and body steadfast in the Christian ministry.

<p><span class="font5">Burning the sin-bearing bullock’s fat, liver and kidneys on the altar foretold that Christ Jesus the High Priest must consume himself in God’s service. He must serve God with the heat of zeal, with strength and richness of devotion, and with the innermost thoughts of his mind. No dart of sin must ever pierce his liver, but examination of it must show a clean, healthy condition within him. If God examined his reins or kidneys^ he must find Jesus’ most inward thoughts true and faithful to Him and his kingdom. Burning the bullock’s hide, flesh and dung typified that Jesus in the flesh was ordained to suffer fiery trials, being reproached as if outside the camp of God’s organization, and at last being killed by religionists as a blasphemer and evil-doer. This fiery experience was to prove his integrity and thus qualify him perfectly for his everlasting priesthood. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The superhuman government or “kingdom of heaven” which Jehovah God sets up for his new world was long ago pictured. It was foreshadowed by the city of Jerusalem, or Zion. Because Jehovah brushes the present devilish heavens out from control over mankind and creates a new heavenly government, perfect in beauty of righteousness, men who gain eternal life on earth will seek their blessings in the name of Jehovah, and will pay their vows in his name. (Isa. 65:16-18) Due to its perfection, Jehovah’s new world will be a continual delight to man. It will leave nothing to be desired. There will be no looking back and no longing for the old, long-established things of the present due to any comparison of old and new showing up in favor of this present world of Devil-rule.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.—John 10:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calling the sheep by name denotes the shepherd’s great familiarity and intimacy with the sheep and his knowledge of them and care for them individually. They are not just a nameless mass of sheep-flesh to him. The first ones that Jesus called were Andrew, John, Simon, Philip, and Nathanael. (John 1:35-51) ‘Leading them out’ does not mean bringing them out from under the curse of the law covenant, never to return, but it refers to leading them forth to pastures where they could feed upon Kingdom truths. As he said to them: “It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 13:11) And just as a shepherd leads his flock back to the fold after they have pastured through the daylight hours, so Jesus always kept his sheep in touch with the fold of the Abrahamic covenant arrangement, which fold Jehovah God faithfully safeguarded. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the world now about to pass away there are no true, heart-satisfying joy and happiness, because its pleasures are selfish, misleading, and like feeding on ashes that leave a bitter taste. Nowhere on earth are grander joys and blessings to be found than within the safe and secure walls of God’s organization. They are a foretaste of the everlasting blessings and joys that will be the lot of the faithful worshipers in the righteous world to come. So, let no one disturb his own joy and blessing by dealing wrongfully toward his brethren by seeking any selfish advantage. Let all respect each one’s rights and obligations, even those of the fatherless and widows. Let all live purely toward one another. All the faithful ones will unitedly help the entire company of God’s consecrated people to maintain pure and undefiled worship of Him, without spot from this world.

<p><span class="font5">All on earth are summoned, from the far east to the far west, “from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof,” or wherever the sun shines. In view of the general ignorance in which religion has left the mass of mankind, Jehovah’s calling the earth over so wide an extent indicates that he obligates himself to do something. What? To get his message, by which he summons the court attenders, out to all nations, kindreds, peoples and languages. Since he sends his message by means of human servants on earth, as servers of the notice, this also indicates a tremendous work of publicity by his witnesses to get His message out. Even with their unparalleled publication till now in eightyeight different languages by such few witnesses of Jehovah as there are since A.D. 1918, the end of calling the earth from east to west is not yet.

But its mind is very tender and easily subject to impressions. Hence the child in its tender years is very impressionable, and what makes an impression upon its mind cuts deep and almost beyond erasure. Then is the time of greatest opportunity for those who brought it into the world to put in its mind thoughts of God, and by daily and repeated remindings of Godly things to build up in it a mind filled with God and that inclines toward him and fears him. The child must become immovable in this mental and heart attitude, so that later it will not be swayed to and fro by surroundings and by opposing impressions.—Eph. 4:13,14.

<p><span class="font5">All who worthily bear the name of “Christian” must now be witnesses of Jehovah, the same as is Jesus Christ, who calls himself “the Amen, the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 3:14) In their witness work they may be certain of having the co-operation of the mighty angels of God who accompany Jesus Christ at the temple of God. Such angels have an unseen part in the “testimony of Jesus”, but their co-operation is assured to us according to what the angel told John who fell at his feet to worship him. Because of having the “testimony of Jesus”, that angel and his fellow angels must co-operate unseen with the remnant of God’s woman’s seed who keep God’s commandments by holding forth the testimony or witness of Jesus Christ.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His merciful kindness is great toward us.—Ps. 117:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s loving-kindness is his mercy, that is to say, his goodness expressed, being prompted by love and not by cold justice. Hence his mercy or merciful kindness is unselfish and seeks the eternal welfare of those to whom it is expressed. This mercy of God reached its highest expression in providing the Messiah. The setting up of Messiah’s kingdom and its operation for a thousand years after Armageddon is for the purpose of completely bringing about the full deliverance of all the believing, obedient ones of mankind from the tyranny of sin, death and the Devil’s organization. Jehovah’s kingdom by his Messiah will utterly wipe out that wicked organization in the battle of Armageddon. Hence the arranging for the Kingdom and providing it and setting it up in the heavens A.D. 1914 was the very peak of Jehovah’s mercy to humanity.

They prove to be sheeplike ones who do good to even the very least of these brethren of the King Christ Jesus. At the sound of the message of his voice they follow him as Jehovah’s Good Shepherd, and thus demonstrate that they are his “other sheep”. Just because they are not of the Kingdom “wheat” class, it does not mean they are of the tare class. They have no part or sympathy with the tares who neglect to do good to the King’s least brethren but who rather do positive injury to them, if possible. Hence, as the facts show today, these “other sheep” are being separated from the tare class of religious Christendom. The “tares” are proving to be “goats” as in contradistinction to the “other sheep” class. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

This typical sacrifice gives certain promise that the believers of mankind, typified by the non-priestly tribes of Israel, will continually offer to God their thanksgiving for opening up the way to peaceful relations with him by Jesus, his Sin-offering. They cannot enrich him any, but all will be anxious to recompense him by manifesting their gratitude through Christ, giving themselves in full dedication to God through him. And the High Priest Christ Jesus will present their thankful dedication before the Supreme God. Already, the thousands of “men of good will” who are hearing the message of his kingdom by Christ are expressing their thanksgiving to God.

Hence it is rightly said that God sanctified his Son for this holy service. Christ Jesus was at one or in unity with his Father in this service, and he never broke off such union with him by any rebelliousness even under persecution, reproach and dying on the tree. By speaking of himself as “him whom the Father hath sanctified” Jesus showed that sanctification begins with Jehovah God the Father, who set his only begotten Son apart for the special mission to this earth and who therefore equipped his Son with the word of truth to impart it to men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

She should be different by being outstanding for purity of dealing between her members. In the Bible she is likened to a virgin that is betrothed to her Lord and Head, Christ Jesus.

The church cannot afford to let herself be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">defiled </span><span class="font5">from within herself by consenting to any worldly uncleanness practiced internally between any who are members of her. Hence the faithful members, and, above all, those who are appointed as overseers and special servants, should have the same jealous concern over her purity as the apostle Paul had and exemplified to keep her fit for her Bridegroom.

But now look at the state of His devoted ones. Has he comforted his Theocratic organization Zion by what he has done to her children and representatives? Today, in this year 1947, as in contrast with the few thousands back in 1918, those seeking Jehovah and his righteousness have multiplied many times over. Immediately after the end of global war in August, 1945, official reports succeeded in reaching the Watch Tower offices, showing that more than 127,000 had gotten out witnessing in the field regularly each month of the past service year.

<p><span class="font5">From and after 1918 the remnant of Jehovah’s consecrated people received his newly revealed truths and were freed from the bondage of fear and subjection to antitypical Babylon. They sought to be clean like a virgin from all religion and worldliness. Others who consecrated to God since 1918 have been made members of His remnant, with no discrimination against them. In this way all made up one indivisible Theocratic organization dedicated to unitedly worshiping one Almighty God, Jehovah. They worship him at his capital organization under Christ, which organization is called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Zion.</span><span class="font5"> (Jer. 31: 6) Thus the virgin organization of Jehovah’s remnant today is filled with joy and moves harmoniously in his happy service.

<p><span class="font5">Only a wise and knowing heart stands at attention at our right hand like a servant to favor us and thus to help us to make a success at gaining the prize of everlasting life. That is to say: “The wise man’s mind makes for his success; the fool’s mind makes for his failure. Also when a fool goes on his way, his mind [heart] is lacking, and he shows everybody that he is a fool.” (10:2,3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer.

It is because she has rejected God’s Word and it finds no place in her heart and thoughts. The genuine Christian avoids getting into the mental condition of Christendom.

This they do by not conforming to this world or becoming a part of its organization or making any compromise whatever with it. They conform themselves to Christ’s example in worshiping his heavenly Father and preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Christ’s first coming was in order to be a witness to Jehovah to preach God’s kingdom to mankind. His second coming is to enter in upon his kingdom. His entering into his kingdom means the end of this world, for it interrupts Satan’s rule of this world.

So it becomes of present importance for us to consider Noah and his family, the first flood survivors. Let all those who care to survive at this end of the world note that Noah followed Enoch’s course of selfdedication to God. Whereas the wicked generation of the day was doomed to destruction in the deluge, “Noah walked with God.” He carried out his sacred obligations by being a witness for Jehovah God.

If he could see how the prophecy has come true in completion since 1919 upon Jehovah’s witnesses now, it would be most pleasant to him, because it vindicates God’s Word as true. In these days Jehovah has blessed the habitation of his righteous kingdom by Christ and has restored the pure worship at the holy mountain of his spiritual temple. He not only has regathered his remnant of witnesses to a fearless, united worship and service of Him throughout all the earth but has blessed their work in the witness field and among the flocks of God. He has increased their means and methods for holding forth the Kingdom fruit to the peoples of all nations. He has also added to the small number of his remnant a vast number of consecrated persons of goodwill, who increase daily in numbers.

Also it applies to each sanctified follower of Christ Jesus as long as he remains on earth in his imperfect flesh and needs the covering of the merit of Jesus’ sacrifice. The fact that His sacrifice is perfect, complete, and all-sufiicient for removing sins is proved, because it does not need to be renewed or repeated. Whenever the sanctified ones sin because of the inherited imperfections of their flesh, they can go to God and confess and procure forgiveness and cleansing by means of the one and original sacrifice of Christ Jesus. “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son clcanseth us from all sin.

<p><span class="font5">From what the apostle Paul says in connection with the celebration of the feast at 1 Corinthians, chapter 5, how is the feast of unleavened bread fulfilled antitypieally by Christ’s followers? It is fulfilled by the way they live their lives after accepting him as their passover Lamb and thereby gaining deliverance from this world and its sin and condemned state. In the ancient feast the first day and the seventh day were observed by a holy convocation and laying off from works for personal gain. And for any Christian congregation and the men of good-will among them now to observe the antitypieal feast, they must cleanse from their midst anyone active among them like a lump of leaven.

The truth of his published Word triumphs over all the error that circulates throughout this earth. What is more welcome than a bearer of good news ? “Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.” “A faithful ambassador is health.” (Prov. 16:24; 13:17) Such is Jehovah’s Chief Messenger, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I, Jehovah, will be their God.—Ezek. 34:23,24,</span><span class="font5"> A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">David</span><span class="font5"> means “beloved; dear”, and it designates the beloved servant whom God would raise up to be the “one shepherd” and prince over the sheep. That One is Jesus Christ, who was born of David’s royal lineage. Though he was not named David by his earthly caretakers, yet the name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">David</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Beloved</span><span class="font5"> applies to him, because he proved himself to be the beloved Son of God. Just a few days after he rode astride the ass into ancient Jerusalem he was nailed to a tree, but on the third day thereafter God showed he loved this faithful martyr of His. God set him up forever as the “one shepherd” by raising him from death up to the highest heavens, to be next to Jehovah God himself, even at his right hand.—Eph. 1: 20-23.

<p><span class="font5">The Christian remnant know it is necessary to please the Lord, and especially now, because now he is at the temple of God for the judgment of all members of the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) Since his arrival at the temple A.D. 1918 they are all appearing “before the judgment seat of Christ”. How they use their bodies and the members thereof is important, because on this their final judgment with the Lord as Judge will depend. Only by doing good according to Jehovah’s commandments will they be approved at death and be awarded the glorious resurrection-change. To do that which is bad through failure to be a faithful witness now for Jehovah’s name and kingdom means everlasting destruction at the hands of his Judge and Executioner. No one doing bad will escape destruction at Armageddon and enter life in the new world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is a grand privilege to be now a witness of God Jehovah, bearing his name and being entrusted with his message for proclamation to distressed humanity. The wicked, hypocritical religionists of Christendom are not thus favored. God withholds this privilege from them. They do not accept and apply to themselves the instruction and discipline which they read in the Holy Bible. And when Jehovah God raises up his faithful covenant-keepers to bear witness to his Word, the wicked show no love for the truth. Despite their oily professions with their mouths, they show hate for divine instruction and reproof by tossing God’s Word over their shoulder and turning their back on it and trying to censor and stifle His witnesses. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister.—Ex. 40:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointing of the tabernacle and its furniture and of the altar and its vessels, and of the laver and its base, and then of High Priest Aaron, was a sanctifying action. That is, it set aside to God’s exclusive use and service the things anointed. Hence Aaron anointed was the sanctified one. The name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mashiahh, </span><span class="font5">or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Messiah,</span><span class="font5"> was applied to him. (Lev. 4:3,5) This name Messiah or Christ meant not only that he is Jehovah’s anointed one, but also that, because the anointing was done to sanctify, he was the sanctified one. The anointing was a symbol of God’s holy spirit or active force. Since the oil sanctified in a pictorial way, the spirit or active force of God is what sanctifies his true High Priest, Christ Jesus, in the true way. As the begotten Son of God he was anointed with his Father’s spirit at Jordan and was thus set apart to the sacred work that God purposed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, . . . to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy.—Dan. 9:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By Messiah’s death on the tree a reconciliation of repentant believers is provided. A propitiatory covering is drawn over their sins. Thus the way is opened for their justification with God. This is what is signified by “everlasting righteousness”. It will procure everlasting life to the justified one. Hence Messiah’s coming and being cut off in death at God’s appointed time seals up this vision and prophecy by Gabriel, as well as all the other inspired prophecies, as being true and from God. It stamps them with the seal of divine backing as being from one divine source and not from erring man. It seals up the vision and prophecy as being restricted to Messiah because of finding their fulfillment in him and his work. Their interpretation is found in him, and no one else.

<p><span class="font5">The field is the world, said Jesus, and this is a harvest in all the inhabited earth. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sharp sickle</span><span class="font5"> by which the Harvester gets this reaping of his wheat class done, therefore, is the Kingdom message, sharpened by all the facts and truths which have been revealed about it since A.D. 1914. To show that this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sharp sickle</span><span class="font5"> of the message of Jehovah’s established kingdom would be slashing away earth-wide during the harvest period down to its final end, Jesus followed up his prediction of World War I by his prophecy recorded at Matthew 24:14. That prophecy has been going into reality from and after A.D. 1919 by Jehovah’s witnesses’ publishing in all nations the glad fact that His kingdom by Christ Jesus is set up.

<p><span class="font5">Thus the people’s sanctifying of themselves consisted of cleansing themselves, that they might have clean consciences and their minds might be off all the fleshly appetites as they saw God manifest himself on the third day. Such sanctification was a purification from what displeased the eyes of the Lord. For this reason the Hebrew word for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify</span><span class="font5"> is sometimes used simply to mean purifying or cleansing. (2 Sam. 11:4) In view of what was coming according to the advance notice given, the sanctification was also a preparation for the glorious event. Hence, too, the Hebrew word is sometimes used to mean simply </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to prepare.</span><span class="font5"> (Num. 11:18; Joel 3: 9,10; Jer. 51: 27, 28) In a holy sense, then, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sanctify</span><span class="font5"> means also to set and equip ourselves to do the work God’s will assigns. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">My righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations.—Isa. 51:8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By enduring the reproaches from men, we have the honor of sharing with Christ in vindicating Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and His holy name. Such a wise course of ours makes Jehovah’s heart glad; for it gives him something with which to answer the wicked challenger, Satan, who has stirred up all the reproaches against him. (Prov. 27:11) Such reproaches are at most of a short term now; they will perish and cease with the death and destruction of all enemies of God and of his sovereignty. But all the while that men thus reproach and revile us, we are blessed, because God pronounces us to be right and approves us, and he extends to us the benefits of his salvation by Jesus Christ. (Matt. 5:10,11) This righteous standing with Him continues on forever after our reproached estate among worldly men will have passed away. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Lust of the eye finds its root in the heart or in the mind, which gives inclination to the selfish one. (Matt. 15:19,20) In his words above Jesus declared that radical or thorough-going action should be taken by the one who finds in himself wrong desire, which cleaves to him as tight as his own right eye or right hand. Better would it be to rout out, even with keen pain to one’s selfish feelings, that unclean, worldly desire than to let it cleave to one and cause one to stumble into wrongdoing. Not only one’s personal salvation is tied up with the matter, but, higher still, the vindication of God’s name by the keeping of one’s integrity to Jehovah God through faithful obedience to Him is involved also.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect, . . . the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience.—Heb. 9:9,14, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ faithful course as High Priest results in perfection for his obedient followers who are made a part of Abraham’s seed as sons of God. How? Because it gives them a real cleansing from sin through the blood of his sacrifice. Thus they are given a clean conscience before God, or a freedom from consciousness of sin and from condemnation to death in God’s sight. This was not possible by the animal sacrifices that the Levite priests of Aaron’s house offered in the first or typical tabernacle. (Heb. 9:8-14) Being perfected thus in conscience, evidently Christ’s obedient followers are “justified” by God and through Jesus’ blood and because of their faith. Condemnation has been lifted from them. They have a perfect standing before God according to the flesh. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The first Bible translation, the Greek Septuagint Version </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(LXX),</span><span class="font5"> calls this ram the “ram of completing or perfecting”, because it pictured God’s means for perfecting or qualifying his priesthood, namely, Jesus’ sacrifice. It filled their hands full of power and authority to serve as His priests, and it filled their hands full of that which they could acceptably offer to Him in sacrifice. This gave them a standing with God as genuine, divinely recognized priests. So Aaron and his sons, in seeking a completion or perfecting of their installation into office, laid their hands upon the head of the ram of installation, the “ram of consecration”. This foreshadowed (1) that Jesus confesses the real sacrifice as his own and (2) that his followers confess that his sacrifice was offered for them that they might get the benefits opening up the way for them into the priesthood.

<p><span class="font5">By raising Jesus from the dead and exalting him to the right hand of the Majesty on high, Jehovah gave life and power to the gospel or good news. Without His intervention when Jesus lay lifeless in the tomb the gospel would have failed. Hence the fact stands forth with brilliance that the gospel belongs to God Jehovah and originated with him. It is true that his Word speaks of “Christ’s gospel” and “the gospel of Jesus Christ”; but that does not separate the gospel from Jehovah God. The gospel is thus spoken of properly, because it deals with Christ, who is the divine agent to bring the blessings .promised in the gospel. He is the “seed of Abraham” in whom all the families and nations of the earth are to be blessed. Properly, then, the gospel is preached “in his name”.

We must keep our mental affections, our love, fixed upon him and his glorious Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. To do all this, we cannot side-step having to watch and guard our hearts and minds against everything that lifts itself up and exalts itself against the knowledge of God. By increasing our knowledge of him through studying his Word privately and in company with others; and then by taking him at his Word and abiding by it, we shall have our hearts enlarged with love for him.

That they at once decided to do God’s will as now revealed is shown by the spirit’s falling on them all without their making any formal confession of faith to Peter. Those whom God openly consecrated by His spirit no one could lawfully prevent from being baptized.

This does not say that other sheeplike ones are not saved to life eternal, but it means that only the spiritual heirs of God and jointheirs with Christ Jesus are in this exclusive fold. Only Messiah, the Christ, could be admitted to this fold rightfully to take charge of such sheep; and it was to sheep of this class, or in line for this inheritance, that John the Baptist admitted Christ Jesus.

In living up to this obligation they must not fail to be in word and action what they are today known as, namely, witnesses of Jehovah of hosts, who now reigns by his King Christ Jesus in the heavenly capital, Zion. Therefore they must appear prominently before all nations and peoples, with absolute fearlessness against the world conspiracy of this postwar era. By taking a course contrary to the popular current they will be signs and wonders much spoken against and attacked upon all sides. But by their complete separateness from worldly conspiracies and by outspoken devotedness to Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ they will be signs that God’s vengeance is speedily coming upon all the conspirators and that he will preserve his remnant and their companions.

Next morning, at sunrise, the angels hurried Lot and his three fellow refugees out of Sodom to a place of security and refuge. His wife, forgetting the fear of Jehovah, looked back to Sodom and got caught in the snares of death.

God originated and proposed this covenant, the “new covenant”, over Christ Jesus’ perfect sacrifice; and the purpose of this covenant is to take out of the nations a people for Jehovah’s name, to wit, God’s “holy nation” of spiritual Israel. God has a definite time for taking men into this covenant through the “one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus”. It is not for the believer on earth to stipulate, but it is for God to do His own will and determine which ones of those dedicating themselves to him to take into His covenant over Christ’s sacrifice.

His written Word is not mere myth, legend, supposition and unproved theory. It is the abiding truth which the test of time and the further progress of history and of knowledge will never be able to overthrow but will be certain to confirm down to every jot and tittle.

<p><span class="font5">Since the Bible speaks of it as “the gospel of Christ”, why should any Christians put themselves forward as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> witnesses? The answer is: that a Christian could not be a faithful witness of Jehovah God without also giving testimony to His Son. Because God the Father framed his purpose about his beloved Son and then gave such decisive evidence that he is Christ, a believer in God who acts as His witness cannot be true to God or be telling the whole truth if he ignores the testimony that God has given. He would be ignoring God’s Chief Servant. True Christians will not do this. Paul says that God has highly exalted his Son above alt the rest of creation. Why ? Is it to give the chief honors to Christ Jesus? Not at all, for the apostle Paul adds the climax to his statement by saying, “to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:9-11) Primarily, then, whose witness was Paul by giving such testimony?

<p><span class="font5">There is only a remnant yet on earth of Christians who are anointed with God’s spirit and who therefore have the pledge of a resurrection out of death to life in the heavens at home with the glorified Lord. Jesus Christ has come into the Kingdom since God’s establishment thereof A.D. 1914; yet Christ Jesus is unseen, being in the spirit, whereas the remnant are yet in the flesh and hence absent from him in this respect. But at death they do not expect to go into a long sleep of ‘nakedness’ as those did who died ahead of the Kingdom’s establishment and the coming of the Lord to the temple A.D. 1918. According to Scripture the remnant will not sleep on dying in faithfulness. They will instantaneously be raised to life in the spirit, being “changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye”, and thus finally they will be resident or “at home” with their Lord.—1 Cor. 15: 51, 52.

The pressing question of the day is, therefore, this: Do the peoples, both Jews and Gentiles, care to know the Shepherd Christ Jesus as the Egyptians learned to know the shepherd Moses or do they want to know Him as God’s chosen nation came to know Moses ? When Moses stretched out his shepherd’s rod over Egypt it brought devastating plagues, and, when raised against Pharaoh at the Red sea, it brought the waters of the sea over all the hosts of Pharaoh and destroyed them.

<p><span class="font5">This shows that the blessing consists in making sinful men turn away from their wickedness and relieving them of the death-dealing effects of this sin-born condition and thus bringing them into relationship with Jehovah God, the great Blesser through Jesus Christ. Paul shows that some would be blessed with the high privilege of being joined with Christ Jesus in the congregation where neither Jew nor Gentile is discriminated against, and adds: “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Gal. 3:16,27-29) By joining these to Christ in the Kingdom the promised Seed of Abraham becomes as the stars and sands for multitude.

Thenceforth he taught exclusively, by preaching the good news or gospel of the kingdom of God. Before he taught his townspeople in their synagogue at Nazareth he called their attention to the teaching mission of the Messiah or Christ.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus was made God’s High Priest with the divine oath and is therefore so much better than the Levitical priests of the old law covenant. (Heb. 7: 21-27) At the vanishing away of the old law covenant A.D. 33 came in the new covenant with its better sacrifice, its superior priesthood and mediator, its better promises, and a new nation with greater blessings and opportunities. Pointing to the blessing of actual justification that comes to this new nation through the one sacrifice of the greater Mediator and High Priest, Jesus Christ, the apostle says: “By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. . . . then saith he, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.” (Heb. 10:14-18, AA'.F.) Jesus’ sacrifice, therefore, needs no repeating. </span><span class="font6">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Neither fearing the oppressor’s fury in the future nor sorrowing or sighing over sufferings that are past, Jehovah’s faithful ones of integrity push joyfully on with their activities. No creatures, demon or human, shall close their mouths, because God has put his words in their mouth, to proclaim his name and his kingdom, and they have his protection while doing so. This is because He has planted and spread forth the “new heavens” of the new world. Hence Christ reigns in Jehovah’s name and Satan and his demons have been cast down from their erstwhile high position in the realms above. The remnant and their faithful companions of good-will are marching to a “new earth”, a new visible organization of righteousness founded by Jehovah God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus the Israelites were baptized by Jehovah, “all baptized unto Moses in the cloud [above them] and in the sea [on either side].” (1 Cor. 10:1, 2) On the other hand, the Devil’s hosts were baptized in a terrific destruction; and the Israelites despoiled the bodies of those washed ashore dead. These Israelites became the living witnesses of Jehovah concerning his supremacy and his sovereignty and Godship. Under the leadership of Moses, seconded by his sister Miriam, all the delivered Israelites joined in singing. Theirs was a song of praise to their Savior, Jehovah God, and it ended upon the high theme: “Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.” (Ex. 15:18, A.S.V.)

<p><span class="font5">Because God’s gracious Word is necessary to upbuild them and keep them clean from the world and in line for the Kingdom inheritance, the apostle said in farewell to Christ’s brothers: “I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.” (Acts 20:32) We must not only believe on this Word in order to keep our hope bright but must also preach and declare that Word to others and make known to them the only hope for life and salvation. If we are to do so, we dare not yield to any terror from men who threaten us with sufferings, but our hearts must love God and his Christ and must fear these only. In our hearts we must set apart and regard as holy Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and then obey them and show forth their praises, regardless of the sufferings that this course brings.

<p><span class="font5">So, too, Christ’s anointed followers join him in serving God with zeal, with attentiveness of mind and pure hearts, and with the strength of their united shoulders. Everything they can offer to God really comes through Christ Jesus, who is both the High Priest and the Greater Moses. From Christ Jesus they receive the testimony, or the “fruits”, of the Kingdom, and then, in the power of God’s spirit and free from the sinful leaven of this world, they bear forth the Kingdom fruits to the people of good-will for their spiritual food. All this they continually wave before God in his service, to be at last consumed in His service. It is “for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the Lord”. (29:25) Its acceptableness to God continually marks and distinguishes his true priesthood who serve him through Christ Jesus. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The fact that the sheep </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">heard</span><span class="font5"> his voice testifies that Jesus preached. The unbelievers did not respond to his voice of Kingdom proclamation and invitation. (John 10: 26, 27) The believing sheep hear the Shepherd’s voice because they are of and for the truth of the Kingdom. Their Shepherd said to a governor of a kingdom of this world: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) The sheep of the “little flock” heard the witness that their Shepherd bore regarding God’s kingdom of the New World, and they followed him in seeking first God’s kingdom and his righteousness. He “goes in front of them” in that he leads them, having set them the right example. He conducts them in safe paths, to good pastures and refreshing waters. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The term </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fatherless</span><span class="font5"> does not necessarily confine itself to little or under-age children that have lost their father in death. It is also used of adult persons who have lost a beloved friend or guardian and caretaker, and even, in reverse, of parents that have been bereft of their children. (John 14:18; 1 Thess. 2: 7,11,17) From heaven the Lord Jesus visited his orphaned or bereaved apostles at Jerusalem by pouring upon them the holy spirit as a comforter or helper at Pentecost. (Acts 2:1-33) Correspondingly now, those whose worship of God is not vain, impure or defiled must visit with help and comfort both the afflicted widows and also the fatherless or bereaved ones in their need of comfort and help, especially spiritually. Christendom’s religion in particular has left the peoples bereaved, and the best way to visit them is with the comforting message of God’s kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Publicly, shewing by the scriptures.—Acts 18:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In quoting from Hebrew Scripture the apostles did not consider themselves to be pushing aside the authority of Jesus and placing the authority of the Hebrew Scriptures ahead of Christ’s authority. Well, then, were they guilty of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bibliolatry</span><span class="font5"> toward the books of the Hebrew Scriptures? Not at all. If Jesus’ own respect for and reference to them was not a case of idolatry of the Bible, then the copy of his example by his apostles and disciples in quoting and appealing to the authority of the Hebrew Scriptures is no such thing either. (Acts 28: 23) Neither is it such a thing in the ease of Jehovah’s witnesses, whose publications and verbal speeches quote freely and abundantly from the inspired Greek Scriptures as well as from the Hebrew. To ignore the Scriptures and to deny possession of them to others means to deprive ourselves and others of their comfort and admonition. Of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">such</span><span class="font5"> a deprivation we will never be guilty. We will continue to circulate Bibles and push its study.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Whoever will follow me, let him deny himself and take up his yoke, and come with me.—Matt. 16:24, Torrey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus explained just what our going in the way of consecration to God means. To go the same consecrated way that Jesus went, we must first of all deny or renounce ourselves, not caring whether it means human death to ourselves. We do not put our own selfish human life first, but we say No to ourselves and refuse to live longer to self-will, our selfish will, but solemnly agree to live to the will of God, to which Christ Jesus our chosen Leader lived. Following Christ Jesus faithfully is not according to one’s selfish will or the will of this world. The one that denies himself must thereafter become yoked with Jesus to share with him in working at the work of Jehovah God the Father. Thus doing, one follows Christ Jesus and leads a consecrated life. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Psalm 50: 5 was written, that which Jehovah God recognized as the “covenant with me by sacrifice” was the law covenant which all the nation of Israel made with him through Moses. Except that Moses undertook individually to make the covenant with Jehovah for the Israelite nation as their mediator, this “covenant by sacrifice” was not made with each and every individual Israelite separately. It was not made with any individual Israelites, but was made with the entire nation through the mediator Moses. No individual Israelite made an individual or personal covenant with Jehovah God by a sacrifice of his personal own self. The nation, through its representative elder men, declared in favor of this agreement with Jehovah God. And there was one passover lamb for each household when making the covenant in Egypt, and one set of sacrifices for the entire nation when dedicating the covenant at Mount Sinai or Horeb.

<p><span class="font5">The above rule of conduct is contrary to the worldly rich who trust in material wealth to redeem them from destruction. The rich and powerful ones of this world perish like brute beasts in their lack of understanding, and the understanding of God’s Word makes us different from them. Hence our desires and affections should be centered upon understanding God’s purposes and our relationship to Him. If we understand with our minds, and if our hearts assent to such understanding, then we can believe, because we are persuaded from within and are convinced that God’s Word is true. Then we shall confess God and his kingdom before men. The importance of this is stated in the rule of action at Romans 10:10: “With the heart man be-lieveth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Messenger, Christ Jesus, published peace to God’s remnant on earth, now that they had repented from failure in his service and now that his anger against them had passed. He published peace also to persons out of all nations who rejoiced at the restoration of Zion’s remnant and who turned with good-will to Jehovah as God and to Zion as His Theocratic organization ; yea, “on earth peace to men of good will.” The Messenger brought glad tidings of good things due to come henceforth to God’s visible organization of faithful witnesses on earth, in fulfillment of the good promises of His Word. “And there shall be no more curse.” (Rev. 22:3) The Messenger published salvation.

Living as he did during the six hundred years prior to the flood, he saw a number of generations born to this earth and these were his contemporaries. Amid all these corrupt, ungodly generations or contemporaries Noah remained perfect toward God in keeping his integrity toward Him. That is, Noah never wavered in faith toward God. He never fell into worshiping any of the false gods of the day. He acted with faith in the true God and preached righteousness and kept as close to God as he could by prayer, by offering sacrifices and by looking for the promised Seed of God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman.</span><span class="font5"> In these respects he could meet God’s requirements blamelessly, despite his natural blemishes and shortcomings in the flesh.

And in rejecting him as Jehovah’s Heir of the Kingdom covenant they reject Jehovah himself.

(Deut. 6:4-7) Parents must be every-day teachers and day-long instructors of the children in the things of God. Instructions to Christian parents and children are plain in the writings of Christ’s apostles. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord.” (Eph. 6:1) When a father and mother give teaching concerning God and his Word, they are “in the Lord” and should be obeyed, because then the disobedience is not simply against the father and mother but against the Lord.

All such was for a proof of his integrity to God, testing whether the Devil could turn him into rebellion against God. But just as the rich fat and inward organs of the sin-offering victim were burned with divine acceptance upon the altar while the carcass was burned outside the camp, Jesus was faithful to God in his inward parts while he was undergoing all such reproach, abuse and suffering even to the death.

The sheep regard not the voice of “strangers” who come with a message not in harmony with Jehovah’s pure worship nor in the interest of the kingdom which vindicates God’s holy name. They know it is dangerous to listen to such strangers and to come under their power and influence.

But this time Jehovah’s witnesses did not, as in 1918, cringe before the fury of the oppressor with his terrorism by use of prisons, concentration camps, mob rule, bans and proscriptions, and violent persecutions. Now, in this year 1947, we ask, Where is the fury of the Nazi-Fascist oppressor who made ready to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses? It has met defeat and come to nought, because these feared the Creator of the New World of righteousness, whose name is Jehovah. His arm upheld them. It enabled them to stand fast in their integrity toward his rightful sovereignty. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Abel sought a way back into peaceful relationship with God. The blood of the victim which he sacrificed in approaching Him bore witness to God’s purpose, in due time, to supply the “blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel”. (Heb. 12:24) It is certain that the sinners, Adam and Eve, did not consecrate Abel, their second-born son, to God. Abel, acting on his own faith in God’s promise in Eden, took the step for himself. He came to God and consecrated himself. At this time Abel was possibly over one hundred years old (Gen. 4:25; 5:3,4) and in the matter of sacrificing on the altar he acted as a priest for his family which he brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Abel kept his consecration vow faithfully till death, and God counted him righteous. Although dead, Abel by his example still speaks in witness to God.—Heb. 11:4.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the chief and topmost one of God’s heavens, and he as representative of God’s holy heavens declares Jehovah’s righteousness. He declares God’s faithfulness to His part of the covenant by sacrifice. He declares also God’s impartialness in dealing with the other parties to the covenant, and his strict justice and his adherence to the rules of the divine court. The court is now set, with a full courtroom from heaven and earth; and now a pause occurs, as denoted by the word “Selah”. Jehovah is not afraid of having the matter at issue fully aired to all heaven and earth. Aye, let all the universe get in on the news, for, after all the exposures and frank discussion and raging of the controversy, the end result will be that Jehovah’s judicial fairness and impartiality will be enhanced and his side of the covenant by sacrifice will be vindicated. Only the religionists are in favor of a censorship. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

Otherwise, Jehovah’s Judge at the temple will have something to hold against us, and the outcome will be serious, if we do not soon recover. (Rev. 2:4, 5) Then God will refuse to look on us with favor, even if we do engage in an outward form of worship of Him. We must, therefore, be faithful to God’s organization, which is compared to a clean woman. We must not let our love toward her cool and be weaned away and back to the worldly organization, Babylon, which is compared to a heathen woman who is an unclean devil-worshiper. Be not faithless.

<p><span class="font5">The dust pictures the state of being under the feet of the enemy organization that had overthrown the organization of God’s consecrated people and taken it captive. Dust itself is dry, worthless, thrown on the head in mourning, and is food fit for only that Old Serpent, the Devil, to bite in defeat. From such dust Jehovah commanded his remnant in 1919 to shake themselves loose. He sent them this command by his newly installed King, the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, whom He enthroned in 1914 and sent to the temple in 1918. Now they are commanded to recognize their Godgiven rights and liberty as His “faithful and wise servant” and to shake themselves loose from the dry, worthless, unnourishing, mournful things of the Devil’s organization. They should not let that Babylonish organization keep them occupied in such death-dealing things and away from an upright, respectable and free part in Jehovah’s service.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So let us keep the festival, . . . ivith the unleavened bread of purity and truth.-l Cor. 5:8, An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unleavened state of the bread signifies purity. The Israelites began eating this bread when parting company with Egypt and its servitude to Satan’s visible organization. Like those Israelites, so Jehovah’s consecrated people must now be clean from the leaven of this world. Its leaven represents its teachings, its habits, its standards, and its practices. It represents religion, as is shown by Jesus’ warning concerning the leaders who were devotees of “the Jews’ religion”. He said: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . . . the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” (Matt. 16:6,12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Being an unleavened lump symbolizes that we must be no part of this world and have none of it among us.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before[hand] the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.—Gal. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present perfection of relationship with God is the blessing which comes to the faithful believers through the Seed of Abraham, Christ Jesus. “So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.” (Gal. 3:9) This blessing through the Seed of Abraham is, of course, made complete for these sons of God when he brings them to glory by resurrecting them from the dead. These faithful dead are the ones concerning whom it is written: “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. ... as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.” (1 Cor. 15:44,49) Thus, at the resurrection, these are perfected or consecrated and inaugurated into God’s sacred service in the heavens in His glorious presence. This final perfecting begins to take place at Christ’s coming to the temple. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the approaching battle of Armageddon Jehovah by Christ Jesus will further prove that he is true. He will give the official interpretation to his written Word by fulfilling it and thereby make even his enemies to see that “Thy word is truth”. He will do so by letting go his long-predicted wrath against them, to destroy all of Satan’s organization, political, commercial, religious and demonic. At the same time he will deliver all those who abide by his Word and who uphold his supreme authority and universal sovereignty. At his victory for truth and righteousness all persons of good-will out of all nations will be glad with inexpressible gladness and shall know Jehovah as the God of truth as never before.

<p><span class="font5">The “male child”, or the Kingdom that it symbolizes, has been brought to birth and been put on the throne by divine power. The wielding of the iron staff will be done by the One whom Jehovah appoints to shepherd the nations, and it will not be to treat the nations in tenderness like sheep. The worldly nations will see the side of the Shepherd that will be very hard upon them, whereas the sheeplike people will see His tender side and will receive His loving care and protection. Men and women who do not want to feel the iron staff together with the nations must interest themselves in learning what to do now in order to come under the Shepherd’s keeping. The rule of the rod of iron is certain, and this staff is irresistible by the nations, even with their atomic bomb. Jehovah God has decreed this final destiny to the nations.

<p><span class="font5">The Sower of the good seed is the Greatest in the kingdom of God. That one is God’s Anointed King, Christ Jesus. He is the One who purchases the symbolic “good seed” by giving his life for God’s “sheep”, and therefore God his Father gave and supplied him the “good seed”. (John 10:29; 17: 6-12) Jehovah God, by his Word written and preached, teaches and draws men to Jesus and thus gives them to him. Jesus taught and preached God’s Word. The Kingdom of heaven is good, and its children are pictured as “good seed”. They are the seed of God. They are children of God, being begotten by his spirit to become his spiritual children and thereby heirs of the heavenly kingdom with Christ. But until they enter that invisible kingdom with Christ by a resurrection from death they are members of God’s visible organization.

<p><span class="font5">God is with those who are on the side of the royal Inheritor of his Kingdom covenant. No strongly girded world-union, no counsel, plan or plot, and no word of men of this world, shall prosper and succeed against His now reigning King of His new world. We accept in all good faith the inspired proverb which says: “There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Jehovah. The [war-] horse is prepared against the day of battle; but victory is of Jehovah.” (Prov. 21:30,31, A.S.V.) In the battle of Armageddon toward which all the worldly nations are marching, the plans, plots, schemes and boastful words of the old-world organizers will not stand. They will come to nothing. Jehovah God will gain the victory for the new world which He creates by his kingdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 4:18, Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not the death of the human body, but the resurrection from the dead, is the doorway by which each tried and tested faithful Christian enters into the heavenly glories and honor with Christ Jesus, the reigning Son of God. The loyal Christian holds fast to God’s appointed work and endures all the afflictions, persecutions and sufferings, and even death, that come on such account from the Devil’s servants. Thereby he proves himself worthy through Christ of the heavenly Kingdom glories which God has reserved for his faithful servants. Such hope of things not seen with the natural eye has sustaining power. So, if we see that what is temporal or temporary is wasting away and about to die we need not worry. Our hope is of eternal glorious things in a new world. There is no comparison between the two sets of things. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

Moreover, since Satan the Devil is “the prince of this world”, the setting apart means separating from this present wicked world, in order to be clean and acceptable to Jehovah God. But let us clearly understand that separateness from this world does not by any means signify being shut up and isolated in any religious monastery or convent; for such religious institutions are not of God, but are a part of this world. Those who hole themselves up in monasteries and nunneries are not following the holy example and instructions of Jesus, who mingled most freely with the people. They are consecrated to a religious system or mode of life, but not to Jehovah God. Their course of life does not sanctify to Him.

<p><span class="font5">Who was the porter that opened to Christ Jesus when he came to his sheep as their shepherd ? The Scripture definitely shows who it was that opened the door wide to the anointed, baptized Jesus and let him have free entrance among the Israelite sheep. This doorkeeper or porter was John the Baptist. John was expecting the Shepherd to come. In fact, he was preparing the sheep to receive their God-appointed Shepherd at his coming. John did not claim the sheep as his own, but preached God’s Word to the sheep so as to make clear to their understanding who was the One sent of God. John did not try to play the part of a thief and to steal the “sheep” for himself to fatten himself on his followers. (John 1:19-27) John exercised a temporary supervision over Jehovah’s sheep like a porter or doorkeeper of the fold. He opened the door wide to allow Jesus free access to the sheep gathered.

<p><span class="font5">King David the psalmist acknowledged that this coming priest would be a King higher even than himself, for David spoke of this future Melchizedekian priest as “my Lord”. Also this coming King would not disappear off the scene as the ancient Melchizedek did, because Jehovah God swore that this new King greater than David should be a “priest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for ever”.</span><span class="font5"> He would have an imperishable priesthood. His priesthood would not be passed on to any successor nor handed over to any vicar or vicegerent on earth, but would always be his because of living forever. Since this Messianic priest was to arise after the order or rank of Melehize-dek, it proves that the Levitic priesthood of Aaron was to be done away with on Messiah’s coming.

<p><span class="font5">The thought here is that those once womanly and hence weak would become strong and active like men. This came to pass with the faithful remnant from and after 1919 by the spirit of God poured out on them. Instead of having Jehovah God woo and seek after them, they have wooed and hung around Him, the great </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">husband</span><span class="font5"> of his universal organization. They have wooed and cleaved to Christ Jesus, the Bridegroom to his chureh. With manly courage they have since stood up boldly before all the world to confess Jehovah’s name and to proclaim the glad tidings of his kingdom now set up in the hands of his King, Christ Jesus. The world-wide testimony to the Kingdom which they have given since is therefore something new in this twentieth century, something the like of which this world has never before seen.

(Gen. 3:15) Ever since then men with faith in God have looked for Messiah’s coming. They have wanted to identify him that they might accept and follow him, out of honor to Jehovah God who sent him. To help toward this identification God himself had to give testimony in advance concerning Messiah, for God alone knew who he would be and what would be his course on earth. God gave such prophetic testimony about Messiah or Christ by his heavenly angels and also by his faithful prophets on earth. Hence he used such prophets to bear testimony to Christ. They were witnesses </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">unto</span><span class="font5"> Christ, but this does not mean they were not also witnesses of Jehovah.

It is the expression used to refer to God’s true sanctuary. This is not made with human hands. It is God’s building, his true temple made up of Jesus Christ as Foundation and Chief Corner Stone and of all his justified footstep followers as “living stones”. (Eph. 2:20-22) At Pentecost, about three and a half years after Jesus’ anointing, the holy spirit of anointing came upon his first Jewish followers. Some time later the same spirit of anointing came upon the first non-Jewish or Gentile believers at the home of Cornelius. At the latest, it must have been at the close of the seventy weeks A.D. 36 that this first anointing of the Gentile members of the sanctuary class took place.—Acts 10.

It is by filling the heart and mind with the knowledge of God Almighty and his purposes and his protective power. Let us keep before us the illustration of the human heart. Our earthly life depends upon our nourishment that is supplied to the various organs and tissues of the human body. This nutritious food is found in the blood, which is pumped to the organs and tissues by the central pumping organ, the heart. Like the various tissues and organs of the body which depend upon the blood to strengthen them with nourishment, so we as Christians serving Jehovah need spiritual nourishment to keep strong to do his work boldly and gladly. Our mind, like the heart, is the organ or faculty to pump us the nourishment which keeps us strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.

<p><span class="font5">And Jehovah’s witnesses have not drunk it again, no, not even during 1933-1945. Why not? Because in this case they pleased the Lord God by valiantly fighting for their freedom and right to worship him as commanded in his Holy Word, thus holding fast their integrity to him. They did not, as in 1918, bend over in abject subservience when worldly authorities, Nazi, Fascist or democratic, said to them: ‘‘Bow down, that we may go over!” Without mincing words they declared: “We must obey God rather than men.” They did not quit serving him or stop fulfilling their ordination from him to preach.

But this he-goat pictured his sacrifice as bringing redemption from sin to all believing men of good-will outside the church of Jesus’ underpriests or anointed followers. The other animal victims that both Aaron and the non-Levitical tribes brought also pictured the one and only sacrifice of Jesus, but pictured it from the standpoints as to what it accomplishes.

Jesus was of the royal tribe of Judah, and not of the tribe of Levi, lienee he could not consecrate himself to render special work at the temple of Jerusalem like those Levites. At thirty years of age he left Nazareth and his carpenter shop. Why? Evidently he now made a full consecration to God and chose the interests of God’s kingdom first. He left Nazareth, to apply the rest of his earthly life entirely and exclusively to doing a higher work than carpentering, God’s kingdom work. Thus his individual consecration consisted in setting himself apart to doing God’s will in connection with the Kingdom. He went to John, the announcer of that kingdom, in order to outwardly signify or symbolize that consecration and to seek divine evidence or indication of God’s acceptance of his consecration.

But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” (Heb. 13:15,16) Giving God the fruit of the lips in continual praise and thanks, and doing good and communicating, means publishing the facts about Jehovah and his purpose, and communicating to the suffering bewildered people the Kingdom gospel. When dedicating themselves to God, Jehovah’s witnesses vowed obedience to His will. Now they must fulfill their vows by keeping his commandments through Christ and announcing to all men His kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Visiting the fatherless and the widows in their affliction is a requirement to pure, undefiled worship. There is a good reason why. It is because God is the Defender and Caretaker of the fatherless and widows. (Ps. 68:5; 146: 9) In his law given to Israel he strongly emphasized considerate care and protection of the helpless widows and fatherless children. (Ex. 22: 2224; Deut. 24:17) When his covenant people neglected or positively violated his provisions in behalf of these helpless and needy ones, Jehovah at once raised objection by his prophets. (Isa. 1:16-18) An outward form of worship of God combined with oppression and neglect toward the fatherless and widows is not a pure and undefiled worship of God. Jesus condemned the robbery and injustice to widows and orphans in his day. (Matt. 23:14) Now, since his coming to God’s spiritual temple A.D. 1918, he acts as Jehovah’s swift witness against such oppressors.

For those who seek a way to survive such destruction of the world in order to enter into the blessings of the righteous world of God’s creation a refuge and security must be provided now. Naturally parents who love righteousness desire such refuge and security for their beloved children also. Their desire is not beyond being satisfied. The inspired statement at Proverbs 14: 26 shows that the parents’ fear of Jehovah God plays a great part toward providing such a refuge and security for the children.

By their deliverance from subjection to the enemy’s power, which began in 1919, the remnant of Jehovah’s people knew that he was near.

<p><span class="font5">The tares are religionists who are stumblingblocks and who cause others to stumble into wrong and to commit offense against Christ. They practice iniquity or lawlessness toward God. Why did God permit the offensive and lawless religionists to grow and develop in such overwhelming numbers </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> The purpose is to test the integrity of creatures in order to make manifest who are faithful in their devotion to Jehovah. The issue of His universal sovereignty is here implicated, and those who confess and hold fast to His sovereignty must be shown up in contrast with tares who defy His supremacy and sovereignty. Paul wrote: “I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.”—1 Cor. 11:18,19. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although their pleasing heart condition helped to overcome their fleshly weaknesses or hold in check their inborn sinful tendencies, the faithful men of old were not lifted up to actual perfection physically. None of them were justified to life eternal. Had God thus perfected them or justified them to life eternal, they would not have died. But they looked forward to that blessing. They expected God’s promise thereof to be fulfilled when Messiah, the Christ, should come. But they all lived before his arrival, and hence died without seeing the divine promise realized and experiencing it. In order to open the way to actual perfection, more was needed than perfection or integrity and honesty of heart. There was need of a sacrifice, offered to God to lift off men of such heart condition all disability due to Adam. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Praise him, all ye people. For his mercy is confirmed upon us.—Ps. 116:1,2, Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spiritual Israelites, when taking up this Psalm, are not expressing conceit as if God’s mercy were tied down just to them as spiritual heirs of God’s kingdom. Instead, these witnesses of Jehovah humbly confess up to being objects of his mercy and of his undeserved kindness. But they see and own up that His mercy has come first to them in the divine order of things, thus obligating them to show mercy to all nations and peoples by making a public confession and thus informing others of all nations and peoples about the divine Source of mercy and the Messianic channel of mercy. Persons in all nations hear this public testimony. On hearing the invitation to praise this heavenly Source of mercy, they realize they must now act upon the invitation before Armageddon comes, so as to partake of mercy through the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring.—John 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since A.D. 1931 in particular the Good Shepherd began to bring his “other sheep”. It is because he has caused them to hear his “voice” through his remnant, now bearing the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Since 1931 these witnesses have intensified their educational campaign to instruct the peoples of the nations concerning God’s kingdom by his King whom he has installed. Since that year Jehovah’s witnesses have published and distributed to date in several score of tongues more than a half billion publications. This has resulted in a sharp dividing of the people both pro and con, the “other sheep” class showing themselves to be pro-Kingdom. Hence the Good Shepherd on the throne as King judges them as his sheep who hear his voice. He gathers them to the right side of his throne, separating them from the anti-Kingdom “goats”, whom he gathers to the left side of his throne.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 51:2, An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under ordinary circumstances the remnant seeking Jehovah and his righteousness might be dismayed because of their fewness in 1919 in contrast with the vast magnitude of the work ahead as predicted by the sacred prophecies and as commanded upon them. But the Lord bade them be not discouraged. Look, said he, at Abraham and Sarah. Jehovah promised to make Abraham’s seed by Sarah to be as many as the stars. But at that time Abraham was old and Sarah was aged. Nevertheless, the fulfillment of the covenant promise did not depend on Abraham. It depended upon Almighty God. So by blessing Abraham for his integrity, God multiplied him or made him many. God has now done this toward the spiritual seed of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah, and thus comforted Zion.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.—Heb. 13:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ’s sanctifying blood is something continually to be appreciated as most precious and uncommon, for by it the believer may come regularly to God and confess his sins and be washed clean and be forgiven. It is now the privilege of those justified by his blood to serve as underpriests under Christ Jesus the Chief Priest and to offer up sacrifices of praise to God by acting as His witnesses and publishers of his kingdom. Concerning these privileges which the sanctifying blood of Christ opened up for them, it is written: “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproaches. For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come [the heavenly Jerusalem]. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.”—Heb. 13:13-15.

<p><span class="font5">With merey God has led his faithful remnant baek to their free homeland, their true, harmonious relationship with him as His servants and witnesses. He has done this by making the Kingdom truths plain and also by making comfortable, helpful organization arrangements. Thereby the way back has not been too hard, but the spiritually blind, the ones hobbling along spiritually, and those who have been trying to nourish and bring up others spiritually have been able to travel the road to renewed peaceful relations with God within his Theocratic organization. It has been no dry, parched road; but Kingdom truth like a river of water of life has issued forth from the heavenly throne and has followed and run alongside of the returning remnant all the way. His truth and organization instructions for service have straightened out the road so that no one has reason for stumbling. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul and all his fellow Christians have confidence in the destiny which God has promised them in his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Word. </span><span class="font5">Hence they are willing and well-pleased to have God’s will fulfilled toward them, namely, to be forever away from human life in the flesh, to “be absent from the body”, and to reside and to be present and at home with Christ Jesus in God’s heavenly kingdom. Thus they show they do not desire mere death with its naked condition, unclothed of privileges of serving God. What they desire is to be united with Christ in God’s presence by the resurrection from the dead. And why not? For then they will enter into that “far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” for which they have been proving themselves worthy amid present momentary affliction, just light in comparison.

<p><span class="font5">Eating the flesh of the passover lamb pictures how Christians feed upon Jesus’ sacrifice by following his example and thus being strengthened for God’s service. (John 6:51) Eating the lamb’s flesh with bitter herbs, down there in Egypt, typifies how such believers and followers of Christ suffer the bitterness of persecution and reproach from this wicked world because they are a people for Jehovah’s name and follow the faithful example of the Son of God in declaring God’s name and proclaiming His kingdom. Standing up, girdled and full-shod, while eating the lamb, pictures how these spiritual Israelites are called out of this world and are no part of it but must be separate from its religious, commercial, political organization and must be obediently committed to the Theocratic rule of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">King David sat upon the material “throne of Jehovah” on Zion in Jerusalem. But thereafter, to fulfill His kingdom covenant with David, Jehovah invited Jesus, the Son of David, to sit upon the heavenly throne at the right hand of the Most High God himself. Thus he took his seat in the heavenly Zion or capital organization. Later, when telling of this to John, Christ Jesus as the over comer of this world said: “I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Rev. 3:21) When he thus sat down in the throne, God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5"> that is, God’s organization which is above, brought Jesus Christ forth in a complete sense as her Seed, which Seed had been wounded in the heel by the Serpent but would in God’s predetermined time bruise the head of this Serpent.

<p><span class="font5">To foreshadow that High Priest Jesus’ followers are to be dedicated to righteous, clean work, Aaron’s four sons were clothed with white-linen tunics, and with breeches to cover up any nakedness, and white caps or bonnets were tied on their heads. (Rev. 19: 8) Such priestly garments singled out Aaron’s sons as his assistants; and they picture that Jesus’ followers who are members of his body must be identified by righteousness as his underpriests. They are clothed in his righteousness because Jehovah God has justified them through their faith in Jesus’ blood. Besides having this righteousness of Christ imputed to them, they must serve God’s righteous cause, seeking first God’s kingdom and his righteousness. Serving righteousness includes preaching the glad tidings of God’s kingdom for men of good-will to hear.—Matt. 6:33. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We refuse to add religious traditions as necessary and complementary to God’s written Word, for we keep in mind God’s warning through his wise man. Possession by a religious organization of a mass of religious traditions which contradict and nullify God’s written Word, instead of proving such organization to be “at all times the depositary of all truth”, proves it is the depositary of errors, lies and doctrines of demons. Because the Jewish religious organization became such a depositary of religious traditions of the elders and ancients, Jesus said to Jerusalem in her religious bondage: “Behold, your house shall be left to you, desolate.” (Matt. 23:38, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5"> Jesus rejected her from being the organization with which to deposit the further revelation of divine truth.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses turn deaf ears to the political and religious propaganda that pulls peoples into the present world-conspiracy. They take careful heed to the testimony and law which the Lord God has provided for the disciples of his anointed King in these days. Jehovah’s testimony by Isaiah concerning all these things and His law of action to govern our course of conduct when these things come true have been faithfully preserved for us. They have been bound up and sealed as the exclusive treasure of His witnesses under Christ. Christendom does not hold and understand such law and testimony. Hence Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones now found to be making known such law and testimony, which He has committed to them for use now. By so doing, they make such law and testimony known to all nations for a witness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Whether now God will consecrate a believer by anointing him with the spirit to be a king and priest with Christ is something for God to determine. The baptized believer exercises no choice. He lays down no conditions of a selfish kind before God, but submits himself to do and to have done whatever is the future will of God for him. If now God does not will to consecrate the believer to be in the heavenly Kingdom class with Christ, then God will reveal that to such one and he will bow to the divine will and be pleased to serve him forever in hope of eternal life on earth under the Kingdom. Personal consecration is not to last to any certain date, but is forever and is not revocable. Not carrying it out faithfully will result in one’s destruction. Being once made, consecration needs no renewing, for its obligations upon us continue. Faithful performance of our consecration means eternal life in the wondrous new world.

<p><span class="font5">The commission of Jehovah’s witnesses, backed up by his invisible spirit, is that they should “bind up the brokenhearted” by God’s Word. They are commanded: “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.” (Isa. 35: 3, 4; Heb. 12:12,13) We are able to fulfill this assigned duty in behalf of others because we rest ourselves upon God and his Word and are therefore ourselves strong. Sizing up the tremendous power and combined forces of our enemies, demons and humans, and then, besides that, looking at our weak arm of flesh and comparative fewness of numbers, our heart would melt within us.

<p><span class="font5">Moses evidently put his own hands beneath those of the priests as they waved the things of the consecration offering to and fro before the Lord. To conform to this picture, Christ Jesus was installed as High Priest in order to present the precious value of his sacrifice to God; and everything in connection with that sacrifice he waved before Jehovah God in a continual presentation. In the picture the fat and vital organs of the installation ram were waved. This foreshadowed that, in carrying out the priesthood into which he was installed on earth, Jesus presented his sacrifice with heated zeal, keeping his mind on what he ■was doing according to God’s Word, with wholesome, pure thoughts. He served God with the strength of his best shoulder. For such faithfulness, “the government shall be upon his shoulder.”—Isa. 9: 6.

<p><span class="font5">Since A.D. 1918 Jehovah has not kept silence. When he was keeping silence prior to the coming of his Messenger and King to the temple in 1918, the hypocrites in Christendom were doing certain criminal things. They persuaded themselves that God’s silence meant his approval of their religious misdeeds. His breaking his silence means that he would send forth his judgment message by means of his Messenger at the temple and by means of the faithful remnant of his anointed witnesses on earth. At the time of executing his destructive judgments against the nations, at the battle of Armageddon, then God will put into play his forces of destruction like a consuming fire, and it will be very stormy about him as he expresses his wrath against the religious hypocrites.

<p><span class="font5">The pure and undefiled worshiper will wisely avoid personal, bodily companionships with those of this world. More than that, he will watch against developing any mental sympathy and fellowship with this world by privately following its ways and standards and by trying to introduce such among the company of God’s consecrated people. “Set your affection [your mind] on things above, not on things on the earth.” (Col. 3:2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> Mental conformity to this world will lead at last to conformity of conduct and also physical association with the world. The world indulges in the works of the flesh, for it does not know what God’s spirit is. Its unclean and defiling things are not part of a true worship of God in spirit and in truth.

<p><span class="font5">While Jesus was on earth he testified or bore witness to God’s kingdom, and now this work of testifying the same as he did he has left behind him for his followers to do. This makes it a partnership with Jesus Christ in giving the testimony, and this partnership is spoken of as the “testimony of Jesus Christ” or the “witness of Jesus Christ”. (Rev. 1: 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> One of those who received a special part of this work of testimonygiving or testification </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(martyrin')</span><span class="font5"> was Paul the apostle. In that manner he as well as his fellow Christians share with Jesus in the work of reconciliation of sinners to God. (2 Cor. 5:18-20) By this they have the “testimony of Jesus Christ”, that is to say, the same work of testification that Jesus Christ had. It is at God’s command that they deliver this witness which Jesus commits to them. Hence those giving the testimony must be Jehovah’s witnesses.

Hence there must come a complete and major fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prophecy above. It has come upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses at this end of the world. From and after 1919 God’s power reinstated them in their spiritual privileges and opportunities. Because of cleansing themselves from all religion and faithfully engaging in His service since then, God watches over this remnant to do them good, and that without an end. Because Jehovah of hosts has built them up and planted them in the earth as His witnesses, their enemies will fail to uproot, tear down, and destroy the remnant of faithful worshipers.

<p><span class="font5">When seated on high, Jehovah’s remnant of Zion could not look seemly with bonds of captivity about their neck. Hence the above command. In obedience, the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses no longer let themselves be led whithersoever the ruling powers of modern Babylon choose to lead them. They do not let their heads, their thoughts, be taken captive by the religion or ideas or propaganda of this world and be held down thereby to the service of this condemned and fleeting world. They no longer bow their necks under the impression that the worldly authorities who fight against God are “the higher powers”. With the freedom of the use of their heads, which the knowledge of God’s truth has brought to them, they own no other headship than that of Jehovah and his King, the Higher Powers in fact and in truth.

He thus showed he had the quality of perfect trustworthiness for the highest and most confidential office to which God could and did appoint him. And thus, too, through sufferings, Jesus qualified for the High Priesthood unto God. If the sons of God, whom He brings to heavenly glory, would obey Christ Jesus as the Captain of their salvation, they must obey or copy his example. That is, they must suffer at the enemy hands in order to prove, as did their Captain, their complete obedience to God. In no other way can they qualify to be priests with him.

It includes the training of the children in the serving of God. For this training the children must, of course, be made to know what is in God’s written Word. His Word shows the reason for such training, and a child wants to know the reason for things. If his inquiring mind is satisfied on the reason, then he will more willingly follow along, because now he is intelligent. He must, therefore, be fed on the milk of God’s Word, the same as with grown-up persons who are new and young in the truth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

As the Lutterworth Press translation of 1938 reads at John 10:8: “All who came </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">instead of me</span><span class="font5"> are thieves and robbers.” Such were the religious leaders and clergymen who were bidding for the leadership of the sheep, instead of letting Christ Jesus take possession of his own. Being the devoted Son of the Great Owner of the sheep, Christ Jesus would naturally have a sincere care and desire for the sheep’s welfare, for they represent his Father’s property and interests. His proper attention to the needs, safety and well-being of the sheep would be to the vindication of the name of his Father, Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">It would be presuming upon all nations to call upon them to praise Jehovah without first telling them why. Hence the call at Psalm 117:1 must be backed up and implemented by giving all nations the vital knowledge and understanding with which to obey the call and invitation to praise. Psalm 117 constitutes the authority from God to his spiritual Israelites to give this needed information and knowledge to those who attend to the call and obey it. The answers to questions concerning Jehovah comprise the information and knowledge all persons are entitled to have before being expected to respond and join in Jehovah’s praise. Hence there is today a world-wide need for a witness to the nations concerning Jehovah and his Messianic Government in order to let the people hear, exercise faith and believe in the Kingdom message and know the good, sound reasons for praising the Lord God.

At the final end of this consummation of the world, every last one of the “tares” will be burned out, together with the great enemy, the Devil, who sowed them. But the harvested “wheat” class and the Lord’s enfolded “other sheep” will survive that time of fiery destruction. Then the righteous “wheat” class will pass into invisible heavenly glories.

He thus set himself apart to be a clean channel or messenger by which God might send the needed truth to his disciples. He studied, prayed, prepared and set himself to preach the truth and nothing but the whole truth concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom. Jesus also furnished them a faithful example of what it means to be sanctified to God, and thus his example as well as his word helped in that direction. Because of this important, indispensable part which he plays in the work for us, and because it is of God that all this comes, it is written: “Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sanctification,</span><span class="font5"> and redemption.”—1 Cor. 1: 30.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.—Ps. 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil’s defiant boast is that he can corrupt all worship of Jehovah God. Do you agree with the Devil? No? Then stamp the Devil as a liar by keeping your worship pure, uncorrupted, unsoiled. To those who now declare among the nations that Jehovah has begun to reign by his King Christ Jesus, this command is given; “0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.” (Ps. 96: 9,10) This means worship of Jehovah without any admixture of the practices of this world. Such separateness and cleanness from the unholy world is beautiful in the sight of Him whom we worship. It also makes our worship and service to Him more impressive and effective among persons of good-will to whom we declare His kingdom. In his worship there is the purest and most enduring of pleasures and delights. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “isles” and “eoastlands”, that is to say, the peoples outside of Jehovah’s spiritual remnant, must wait for him, and not wait for what the political, commercial and religious rulers promise to set up in this postwar epoch. Since A.D. 1918 multitudes of such “isles” and “coastlands” have been hearing of Jehovah’s kingdom with Christ seated at His side. Now many are putting their trust in His power, particularly his power as manifested through his right arm, Christ Jesus. Obeying his command (Isa. 51:6), they look at the present heavens and earth from the Bible viewpoint. That is, they look at this world and see it is Satan’s organization. They see that his invisible organization of demons, now dislodged from on high, is the unclean, wicked “heavens” of this world. The visible organization among men in which politics, commerce and religion rule is the “earth”.

As it is written: “Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city [the new earth].” No wonder that they considered themselves to be “strangers and pilgrims on the earth” during this present evil world and refused to mix in with its heathenish city governments and its commerce and religion.—Heb. 11:13.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s “other sheep” of today are the faithful companions and fellow witnesses of His remnant of the “body of Christ”. (John 10:16) While they do not now enjoy the perfecting that the remnant have through a justification by the sacrifice of Christ, the “other sheep” class must be of “perfect heart” toward Jehovah God. In this respect they must be like the faithful men of old who did not receive that “better thing” which God has provided for His sons whom he brings to glory above, including today’s remnant. It is those “other sheep” keeping their heart integrity to God during this time of temptation at the end of Satan’s world that may hope to pass through the battle of Armageddon alive and to enter into the righteous New World. Thereafter the thousand-year Kingdom will bring about their complete perfecting in the paradise on earth. They will serve the heavenly King.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God.—Heb. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has ordained the needed priesthood for the New World of righteousness. “Ordain” means “to place or set down in office”; and the ordination or appointment of this priesthood is one of the guarantees that the New World which Jehovah God creates will be a righteous world, freed from all guilt of sin. The need of a priesthood has been recognized by most nations, but their priesthoods have effected nothing for men but deception, because they were not ordained of the God against whom man has done wrong, and they have not had the proper sacrifice. The kind of priest that humankind has needed is one who could go up to heaven itself, into God’s very presence, and there present a sacrifice that met perfectly all the requirements of divine justice. No human priest could do this, because God’s heaven is spiritual. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Just as the people’s sin-offering came after the one for Aaron and his household, so all believers of humankind outside of the “royal priesthood” get the benefits of Christ’s sin-offering after the members of His priesthood. Those of the priesthood get the atoning benefits now, during this period from Pentecost down to the end of this world at Armageddon, for God now justifies them to life by reason of their faith in Jesus’ blood and its worth. But the benefits of the one Sin-offering do not halt with qualifying these for the royal priesthood; the benefits therefrom are extended afterward to believers of mankind during the thousandyear reign of Christ. That means after the battle of Armageddon, which clears the way for his rule over mankind without interference. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is an interchange of confidence and trust between all those having to do with the sheepfold of the Abrahamic covenant arrangement. The Good Shepherd has confidence in his sheep, because he identifies who they are. He knows their names and takes interest in each one personally. Were one to be lost, he would notice its absence and go in search of it if there was any possibility of recovering it. Likewise, the sheep put their confidence and trust in him. They see that Jehovah has made him the one and only Head of the church. Hence they will not entrust themselves to any others who lift themselves up as leaders and commanders to the people. There is only the one Messiah and they have identified him by the proof of God’s Word. They will not stray from their Good Shepherd and follow after a selfish, worldly leader.

<p><span class="font5">The gathering means that they are assembled together to the trial and judgment which Jehovah sets in motion by his royal Judge at the temple, Christ the King. The assembling is brought about by setting His judgment-message before all those summoned and concerned, by means of His Theocratic organization for publishing his message. Hence not only is the faithful remnant gathered to the grand courtroom for the occasion, but also all those of Christendom who make loud claims of being God’s saints in covenant relationship with him by Christ’s sacrifice. Also present at the trial and judgment, as observers, would be the multitudes of persons of good-will, because surely these good-will companions are included in the sweep of heaven and earth to which God calls. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.—John 10:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In putting forth his sheep in the morning in order to lead them out to pasturelands the shepherd in the East has a general call, which is his own peculiar style of call used by no other shepherd, and which the sheep know and answer as a flock. This call each sheep knows in addition to its own individual name. In this sense they know his voice of call, and they acknowledge it by answering it in obedience. They love their shepherd. His voice inspires confidence in them, for they trust in their shepherd whom they have proved to be their faithful guardian and provider. The “voice” of call to which Jesus’ own sheep answered was not their mere individual names, as when he said to Andrew’s brother: “Thou art Simon.” The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">voice</span><span class="font5"> that the sheep know and which made them follow Jesus was the voice of preaching the Kingdom gospel.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 23:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Note that the thinking is said to be in the heart, and not, as we would now say, in the mind. This shows that our choices, our preferences and our affections go along with our thoughts which we entertain. In a spiritual or figurative way the “heart” means the seat of our affections and of our operations of the mind. The heart of a thing refers to the midst of it, as when a ship is said to be in the heart of the sea. (Prov. 23:34) Our heart refers to the midst of us or to what we actually are within ourselves. This is determined by what our preferred thoughts are or by where our love and affections lie. A hypocrite disguises what he is inside. Hence it is not for our good health to take spiritual food from a religious hypocrite. What we are outwardly, let us be that from the heart, namely, Christians faithful for God’s kingdom.

They picture the people of good-will of today who unite themselves with Jehovah’s present-day remnant of true spiritual Israelites. “And the children of Israel journeyed from Raineses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The apostle limits the hope of a change from human to spirit to those who have been begotten of God’s spirit, to become his spiritual children, and who are members of the “body of Christ”. In preparation for this change God has made these Christian believers to be “new creatures”, and hence they conduct themselves differently from the world of mankind and have a different destiny or future in view. (2 Cor. 5:17) Also, as a pledge and first installment of the spirit life for which God has wrought them, he has poured out upon them his holy spirit or active force. Only those anointed and having such a pledge or guaranty of God’s spirit have any reason to hope for a change in the resurrection.

From the very time that he organized them as a Theocratic nation and established his worship among them according to Moses’ law, the Lord God took them in charge as his chosen people and led them. He made an independent nation of them; and to do this he led them out from the house of slavery. The nations of Christendom and heathendom do not pause to consider the name that Jehovah God made for himself in that crisis of long ago. The people, together with the nations, choose to ignore his name. Therefore they will soon learn to know his name, when he again makes it glorious by the rule of the iron rod. Modern Egypt and her peoples will feel the rod, but Jehovah’s sheep will experience his salvation and become his everlasting witnesses to his glorious name.

<p><span class="font5">During the days of Christ’s twelve apostles the various miraculous gifts of the holy spirit were bestowed only in the presence of these apostles or by their laying their hands upon the heads of the baptized believers. This holy spirit, with its gifts of various kinds, acted as a force in the believers’ lives and also counteracted the spirit of this world. That is, this holy spirit which is from God and by Christ has sanctifying power. Unless the believers received this spirit and were begotten by it to a heavenly hope as God’s spiritual children, and unless it worked in their lives in opposition to the power of this world, their sanctification to God and his kingdom could not go on with success. The spirit must distinguish them as holy unto God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Perfected” has the meaning of being qualified and being introduced or inaugurated into a position of service. The perfect-hearted forefathers and forerunners of Jesus Christ, receiving life from him as King, become his sons or children. (Ps. 45:16) In order for there to be a “new earth” under the “new heavens”, he inaugurates or installs those faithful ones of old in office as earthly princes to represent the heavenly kingdom. Thereby he </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perfects</span><span class="font5"> them in office or consecrates them in princely office and so establishes the “new earth”. This, too, is an advantage over those of mankind who come forth from death to a “resurrection of judgment”. Thus the faithful ones of old who died without receiving the promise do attain a “better resurrection”. During Christ’s reign they get blessings from the Seed of Abraham through the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Referring to the new nation, spiritual Israel, the Lord God thus tells of the better promises on which the new covenant rests. With the new covenant there was promised to come an inward, heartfelt love of righteousness, and a thorough-going knowledge of the God of the covenant, and a justification from sin in his sight. This was far better than the benefits of the old law covenant, for the Mosaic law of that old covenant was carved upon hard, cold stone and also written upon manuscript scrolls; and the knowledge of Jehovah and of his law was mainly reposed with the priests and Levites as instructors. Also the animal sacrifices which such priests offered did not justify or perfect the Israelites but needed to be repeated regularly year after year.

<p><span class="font5">The true church gratefully acknowledges God’s gift through Christ to her, namely, of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. (Eph. 4:7-13) But even though she is provided with such human instruments, she looks above them to her Head, Christ Jesus, and through him to the Supreme Power, Jehovah, the Great Teacher. Thus, while recognizing the authority of the Bible and while recognizing it as the one authoritative Book, she at the same time recognizes and abides by the supreme authority of Jehovah God. She recognizes also the representative authority of Christ Jesus, the Chief Servant of God. She knows God is the One that makes the Bible authoritative; and hence she looks to Him as the Infallible Interpreter of the Bible, of which He is the Author.

Of course not, for all its propaganda belittles and reproaches Jehovah God and shoves him into the background while exalting and pushing into the eye-filling forefront the mighty ones and imposing organizations of this world.

<p><span class="font5">By his own sacrifice Jesus fulfilled the type of the Jewish sacrifices. Thereafter on the day of Pentecost of A.D. 33 he offered up the antitypical oblation or offering to God by pouring out the holy spirit upon his disciples on earth. He caused the Jewish sacrifice and oblation to cease or desist from having typical value or any recognition with God. God now accepted the realities. The midst or middle of the seventieth week was marked by the cutting off of Messiah in death, displacing the Jewish sacrifice and oblation according to Mosaic law. During all that week the Abra-hamic covenant continued confirmed to the Jewish remnant that accepted Jesus as “Messiah the Prince”. The anointing with the spirit during that week and to its end continued solely upon consecrated Jewish flesh. At the end of that week A.D. 36 the anointing was free to go to believing Gentiles. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

Thus the quarry or “hole of the pit” out of which the Christian remnant were dug is the womb of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ivoman</span><span class="font5"> or heavenly universal organization Zion, the antitypical Sarah. She is the organization that brought forth Christ Jesus as the antitypical Isaac, and she is the one that has brought forth the remnant of Christ’s body since A.D. 1918.

<p><span class="font5">While the term </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">consecration</span><span class="font5"> is not mentioned in the record, the profession of believing in Jesus would have been hypocritical and in vain if they had not consecrated to God through Christ, to do the divine will henceforth. If this was not so, God, who reads men's hearts, would not have poured out his holy spirit upon them to do His holy will. Believing, in a true sense, means consecration to God, and not a mere mental agreement with the facts about God and Christ. (Rom. 10: 9,10) James 2: 26 says: “Faith without works is dead also.” Hence acting on one’s belief and carrying out one’s consecration to God means being a witness concerning God, his purpose and his works by Christ.

These are not delegated to do such work, but are merely His witnesses, and not judges and executioners of the tares. At the coming of the Harvester, Christ Jesus, to the temple he is attended by a host of heavenly angels. These he sends forth to pull out the tares from among the wheat class. (Matt. 25:31) These unseen heavenly angels will make no mistakes as to whom to pull out. The tares that they jerk out are the religionists who both stumble over Christ Jesus as the new reigning King and who seek to put stumblingblocks in the way of faithful Christians to make them stumble into everlasting destruction.

Hence applying the blood to Aaron’s right organs of hearing, manual work and walking says that Jesus heard God’s Word, which prophetically told of his sacrifice, and he heeded what was written concerning him in the volume of God’s Book; he used his hands or applied his physical powers to fulfilling God’s Word which he heard telling of his sacrificial duties as High Priest; and, thirdly, he walked in the pathway of sacrifice, straight up to God’s altar, without turning to the right hand or to the left. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font5"> ear, thumb and great toe being blood-marked, it pictured that he heard, did and walked to the best of his physical powers.

There must be no longing for the things left behind. “Remember Lot’s wife,” who, having escaped from doomed Sodom, was soon afterward destroyed for disregarding the divine command not to look back. We who worship Jehovah have all come out of this Babylonish world. We dare not now try to carry our former unclean, worldly practices over into God’s organization of his people. The two things do not mix and have no agreement. He is jealous, now, for the cleanness and purity of his organization of the remnant and their good-will companions. Therefore anyone trying to defile it and corrupt it from within will not be let remain but will in due process of time be put out by God’s execution of judgment. —Isa. 4:2-4. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Before being baptized and anointed with the spirit Jesus could not present himself at the sheepfold as the Good Shepherd, because he must be the Messiah or Anointed when so doing. Anyone not such who tried to take over the charge of God’s “sheep” in line for the heavenly kingdom would be just a thief and robber. He would not try to get in by the rightful way, namely, by the door through meeting God’s qualifications as the anointed Shepherd. Such selfish one would be a false Messiah, a false Christ. Jesus was born as the Son of God and in the tribe of Judah according to the flesh. Having devoted himself to God and been baptized and then anointed with God’s spirit and proclaimed to be the Son in whom God is well pleased, he could without questioning or interference enter in through the door into the sheepfold. John at once stepped aside and let Jesus have the sheep. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Moses anointed the high priest Aaron, but not his four sons. This agrees with the fact that Jesus is he whom God anointed directly, and hence he was the first one to receive the anointing of God’s spirit. This requires that his followers, who are made his underpriests, should receive the anointing of God’s holy spirit through Christ Jesus. When telling his disciples of his going away, Jesus assured them that it was in their interest that he went to heaven to his Father, for otherwise they would not get the holy spirit as a comforter or helper; but if he did go to heaven, then he would send this comforting spirit to them, even the spirit of truth. (John 14:16,17; 15:26; 16:7,13) This spirit of anointing proceeds from God the Holy One as its Source.—1 John 2:20. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

The consecrated bodies of the remnant, who are part of the temple in which God’s spirit dwells, are also likened to vessels for use in His service. The carrying forth of these vessels to God’s name and honor demands a clean-cut separation of his consecrated witnesses from this world, modern Babylon. To touch its unclean things by taking part with this world in its schemes and activities for a United Nations organization and a better and finer world created by men’s hands means to defile ourselves. It unfits us for serving and worshiping God at his temple with his holy vessels. We must keep ourselves pure and unspotted from this world down till its destruction at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">The present state of the sanctified Christians is not, therefore, one of actual perfection in their flesh or physical bodies. But by faith in Christ’s sacrifice Christians have a righteous standing or justification with God and are counted perfect through Jesus’ righteousness imputed to them. Hence they may draw near to God with no consciousness of sin-guilt, their hearts being sprinkled with his cleansing blood. (Ileb. 10:19-22) These, therefore, are the perfected </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span><span class="font5"> ones whom the apostle speaks of as “the spirits of just men made perfect”. (Heb. 12: 23) These justified ones walk after the spirit of God and not after the flesh. The spirit is more pronounced and noteworthy about them than their imperfect flesh, the sins of which are perfectly cleansed away by Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">The man of understanding feasts on things that this foolish, afflicted postwar world cannot know, grasp or digest. He wisely feeds upon the knowledge of God’s truth and is happy and joyful. But the prodigal-son class is sure to come to misery. The only way for them to escape from the deadly affliction of the spiritual famine is to come to their senses and seek knowledge from the heavenly Father and come home to his Theocratic organization. Only those in that organization have understanding hearts, and these are having a feast of gladness continually despite the famine that afflicts religious Christendom.

<p><span class="font5">Having accomplished a sanctification from sins for the believers which lasts for good, Christ Jesus did not need to stay down here on earth in the flesh in order to repeat his sacrifice, but he could ascend up to heaven and present the value of his human sacrifice up there. Further, since his sacrificing once brings about perfect justification from sin to believers who consecrate to God, it was not necessary for Jesus to come down repeatedly from heaven during all the past nineteen centuries in order to offer himself in sacrifice again and again, as is claimed in the Roman Catholic “sacrifice of the mass”, so called. Jesus could stay seated up in heaven at his Father’s right hand and wait till his Father’s due time to put Christ’s enemies under his royal footstool. (Heb. 10:12,13) The due time arrived A.D. 1914.

<p><span class="font5">Beginning the trial, Jehovah is first to testify, laying his charges against those who profess to be his people, his Israel, but either they are not such or they are not correctly carrying out the terms of the covenant by sacrifice. So God describes the formalities of offering outward sacrifice without one’s heart being in it in true worship of God. God is not pleased but is nauseated at such formal worship by those who do not live up to the covenant. It brings much reproach upon God’s name. How, then, can he recognize their religious formalities? Do these things enrich him at all? Do Christendom’s money drives for magnificent cathedrals and religious institutions and functions contribute anything to God’s wealth and obligate him morally to them?

<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ being plunged by John beneath the waters of the Jordan river signified his death to his own personal will. John’s lifting him up out of the waters signified Jesus’ arising as a new creature to do henceforth the particular and exclusive will of God for him in connection with the Kingdom. That Jesus made a consecration on this occasion was foretold at Psalm 40: 6-8 and witnessed to by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 10:4-7. Thus Jesus’ consecration was his solemn presentation of himself to do God’s will, as that will was written beforehand in God’s Word, the Bible. God’s pouring out his spirit upon Jesus, accompanied by the visible manifestation of a dove, together with God’s voice saying from heaven, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,” this was Jehovah God’s consecration of his Son Jesus there at the Jordan river.

<p><span class="font5">The enthronement of Christ Jesus, the Son of David, in the heavenly kingdom is a mercy from God toward mankind. Hence the call upon all nations and peoples to praise Jehovah for his mercy and loving-kindness has its strongest application from and after 1914, the date of the Kingdom’s establishment. When we see that the Kingdom is set up over the degenerate race of Adam and Eve, we can appreciate what a mercy this kingdom is. God would have been within his right to destroy the sinners inside the garden of Eden and to create a new human pair in perfection to start a righteous race. In that ease </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font5"> would have been no part of that perfect race. But, instead of resorting to such measures, Jehovah God, for the vindication of his sovereignty and name, chose to set up in mercy a Government of liberation over sinful mankind.

<p><span class="font5">That everlasting gospel is therefore the one that must now be preached. By it the loud command is given to give glory to God and to worship God the Creator. The One to whom the gospel is due and who produced it and sent it forth by Jesus Christ is Jehovah God. In no way does the gospel give less honor and praise to Him than it does to Christ Jesus. Hence Mark calls attention to the fact that “Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God”. (Mark 1:14, A.S.P.) The kingdom of God is the main theme of the gospel that Jesus preached. Also Paul many times speaks of it as the “gospel of God”, also as the “gospel of the grace of God”, and as the “glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust”.

This “change” is something not possible for man to accomplish, even with modern science. No sane man could properly hope to experience such a change except it were promised to him by Almighty God Jehovah. Only he could effect such a miraculous changing of creatures who were of flesh and blood to become immortal spirit creatures able to appear in God’s heavenly presence and to gaze upon him and live. He has promised such a change to certain ones who gain his special favor. This promised “change” was long a mystery or sacred secret. It was not unlocked and disclosed until the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In fact, he was the first one to undergo this change from flesh to spirit.—1 Pet. 3 :18,19.

That nation represents a new government, whose rule will reach to the ends of this earth to bestow upon all its willing subjects the blessings of enduring peace, freedom, health and life. The new covenant which produces the people for this government of blessings has been in operation for more than nineteen centuries. Soon it will have served its purpose in producing the complete membership of this governmental body. Though the time of duration of the covenant has been so long, yet the membership of the new nation and its government is comparatively small.

They have received justification from God because of the imputation of the perfect righteousness of Christ to them, and hence they know His righteousness. In keeping with the new covenant by which God has taken them out of the world to be a “people for his name” they have the divine law written on their hearts by His holy spirit. Therefore, to encourage their continued faithfulness and integrity in this postwar era he now bids them to hearken to him and not fear the reproaches and revilings which are in store for them. The Lord’s “other sheep”, who companion with His remnant, also need to hearken to his word of warning. Fearless of what man may say or do, they must continue to seek Jehovah’s side of the paramount issue and set their hearts on his law and be subject always to his sovereignty.

<p><span class="font5">Since it is through suffering that Christ Jesus was made perfect, he was not thus perfect at the time he was baptized in water and anointed with God’s spirit at the Jordan river, for his sufferings came afterward. The sufferings added nothing to Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, which was perfect in itself. But they added something to Jesus as God’s anointed High Priest. What? A proved obedience or proved faithfulness and integrity that answered all the false charges that all the enemies of Jehovah God could hurl against his High Priest. This proved obedience showed Jesus to be perfectly reliable and dependable to be entrusted with the High Priest’s office. Hence it showed him to be perfectly qualified or suitable to be God’s Chief Servant and Vindicator.—Heb. 5: 5-10. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

He takes it that when he hired himself out he did not agree to undertake such risks. At the sign of danger to himself, he compromises with the bloodthirsty, wolfish powers of the world. He is not unselfish and courageous enough to stand his ground and resist them with God’s spiritual armor and weapons and to take the lead of the sheep in worshiping and serving Jehovah and feeding upon his truth and service. Without protest the quailing, fleeing hireling surrenders up the Lord’s sheep to the beastly despoilers and scatterers of the organized flock of sheep.

<p><span class="font5">Garments are what serves to identify or distinguish an official servant or honored servant. In this picture the garments distinguished the high priest and his corps of underpriests. Sprinkling, then, blood and oil upon the officially clothed priests was a way of telling us in advance that Christ Jesus and his anointed followers would be identified by the blood of the ransom sacrifice and by the spirit of God. Their service to Him would be connected with the blood and the spirit and would be distinguished by these. The blood of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice and the spirit which comes from God through him are two vital factors in installing Christ’s followers as underpriests, members of his “royal priesthood”.

The bundling of the tares does not picture their being tied up into hundreds of sects and religious cults. The binding of them in bundles occurs after the harvest starts and particularly from and after 1919. It pictures the restraints that the great Harvester puts upon the tares by the use of angels. Like the gatekeepers at the gates of the Lord’s temple in Jerusalem, the angels, keeping always on the watch, see to it that such tares do not get back into the field among the wheat to mix themselves with the “children of the kingdom”.

Be one Jew and another Greek-speaking Gentile, be one slave and another freeman, be one male and another female, all, yes, one and all, are required to exercise the one and the same faith in Christ. All are required to follow his one example and to give their allegiance to him as their one Head and Leader. All are obliged to co-operate and serve together as one corporate body under him. Race, economic status, and sex make no exceptions to this one rule. However, that transcendent fact does not wipe out our fleshly-earthly conditions in which we were when becoming members of Christ’s one indivisible body.

It resulted in a world-wide witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom such as earth has never known till now. This argues that the new covenant has been inaugurated in a final and complete sense by Christ at the temple, because we have reached the “mountain” of God’s established kingdom. (Heb. 12:18-29) In keeping with the better promises of the new covenant Jehovah has shown, in a most manifest way before all the worldly nations, that this remnant of witnesses are his people.

<p><span class="font5">Today it is common knowledge that the nations are girding themselves, binding themselves into a world union for strength. In foretelling this, Jehovah God twice mentions them as girding, and with the same result to each girding. This seems to foretell two efforts at world union by all the nations and countries. Remarkably, we are now living at the time when the second girding has been effected. Before the year 1945 was out the Charter was adopted by the needed members and majority of nations, and the organization of the United Nations came into existence and began to get organized and take form.

For this they must, of course, be well-informed themselves, and so should study for the sake of fulfilling this duty to their young. They must be not merely material breadwinners and physical caretakers over their own, but must also be spiritual providers. This spiritual provision begins first in the home, and the children should be made to expect it of the parents. In so doing the parents are laying up a better future for their children, that is, a future with a prospect of everlasting life in the new world of uprightness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At this period of human history Jehovah God stands bound by his own word to prove he is true. He will give the proof without fail. Seeing such a certainty, it is wise for men to now give the truth to Him. The unchangeable truth of this God is to be found in the Bible. He takes the responsibility for the Bible and prominently associates his name with it. Although it was written by men who acted as his servants, he was its Author, for he inspired and dictated and guided the writing of it. Throughout the pages of that God-inspired Book its writers declare His truthfulness. Their declarations stand as challenges to men who question the truth of God and of his written Word, the Bible. They stand as guarantees to us that the Bible is the standard by which the truth is to be measured. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The uncircumcised who are never again, as in 1918, to trample down the organization and render it inactive in God’s work are the Babylonish worldlings of Christendom. The unclean who are no more to have any part with such uncircumcised ones in thus crippling Jehovah’s organization of servants are the Judas class, who professed consecration to God but who turned traitor and became an “evil servant” class and co-operated with the unclean world in its attacks on God’s remnant. They acted the part of the Edomites of old, Esau’s descendants. Esau, although circumcised, showed himself profane and unclean toward God by despising the birthright which God made with Abraham. Jehovah’s promise above means that such uncireum-cised assailants, with the unclean “evil servant” class conniving, will never again break down the unity, organization and faithful activity of His witnesses.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works.—Heb. 9:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “blood of Christ” signifies the value of his perfect human life. It is this that washes away the guilt of sin of the person believing in him. Hence it really sanctifies to the purifying of the believer’s flesh. Hence, too, God justifies such believer from his sins and gives him a clean standing in the flesh. God thereby makes him suitable to be sacrificed with Jesus Christ as one of his underpriests. As it is written to such ones: “Being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.” (Rom. 5:9) Before this they had a conscience or consciousness of committing “dead works” or the works of those condemned to death. But now, through Christ’s blood, they were justified from sin and were sanctified or set apart for the service of the living God.

<p><span class="font5">Animal sacrifices could not take away the sins of mankind who had once been given dominion over such animals. Moreover, the Levitic priests of Israel by offering such animal sacrifices could only get into the symbolic presence of Jehovah God as represented by the sacred ark in the Most Holy of the tabernacle. If the Messiah or coming Priest after Mclchizedek’s order was to be better than the Levitic priesthood, then he must have a better sacrifice, a sin-removing sacrifice, and he must be able to get into God’s actual presence in the heavens in order to offer the value of this better sacrifice. What Jews and all should look for now is the everlasting Priest whom Jehovah’s sworn oath has made after the order of Melchizedek and higher than the Levitic priesthood and having a better temple than a material one over in Jerusalem. That One greater than Aaron and David is the promised Messiah or Anointed, Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the battle of Armageddon God will tear wicked, hypocritical Christendom to pieces by his “Lion of the tribe of Juda”, Christ Jesus his Executioner, and will blot out her religion. Those, however, who will see God’s deliverance and salvation to eternal life in the New World will be those who now set their way or life-course according to their covenant obligations. These avoid all forms of wickedness and hypocritical religious formalities. They remember their Creator God continually. They use their all to glorify him by daily sacrificing to him the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, declaring his holy name and his glorious kingdom by Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">In world events since A.D. 1914 we have the factual proof that Jehovah’s truth has endured over these nineteen centuries from when the writing of the Bible was finished. There will be further fulfillment of the truth of God’s word in years to come down till Armageddon is fought and the new world of righteous new heavens and earth is fully ushered in. Such foreverenduring truth is something transcendent, over which all truth-lovers can call all nations to praise and worship him. In the supreme test of truth and error Jehovah’s truth will win and Satan’s error and his entire system of error will go down into destruction. Meanwhile, during the present-day thick of the fight, we have a part in proving God true and the Devil false by holding fast our position on Jehovah’s side and there keeping our integrity.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since Jesus was not of the priestly tribe of Levi, he did not consecrate himself to God to offer up animal sacrifices on the temple altar at Jerusalem. He offered up his human body, which God had miraculously prepared for him, as a ransom sacrifice for human sins; and on earth Jesus used that body faithfully in God’s work for a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Do believers not follow his example also in making a consecration to God? We may make a search of the so-called “New Testament”, and yet we will not find the invitation, in just such words, to “make a personal consecration to God” or to “consecrate yourself to God”. And yet the invitation to do this is there. To quote Jesus’ words: “Whoever will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his yoke, and come with me.”—Matt. 16: 24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Torrey.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.—Dan. 9:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The covenant confirmed or made strong is the Abra-hamic covenant regarding the seed for blessing all families of the earth. Confirming it or making strong its application to “many” means limiting first its benefits to the Jews exclusively during this “one week”. The one that confirms it is Jehovah’s Judge, Christ Jesus, who executes the divine judgment upon rebellious Jerusalem. During his preaching ministry he confined himself strictly to the circumcised Jews and instructed his evangelists to copy his example. (Rom. 15: 8) Even after he as Messiah was cut off, the Abra-hamic covenant privileges could not at once be extended to Gentile believers. First there must be one week’s confirmation of the covenant to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">many</span><span class="font5"> Jewish believers, down to the fall of A.D. 36. Hence Peter could not be sent to Cornelius the Gentile till the fall of 36, when the “one week” ended. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus said also: “The hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28,29, A.jS.F.) Abraham and other faithful ones of old went down into death with a “perfect heart” toward God, and they will come up out of the graves with such when the Judge Christ Jesus shortly utters his voice of command. They being the first of the earthly inhabitants of the new world to be raised from death, they will have an advantage over those who will later be raised from the tombs to “the resurrection of judgment”. Also they will be raised in the way of life, being in line for life eternal under God’s kingdom. In this way they have a “better resurrection” than evildoers.

We can no more stop the pursuit of us by these persecutors than the Israelites could halt the Egyptian hordes at their heels. But despite all the bread of affliction we eat we are free of antitypical Egypt; we are Jehovah’s freedmen by Christ Jesus. Under their leadership and protection, we celebrate the feast of holy freedom as we march forward to the New World of righteousness, singing their high praises and calling upon all the nations to be glad with us and to join us in the march. The Red sea of Armageddon just ahead will not stop us. It </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will </span><span class="font5">stop our persecuting pursuers dead in their tracks, not so much as one of them remaining.

<p><span class="font5">The sheep enter into the fold for safety. They have not only the surrounding enclosure as a protection but also the presence of their shepherd at the most vital spot, the doorway. Overhead and all about them they have the invisible guardianship of the divine Shepherd Jehovah God, whom the shepherd represents. In two respects Christ Jesus is the “door”. No one can enter into the Kingdom inheritance of the Abrahamic covenant except through Him as the true Seed of Abraham. (John 14:6) Only in his name and by union with him as his consecrated faithful follower and spiritual brother can anyone enter into the Kingdom privileges, both those on earth and those in heaven. He is also the door in that he is the faithful Exemplar, and only by copying him and being conformed to his image of faithfulness under suffering even to the death can anyone get into the Kingdom blessings and privileges of the Abrahamic covenant.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 5:9, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This should be the life purpose of Christians who have faith in the things unseen. When clothed upon with the “building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens”, the resurrected Christians will be able to please the Lord perfectly. But there is comfort in the thought that, even now on earth while at home in the body and absent from their Lord and Head, the Christians can please him, that is, if they make it their purpose to do so. So doing, they will not weakly seek to please men of the world nor to conform themselves to this selfish world which their Lord will shortly dash to fragments at the oncoming battle of Armageddon. Their steadfast aim will be to copy the example of the apostles who said: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Everywhere we hear the people of Christendom speaking in favor of the postwar conspiracy, this League of Nations creature that has now come up out of the bottomless pit into which it was shoved by World War II. There is no common ground between this modern Assyrian world power and the kingdom of Jehovah’s covenant with his Christ. His witnesses will not fear it and advocate for it. Under no compulsion will they join in with the people in saying, “A conspiracy.” They declare straightforwardly in favor of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by his Heir of the Kingdom covenant. Jehovah of hosts is their fear, and not men and devils. He is the One whom they sanctify in their hearts and minds as the One to dread. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Only by having such a mind, renewed or renovated by knowledge and understanding of God’s Word, can we be effective witnesses for Him. Only then can we make the proper impression upon the honest-hearted people who have found religion to be wanting, unsatisfying. In preparing ourselves to preach and to proclaim God’s message of comfort to all nations, we must consult His Book of truth and must make it our purpose to give only His Word, His message, His answer to all the perplexing questions of these feverish times. “The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord.” (Prov. 16: 1) As those who want to preach nothing but the truth, we would have it no other way than this proverb says.

<p><span class="font5">If such was to be the example, then all the rest of the Christian congregation were to follow the same rule of conduct and be pure. All the apostles recognized the sex difference. Hence they encouraged all Christians to the greatest purity between the sexes within the church. To Timothy, who was a young unmarried overseer in the church, the apostolic instruction is given : “Rebuke not an elder [man], but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren: the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in all purity.’<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font5">(1 Tim. 5:1, 2, A.S.V.) Many are the temptations of a young single man in a responsible position.

<p><span class="font5">The remnant’s mother is God’s woman, his universal organization: “Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” Hence Rachel represents this mother, particularly as she grieved when Jehovah’s consecrated servants and witnesses were dragged off into Babylonian captivity during World War I because of fear of men and because of yielding to them as supposed “higher powers”. Now the antitypical Rachel refrains her voice from weeping and stops her tears, because her foretold comforting future has arrived and her labor is having its reward. Her children, the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, together with their goodwill companions, now recognize Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as “The Higher Powers” and are now come back from Babylon’s power and control. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Because this was the day for ordaining Aaron and his sons, and not the national day of atonement for Israel’s sin, Moses did not take the bullock’s blood into the Most Holy and sprinkle it before God’s mercy-seat there. He poured it, instead, at the altar’s base as well as smearing some of it upon the altar’s horns. The altar pictured God’s arrangement for acceptable sacrifice. The blood applied to it testified that the power of God’s true altar or sacrificial arrangement rests upon and finds its strength in the blood of his High Priest, Christ Jesus. By his ransom blood his underpriests have their sins washed away and are justified to life. This they must have before they can be fully ordained for the priesthood.

If we want to make a personal decision for Jehovah’s side of the issue and to stick on that right side, then we must resolve to endure all that such decision means now. To help us, we have a faithful example in the new world’s King, Christ Jesus. “Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.” (Rom. 15: 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Hence if we know what is the side of righteousness and wish to please God and have his comfort, we must be willing to undergo patiently all the reproaches and reviling that Satan’s world heaped upon Jehovah and his Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

In expression of his universal sovereignty he seated Christ Jesus as his reigning King-Consort. All the signs of the coming of Jehovah’s King into power in the Kingdom began in 1914, the signs beginning with World War I. The rage of the nations at Jehovah’s Theocratic reign thus begun was vented in assaulting and taking captive his devoted people on earth, which act was, therefore, no proof that Jehovah had not taken his universal power to reign over this earth. But, if any doubt existed on the matter, the salvation of his servants out of Babylon’s tight grip from and after 1919 proved beyond question that Zion’s God had become King and had begun to reign by his Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">The reason why Paul introduced the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">martyres </span><span class="font5">or witnesses here is this: that in the preceding chapter he tells us, at verses 2,4,5,39, that the faithful ones of old time had gotten witness from Jehovah God that they had his approval and that he was their God. So, instead of being living witnesses today of our racecourse, they had been in ancient times God’s witnesses, Jehovah’s witnesses, with attestations of his approval. He had disclosed himself to them as the true God and now they had to disclose him to others by the testimony of their lives. If they endured such faith-testing trials and hardships in order to get witness from Jehovah of his approval and to be His witnesses, then what ought we Christians to do? With such a cloud or crowd of Jehovah’s witnesses about us as examples of faith and loyalty, we should lay off hindrances and exercise all patient endurance to gain divine approval as those of old gained it.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus the Son of God ascended to heaven and into God’s presence and made a complete presentation of his sacrifice as High Priest. He did so after having suffered reproaches and pain even unto death in proof of his absolute, flawless obedience to God. With this qualification Christ Jesus was made perfect as God’s High Priest by being raised from the dead, not in the flesh, which he had laid down as a sacrifice, but in the spirit, as a complete spirit “new creature”. (1 Pet. 3:18, A.S.V.) Thus his perfecting really meant his being introduced into his High Priesthood in the heavens in God’s very presence. He reached the final point or pinnacle of office, by sitting down at God’s right hand as next to God. This was the final act of consecrating Jesus to this lofty office of High Priest. It was at one and the same time a perfecting and a consecrating of him for all time. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

(Rom. 6: 22, 23) Men of good-will today, who hope for life eternal on earth, are not of the sanctified ones or “saints”, who are set apart for the kingdom of heaven. However, to show good-will to God and to have His good-will to them, they must set themselves apart to God through their King Christ Jesus. They must separate themselves from this world and give themselves in allegiance to God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. To do so, they need to study God’s sanctifying Word of truth, have faith in it, live it, and proclaim it to others. Besides God’s cleansing Word, they should ask Him for his spirit to fill them.

Claiming to be in covenant with God, they still seek this world’s respect and keep on friendly terms with it, and their being a part of this world makes them spiritual adulterers. They speak double-talk in order to deceive the simple-minded and to hide their selfish, worldly aims and desires. They sit in conferences and hatch up falsehoods. Then they wrongfully accuse Jehovah’s witnesses and misrepresent them so as to keep men from hearing and heeding Jehovah’s message by his witnesses.

<p><span class="font5">Since the Good Shepherd laid down his life for all other sheep besides those of the Kingdom fold, the “other sheep” include more than the persons of goodwill who are gathered into the “one flock” of the one shepherd before Armageddon. The “other sheep” class includes all obedient ones of humankind whom he gathers into the universal flock of God. This applies, therefore, to the faithful ones of old times before Christ whose exploits of faith are described at Hebrews, chapter eleven, and who therefore merit a “better resurrection”. Upon their being raised to life on earth under God’s kingdom the Good Shepherd will send them his instructions and they will hear his voice and be gathered into his “one flock”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 13:24,38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the parable Jesus refers to the visible organization of God’s “good seed” as “the kingdom of heaven”, or “kingdom of God”. It is like a kingdom because the members of this visible organization all look up to and give allegiance to Jehovah as the “King of eternity”, the rightful sovereign of the universe. So in the great paramount issue between Jehovah and the Devil concerning the universal sovereignty, they uphold Jehovah’s side of the issue. Being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font5"> seed, they must bring forth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font5"> fruit, according to the rule that Jesus emphasized, at Matthew 7:18-21. The “good seed” do the good will of the heavenly Father. All the earth is Christ’s field of opportunity for sowing or stationing and planting the “good seed”. By his disciples he continued to sow good seed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

(2 Cor. 5:10) The separating out of the “sheep” class from among such nations is now in progress. These “sheep” out of all nations rejoice and are glad with Jehovah’s people because the Kingdom has been set up. They do good to the remnant of Christ’s brethren yet in their midst. These “sheep” forsake the side of this world and take their stand for the promised new world of righteousness, and they too seek to please their Lord and King. They do so even though they cannot see him with the eye of flesh at the temple, because they “walk by faith, not by sight”. (2 Cor. 5:7) Their burning desire is to please him, hoping to hear his words quoted above. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

When God opened the doors again, it was eight persons all consecrated to Him that came forth. Only His consecrated servants survived to reach the postdiluvian world. In like manner those who now seek to escape God’s wrath against this doomed world of violence must be baptized unto Christ Jesus, the Greater Noah. That is, they must consecrate themselves to God and must seek approach to him through Christ Jesus; they must place themselves under the Theocratic organization which is subject to Christ.

Eating leavened bread during the ancient festival was punished by the eater’s being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cut off;</span><span class="font5"> and so those of God’s organization must avoid defilement by the symbolical leaven.

Let the parents give the child some practical demonstrations of how the work is actually done in the field and how one meets with various experiences, rough and pleasant, by taking it along to the work in the field. Then, when the parent is on the road, walking by the way from house to house in publishing the Kingdom message, with his child by his side he can teach him God’s words both by direct address and by letting him listen in on the witnessing that the parent gives to persons at the door. The purpose is to fulfill God’s will, to have the child get parental training in serving its Creator. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

They do not view any of themselves as their teachers and then follow such. They are children of Zion, God’s Theocratic organization; and they rely upon his promise to her. They may have eaten the bread of adversity and drunk the water of affliction, but they prize Jehovah’s teaching as better than material things and earthly comforts, and they recognize Him as their Teacher by Christ Jesus. “Yet will thy Teacher not hide himself any more, but thine eyes shall ever be looking on thy Teacher.” (Isa. 30:20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> By his written Word and by his out-poured spirit Jehovah teaches them.

(Ps. 34:12-14) To effectively bridle the tongue or mouth, one must begin with the heart or mind, for it expresses itself through the mouth. The heart or mind must be filled with the truth from God’s Word, to the point of abundance, and then the mouth will overflow from the heart abundance and the lips will not speak the guile and hypocrisy of religion, which is of this world.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has taken the bitter cup of his wrath and displeasure out of the hands of his witnesses and has now put it into the hands of the political, commercial and religious powers of this world. Like Jeremiah, Jehovah’s witnesses now declare God’s infallible Word and notify the nations they must drink the full cup, dregs and all, of the furious wrath of the Most High God at the battle of Armageddon. (Jeremiah, chapter 25) Even such a declaration of His message of judgment against them is now a bitter, staggering cup for the worldly powers of persecution to drink. But the continued declaration by Jehovah’s witnesses of the day of his vengeance compels those worldly powers to drink it. Not flinching before the certainty of future persecutions, Jehovah’s people keep on rejoicing in his vindication and salvation. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

Because these religious, political and commercial and military leaders of hers speak not according to God’s Word. They speak contrary to His law and testimony which apply to this day of decision. They speak according to the traditions of the dead fathers of the past, and also speak according to the “doctrines of demons” in these latter times. (1 Tim. 4:1) And many even consult spirit-mediums and inquire of the demons who lyingly pretend to be the shades of the dead humans.

Caesar and his pagan empire were an abomination in God’s sight, particularly so now when chosen for king of the Jews as instead of Messiah the Prince. To the end of the seventy weeks the Jewish religionists persisted in opposing his anointed followers. And such religious leaders served at Jerusalem’s temple despite their being guilty of such an abomination. Such abomination, their alliance with Caesar against Messiah, brought upon them and their city and nation terrific desolation. The agent used to bring desolation was Rome’s political-military machine. The desolation came at God’s determined or decreed time.

He provided that they should be made partners with Jesus Christ, the true Seed of Abraham; and that, having themselves received the first blessings of God’s Abrahamic promise, they should be united with Christ Jesus in pouring out the blessings upon others. They are given the privilege of being priests with Jesus the High Priest in the heavenly kingdom and of reigning with him for the thousand years to uplift humanity.

Their deliverance from sin and death will not be due to any but the true and living God, who accepts the atoning work of his Royal High Priest, Christ Jesus.

He shows his superior power and might and establishes his right to the universal sovereignty or domination of all the universe. Thus the centuries-old fight between truth and error has in reality been a fight for universal sovereignty, and hence a fight to vindicate the true and rightful Universal Sovereign, Jehovah, with whom alone is found the truth. All his good word of promise and prophecy is involved. The fight is not yet over, but its outcome shortly will prove Satan a liar and that God is true.

This news, of all news, has to do with the paramount issue of this day and which must be settled conclusively in this atomic age, namely, Who is the Supreme Sovereign, the Life-giver, the Deliverer, and hence the true and only God Almighty?

<p><span class="font5">To undertake the course of consecration to God Jesus was inviting the men whom he chose for apostles, when he said to them: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Or, simply: “Follow me.” (Matt. 4:19; 9:9) Or, to the man with a father to bury: “Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.” (Matt. 8: 21, 22) Notice that Jesus did not say, in just those words: “Consecrate yourself to God; make a full personal consecration to God.” That was unnecessary, for the Leader was going a consecrated way, and hence the follower must likewise go in the same consecrated way, first denying himself and then casting in his lot with Jesus, to share the work-yoke and to bear a stake of reproach like that of Jesus. He must bear this stake with faithfulness to God that he might thereby vindicate God’s name and not bring reproach upon it by any unfaithfulness to escape suffering.

No true Christian’s heart is in this world and its way, and his heart will not pulsate and beat at one with the pulse of this postwar world. But to safely guard the heart and mind against the infiltration of postwar worldliness it takes knowledge. The knowledge of the truth in a heart fully devoted to God is the defense for our wellsprings of life eternal. His Word, hidden or stored up within us, is a strength to us against sinning rebelliously against him while we are under great pressure or inducement from the world and its mighty princes or governing powers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With such words the apostle shows the difference between the destiny of the unbelievers and the destiny of the believers now sanctified by God’s spirit. By pouring out the spirit upon those whom he accepts and calls to the heavenly kingdom God shows that he has chosen them and set them aside as his Kingdom heirs with Christ Jesus. Such destiny had its beginning in their believing the truth. Those who do not believe the truth are condemned, and therefore God lets a big delusion overtake them in this day. If we do not hold off from what is unclean, false and evil, the sanctifying power of God by his Word and spirit will not continue in our lives and we shall come short of complete sanctification to the successful end.

Within themselves they were greatly disturbed and hence they sought rest from God. He showed grace and favor to them in this wilderness of separation from His organization and its service. He showed them the way by which to return to him and find rest for heart and mind. A faithful remnant then returned. Thus Jehovah appeared with favor to them. He did so because from old time, from the time that Jesus began leading the spiritual Israel of God, Jehovah has loved them, since they are his consecrated witnesses.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus always kept God’s kingdom to the fore. He died as a martyr for giving unflinching testimony to it. The Kingdom covenant is therefore evidently pictured by the ephod’s forepart. The breastplate of judgment, or judicial pouch, was studded with twelve jewels bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and inside it were the sacred lots of Urim and Thum-mim. By it the Levitic high priest consulted the Lord God and determined the divine will in difficult cases and rendered judicial decisions. Since this judicial breastplate was attached to the ephod’s forepart and was worn over the high priest’s heart, it calls notice to the faet that Jehovah’s King, the Seed of Abraham, acts as Judge for Jehovah. He directly consults Jehovah to give the lights of perfection regarding God’s Word and will. During the 1000-year judgment day he will judge humankind.

He will deliver them from the snares of this world and from its destruction by His executioner at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">By thus quoting from the prophecy Jesus proves that also Isaiah was against religious traditions because they transgressed and made null and void God’s commandments. If tradition and His Word were of the same divine Source, they would agree. If they do not, then one must be of God and the other be of his adversary. Since Jesus declared the traditions contradicted God’s commandments and were a subterfuge to get around God’s law, the traditions are proved to be of God’s adversary, the Devil, using religious leaders. If Jesus warned against the method of oral tradition, he would not use such a method with the church of which God has made him the Head.

In this judgment period of determining the destiny of men and of nations this call is the principal call to the nations. It is principal in that it is a call to unselfishness in exalting and glorifying the Supreme One of the universe to whom all praise is due. The praise of him not only is for vindicating his name but also works for salvation to the creature giving the praise. (Rom. 10:10-13) To an individual nothing could be of more value and importance than his own salvation in vindication of God’s name. Such salvation can be gained only by now openly confessing and giving praise to the Lord God through Jesus Christ his King.

<p><span class="font5">Down through the many centuries of Christendom’s religious career a mixed situation has existed in the field. The “householder” or owner of the field, Jesus Christ, did not interfere with the enemy, the Devil, in planting a multitude of religious tares who profess to be the “children of the kingdom”. He has let Satan the Devil go on uninterruptedly. He has let the tare-dominated condition of the field continue. This system or state of things is what Christ Jesus refers to as the “world” that must have an end. As the harvest is a time period of great activity, so the here-mentioned </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font5"> or consummation of the world is a period of activity that has a beginning and then a final end. When it ends, the system of things that has existed will have been completely removed, and the right state of things will be fully brought in.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations.—Rev. 20:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the millennial reign, Satan is to be loosed for his final season of activity before his everlasting destruction. Then a final test will come upon all those dwelling upon the face of the earth. The perfect-hearted princes, respecting whose physical perfection by that time there can be no doubt, will set the example for all peoples on earth by their faithful integrity in office under the test. This concluding test will complete their perfecting. Then, when Christ Jesus turns over the Kingdom to God the Father and has destroyed Satan the Devil and all who then fall to his temptation, Jehovah God will justify or pronounce perfect all the faithful ones for life unending. “It is God that justifieth.” (1 Cor. 15:24-28; Rom. 8:33) The justified faithful ones of old will live for eternity in earthly perfection.

<p><span class="font5">God fully consecrated or perfected Christ Jesus by raising him to life in the “first resurrection” to the highest heavens, to His very own right hand. All Christ’s followers who will finally be perfected as his underpriests in the skies will be those who stay faithful at their God-given posts of duty on earth, serving God at his spiritual temple, ministering to others with His Word. When God’s kingdom is set up, and when the High Priest Christ Jesus comes to the temple for judgment of the house of God, those having endured the trials and having faithfully finished their earthly service are raised from the dead to partake in Christ’s resurrection, “the first resurrection.” (Rev. 20:5) They will thus be fully consecrated or perfected as his underpriests in heaven.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The, house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.—1 Tim. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like a pillar, the church of the living God Jehovah must hold forth and display the truth, God’s Word. She must be a sign and witness to God’s truth. (Isa. 19:19, 20) She must uphold and lend support to the truth of His Word, and not be the depositary of religious traditions of men. She is not the teacher of God’s servants and witnesses, but looks to God as the Teacher .by Christ Jesus. As it is written for her benefit: “All thy children shall be taught of Jehovah.” Hence the true church, which becomes the bride of Christ, does not attempt to usurp authority over Christ Jesus her Head by claiming to be the infallible teacher of her members. She humbly bows to him as her living, ever-present teacher under God, the Head over all. She thankfully learns of him. She abhors the selfassuming attitude taken by the religious Hierarchy and its visible pontifical Head. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No doubt the conditions and events of the postwar era will serve only to increase the death rate due to diseases of the heart. Will this not be true also in a spiritual sense ? The Bible gives good reason to believe so and warns us to be on guard, more particularly so as the final end draws close. If our minds are loaded down with worries and concerns of the material things of this world and our affections are fixed upon selfish enjoyments, it will throw us off guard and turn our attention from the great issue which must be settled. It will hinder us from serving God. Keeping or guarding our hearts is a matter of life to us. As far as we ourselves are concerned, it is of the highest importance to us.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead.—Rom. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul was a house-to-house publisher of God’s kingdom, and went out in the service or ministry of Jehovah God and showed mercy to widows and orphans by preaching the Kingdom gospel to them. But, what would that amount to if Paul had at the same time, on the side, spotted himself up by friendly companionship with this world? True, he would have gotten in his time in the field service by actively giving a witness to the kingdom of God; yet he would have soiled his field-service record in God’s sight, and his partial service or ministry to Jehovah God would have been in vain and would bring him no heavenly reward. Why, to a degree even an enemy of Christ can preach the gospel, said Paul.—Phil. 1:12-17. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For we [Christians] that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.—2 Cor. 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Paul preferred to living longer in the imperfect flesh or to dying and being naked and unclothed in death’s sleep was the return of his Lord and Master Jesus Christ. He knew that then he would be resurrected to life in the “building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens”. Thus Paul would then “be with Christ”. Death, as an end to earthly anxieties, groanings and oppressions, was not what he wanted, because death not only strips us of a body but deprives us also of the privileges of serving God and his people in the flesh. Paul desired life immortal in heaven that he might thereby serve Jehovah forever together with Christ Jesus. That meant a swallowing up of mortality by life, which occurs at the resurrection of the Christians, when the returned Christ calls them forth from the graves.

<p><span class="font5">In Genesis the first book of the Bible, the two words </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">consecrate</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">consecration</span><span class="font5"> do not appear. But that there were men in holy relationship with God then we have only to turn to Hebrews, chapter eleven, for proof. Although very few, yet there were some such consecrated men. What enabled them to enter into a consecration to God was that rare quality of faith in God. One reason why these men did not have the specific words for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">consecrate</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">consecration</span><span class="font5"> used regarding them may be that they were not consecrated in the particular ways that God’s arrangement provided for the Jews by His law given through the prophet Moses. But that these men were separate from the world which is under prince Satan the Devil, and that they had set themselves apart as holy to Jehovah God, the Bible record plainly shows.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 51:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such righteousness from Jehovah is near, because since 1914 his kingdom by Christ has been in power. Only through that kingdom comes salvation and everlasting deliverance to mankind, and men must put their trust in that kingdom. This salvation has already gone forth, and the members of the body of Christ, including the remnant yet on earth, have received of its benefits. The peoples of earth are now due to receive the blessings of His salvation. Jehovah by his kingdom will break the arms of power of the demonic and human oppressors of mankind, and His brawny arms of power will rule and judge the peoples without interference. Already, by his reigning King Christ Jesus as His mighty right arm, Jehovah has dealt a powerful body blow to Satan’s demon organization and knocked it out of heaven and down to earth.

(Isa. 54:13; 30:20) This signifies a time of great enlightenment, and therefore a time of joy and gladness among His remnant. His new covenant has brought forth a people for Jehovah’s name; and in these final years of its operation the remnant of this new nation are now giving all nations the benefit of their enlightenment. They are letting the glorious light of God’s instruction shine to all peoples sitting in this world’s darkness.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Praise the Lord, all you heathen.-Rom. 15:11, Goodsp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that Jehovah’s praise leads the opposite way from that of praise to heroes and prominent, popular ones of this world, the call, <sup>;</sup>‘Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations,” becomes a challenge. For what reason? Because the gods of the nations of this world are idols and symbolic figures of this world and even devils. It now turns men of all nations from worship and idolatry of the United Nations organization. It sets the praiser of Jehovah at odds with this entire world and its god, Satan the Devil. But it is a call to what is right and righteous, and it sets one to. doing that which gains the reward of endless life, peace and prosperity in the “world to come”. Being called to unity of action in praising Jehovah, the nations responding become truly united nations, and are such out of a common love of God and not out of fear of a world organization with A bombs. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The offspring whom the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors bring forth in fulfillment of the divine mandate then reissued will be obliged to become numbered among the Good Shepherd’s “other sheep” in order to gain eternal life on earth. Later, during his reign of a thousand years, the others of mankind dead in the graves will hear his command to come forth. Having done evil during this life while Satan was on the loose, they will then come forth, “they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28,29, A.S.P.) This “judgment” will determine if they will hear the voice of the Good Shepherd, to whom the Father has committed all judgment. If they do hear and faithfully obey, they become his sheep and he puts them among his “one flock”. They benefit by his death. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/16</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This makes it very plain that the heart or mind of a child, unless properly taught and guided by its guardians, will go in the way of foolishness or folly. Now, more than ever, the mind and heart of children of persons consecrated to God need protective knowledge and Scriptural guidance, into right thought and action. If left uncorrected and free to run a foolish and evil course, the mind or heart of the child in its formative state will become habituated in such folly or foolishness. The “rod of correction” that is applied represents parental authority and power, the same as a scepter represents that of a ruler. Applying it means to exercise the power and authority entrusted to parents in whatever way may seem wise and suitable to correct the child with effect. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those whom Jehovah takes into the new covenant over Christ’s one sacrifice to become members of his “holy nation” or “people for his name” are receivers of His unspeakable loving-kindness. Hence they are called by Him “my saints”, or, better translated, “my men of loving-kindness.” In the Bible, and especially in the Psalms, the mercy or loving-kindness of God to men is more outstanding than is the mercy or loving-kindness of godly men to others. Hence “my saints” undoubtedly means the ones who have received of His mercy and loving-kindness through Christ by being taken into the new covenant by Jesus’ sacrifice. Of all those who profess to be in the new covenant (and all the sects of Christendom so profess to be) there is only a remnant who actually are in it and living up to their covenant obligations to be a people for Jehovah’s name, His witnesses.—Isa. 1:2, 3, 9.

In this final age of the world, the atomic age, when the mass of humanity is defiling itself with all the worldly schemes for salvation, peace and prosperity without God’s kingdom, we must keep clean from its religion, its propaganda, its political crookedness, its commercial worship of Mammon or worldly goods, and its defiance of Jehovah and his universal sovereignty. “If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sanctified,</span><span class="font5"> and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.” (2 Tim. 2:21) The joyful outcome will be eternal life in the New World.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezek. 37:24,25, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The David here meant is not the faithful David of old who is soon to be resurrected from death to life on earth under God’s kingdom, but is Christ Jesus. Jehovah God has clothed him with immortality to be a “perpetual prince” in the heavens at His own right hand. Worldly rulers have been like strong animals among the professed “sheep” of God and have selfishly pushed aside the others in order to have the first and the best for themselves. The way the nations persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses during World Wars I and II fully substantiates this. Ezekiel, chapter 34, foretold this which is true of our day. It showed that Jehovah God would bring relief to his sheep by means of a David greater than the ancient king. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Christ Jesus as High Priest calls them forth from the grave, their being raised from the dead will be the first of their blessings coming to them from Jehovah through his promised Seed of Abraham, Christ Jesus. Their being made perfect does not require they shall come forth from the tombs instantaneously perfect in body, but it does show they will gain absolute perfection through God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. At Hebrews 11:35 it is written that they endured great sufferings and torments at enemy hands and refused to become unfaithful to God “that they might obtain a better resurrection”. This, therefore, serves to put them in the class of those who come forth from the tombs to the resurrection of life, rather than to a judgment the final determination of which is doubtful, either to life or to eternal destruction.

Yes, now his mercy is widened out to take in “whosoever” will Call upon Jehovah’s name, even if they are not of the remnant of spiritual Israelites. (Joel 2 :32) Whosoever will may come in answer to the invitation and may partake of the life-giving waters of the river of Kingdom truth. In view of such mercy regardless of nationality or people, the anointed remnant call with might and main upon willing persons everywhere to unite with them in praising the merciful Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">The sin offering was slain in the tabernacle court surrounded by white-linen hangings. So Jesus was slain on earth but within God’s righteous arrangement. Jesus was righteous, being without blemish in a human sense, no less than the typical animal victim was without blemish as a bull-calf. His blood provided sin-atonement for all believers of mankind. “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement.” (Lev. 17:11) In harmony with this fact the victim’s blood was applied by the high priest Aaron to the altar horns and poured out at its base.

They are gathered out, not of the invisible heavenly kingdom, for they were never up there in it; but out’ of the visible organization on earth of those who are heirs of the kingdom above with Christ. Down till harvest the tares were in among such, or not clearly identified as separate and distinct from such. Now the angels separate the tares as of a different variety. Thus these tares are gathered out of “his kingdom” either by being bodily separated from among the organization of the wheat class with which they have physically been associated or by being separated from the wheat class in the people’s minds through a showing up of the difference between them.

Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.” (22:17 ; 23:12) If he thus seeks after a heart filled with knowledge, which knowledge expresses the wisdom of God, then he benefits himself for all time.

No peace and joy come from unfaithfulness, but it causes only disturbance inside oneself and among those with whom the unfaithful one is associated. So, to preserve ourselves as Jehovah’s worshipers unspotted from this world in its last days, we must occupy ourselves with the worship and service of Him to the exclusion of the things of the enemy organization.

The nineteenth chapter of the last book of the Bible shows that this great Hallelujah due to victory of Jehovah’s truth over the Babylonish system of error will go forth from a tremendous multitude out of nations and peoples. (Rev. 19:1-6) The chorus of Hallelujahs now sounding from all quarters of this globe must increase in volume and extent, from those who believe Jehovah God is true. More and more his truth is shown up in glorified contrast with this world and its dominant elements.

<p><span class="font5">The effect of the light shining from God’s Word is to divide off the believing Gentiles from the darksome organization controlled by Satan, and to draw them to Jehovah God. Next, to render them acceptable to Him their faith in the blood of Christ results in their being purified and cleansed from sins by God’s forgiveness of them. They become part of the church which is “sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all”. That the sanctifying process may continue in all such they must keep on exercising faith in God and Christ and the divine Word. The basis of faith is, of course, knowledge; and the knowledge must be that of God’s Word. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Keep the unity of the spirit.—Eph. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible is not a divisive Book, for it is harmonious from cover to cover and agrees with itself, in all its canonical books. The divisive force among the Catholic and Protestant religionists of Christendom is the religious traditions which they follow. The truth of the Bible is a unifying power. After Christ Jesus prayed: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth,” he immediately prayed that all believers, those then following him and those yet due to believe, should be united in one, just as he and his heavenly Father are one. (John 17:17-23) It is now that this Christian oneness must be attained, now at this end of the world. It </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font5"> been attained by Jehovah’s witnesses, who have come forth from inside and outside of the multitude of religious organizations and who now unite in God’s service despite their former religious disagreements. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">December 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I heard</span><span class="font5"> as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God.—Rev. 19:1,</span><span class="font6"> A.S.P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span><span class="font5"> is made up of two Hebrew words and means “Praise ye Jah [or Jehovah]”. So, with fitness, we ask about that great multitude in heaven this question : When they cried out </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span><span class="font5"> and gave their accompanying tributes to the One sitting upon the throne of the universe, just whose witnesses were they ? And in recording these things, just whose witness did the Christian apostle John consider himself to be? The one answer must be, Jah’s or Jehovah’s. Seeing that this “Hallelujah” vision applies now, let all Christians who today choose to be distinguished from mere professing Christians by being known as “Jehovah’s witnesses” not be ashamed to be called such. Without embarrassment let them continue to face those who challenge their right to be called “Jehovah’s witnesses”, and continue to testify to His name.

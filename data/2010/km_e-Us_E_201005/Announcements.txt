Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on placing What Does the Bible Really Teach? The objective is to start a Bible study. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer Draw Close to Jehovah, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, Worship the Only True God, or any other field service publication that the congregation has in stock. July and August: Keep on the Watch! or What Does God Require of Us? If the congregation does not have a supply of these brochures, offer any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, and Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?
▪ A limited supply of the 2010 edition of the brochure Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide is being sent to each congregation. Publishers interested in the options available to support Kingdom interests financially, including some with tax benefits, will find this brochure helpful.

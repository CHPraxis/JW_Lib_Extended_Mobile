<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. How do we know that nothing can stop the preaching work?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Absolutely nothing can stop Jehovah from accomplishing his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:14:24-23:14:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 14:24</a>) Though Judge Gideon and his 300 men faced seemingly impossible odds against an army of 135,000 Midianites, Jehovah told him: “You will certainly save Israel out of Midian’s palm. Do I not send you?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:6:14-7:6:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 6:14</a>) What work has Jehovah’s backing today? Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) No one will be able to stop this work from being accomplished!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. Why can we expect Jehovah to help us personally in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Jehovah Helps Us Personally: </strong>While we can be confident that Jehovah will make his Witnesses successful as a group, can we expect Jehovah to help us personally? During a time of need, the apostle Paul felt Jehovah’s personal support through his Son, Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:17-55:4:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:17</a>) We can be confident that Jehovah will likewise bless our individual efforts to accomplish his will.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. In what circumstances does Jehovah help us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Do the daily cares of life leave you with little energy for the ministry? “He is giving to the tired one power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 40:29-31</a>) Are you facing persecution or opposition? “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22</a>) Do you sometimes lack confidence? “Go, and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:11-2:4:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 4:11, 12</a>) Do you have health problems that limit your share in the ministry? Jehovah values and can use your whole-souled efforts, no matter how small.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. How will having confidence in Jehovah affect us?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jehovah’s hand “is the one stretched out, and who can turn it back?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:14:27-23:14:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 14:27</a>) Confident of Jehovah’s blessing upon our ministry, may we continue without letup preaching “with boldness by the authority of Jehovah.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:3-44:14:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 14:3</a>.</p>

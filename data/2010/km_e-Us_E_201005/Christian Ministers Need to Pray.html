<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What is necessary in order to accomplish our ministry?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We cannot accomplish the ministry by ourselves. Jehovah gives us strength to do the work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 4:13</a>) He uses his angels to assist us in finding sheeplike ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6, 7</a>) It is Jehovah who causes seeds of truth that we plant and water to grow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9</a>) How important it is for Christian ministers to rely on our heavenly Father in prayer!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. What are some things for which to pray?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>For Ourselves: </strong>We should pray on each occasion that we preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:18-49:6:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18</a>) What are some things for which to pray? We could pray for a positive attitude about our territory and for boldness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:29-44:4:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 4:29</a>) We could ask Jehovah to direct us to righthearted individuals with whom we may study the Bible. If the householder asks us a question, we can say a brief silent prayer asking Jehovah to help us make a proper reply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:2:4-16:2:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh. 2:4</a>) We may also ask for wisdom to keep the ministry our priority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) In addition, Jehovah is pleased when we include expressions of thankfulness for the privilege of being his ministers.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How does praying for others further the preaching work?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>For Others: </strong>We should also “pray for one another,” even mentioning fellow ministers by name when appropriate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:16-59:5:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jas. 5:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:5-44:12:5" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Acts 12:5</a>) Does failing health limit what you can do in the preaching work? Then pray for fellow ministers who are in good health. Never underestimate the force of your prayers in their behalf! It is also proper to pray for the authorities to be favorably disposed toward the preaching work, so that our brothers “may go on leading a calm and quiet life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:1-54:2:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we persevere in prayer?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Declaring the good news in all the inhabited earth is a daunting assignment. If we “persevere in prayer,” we will accomplish the work with Jehovah’s help.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>.</p>

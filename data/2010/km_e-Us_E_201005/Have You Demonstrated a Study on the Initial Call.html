<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When offered a Bible study, some householders say that they are not interested or that they have a Bible study at their church. Since they can only compare the concept of a Bible study to their past experience, they have no idea what an enlightening and pleasurable experience it can be. Therefore, rather than simply <em>offering </em>a study, why not take a couple of minutes to <em>demonstrate </em>the Bible study arrangement on the initial call? To illustrate: Do not just tell them that you are a good cook and offer to come back with a meal; give them a taste right away! Here is how you can do that in only a few minutes, based on a suggestion from <a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:202006005/1-16">page 6 of the January 2006 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry</em></a><em>:</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Do you think the day will ever come when these words are fulfilled? [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>, and allow for response.] Let me show you something interesting on the subject.” Hand the householder a <em>Bible Teach </em>book, and refer him to <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005133/31-31">paragraph 22 on page 36</a>. Read the question at the bottom of the page, and ask the householder to look for the answer as you read the paragraph. Then ask the question again, and listen to the householder’s comment. Read another of the scriptures together. Raise a question to be answered on the next visit, and make definite arrangements to return. You have just started a Bible study!</p>

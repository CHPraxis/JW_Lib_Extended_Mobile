‘This Good News Will Be Preached’!
 1. How do we know that nothing can stop the preaching work?
1 Absolutely nothing can stop Jehovah from accomplishing his will. (Isa. 14:24) Though Judge Gideon and his 300 men faced seemingly impossible odds against an army of 135,000 Midianites, Jehovah told him: “You will certainly save Israel out of Midian’s palm. Do I not send you?” (Judg. 6:14) What work has Jehovah’s backing today? Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” (Matt. 24:14) No one will be able to stop this work from being accomplished!
 2. Why can we expect Jehovah to help us personally in the ministry?
2 Jehovah Helps Us Personally: While we can be confident that Jehovah will make his Witnesses successful as a group, can we expect Jehovah to help us personally? During a time of need, the apostle Paul felt Jehovah’s personal support through his Son, Jesus. (2 Tim. 4:17) We can be confident that Jehovah will likewise bless our individual efforts to accomplish his will.—1 John 5:14.
 3. In what circumstances does Jehovah help us?
3 Do the daily cares of life leave you with little energy for the ministry? “He is giving to the tired one power.” (Isa. 40:29-31) Are you facing persecution or opposition? “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.” (Ps. 55:22) Do you sometimes lack confidence? “Go, and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth.” (Ex. 4:11, 12) Do you have health problems that limit your share in the ministry? Jehovah values and can use your whole-souled efforts, no matter how small.—1 Cor. 3:6, 9.
 4. How will having confidence in Jehovah affect us?
4 Jehovah’s hand “is the one stretched out, and who can turn it back?” (Isa. 14:27) Confident of Jehovah’s blessing upon our ministry, may we continue without letup preaching “with boldness by the authority of Jehovah.”—Acts 14:3.

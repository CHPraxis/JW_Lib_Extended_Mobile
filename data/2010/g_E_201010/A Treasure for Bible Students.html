<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● </strong>This is what the brochure <em>“See the Good Land” </em>has proved to be. It is filled with colorful maps and photographs of sites where major events of Bible history occurred over a period of more than 2,000 years. Included is a panoramic view of the ruins of ancient Beer-sheba, where Abraham lived, and a photograph of a Roman road that disciples of Christ likely traveled toward the end of the first century C.E.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many of our readers have expressed appreciation for the brochure. “I am overwhelmed with gratitude,” one wrote. “I have always yearned to visualize the land of the patriarchs and the land Jesus walked.” Another said: “It is something I have wanted for a long time. It really makes the Bible come alive.”</p>

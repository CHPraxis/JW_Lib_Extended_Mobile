Purpose of Study Articles
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 7-11
God’s servants need his blessing in order to meet his righteous requirements. What sort of effort is needed? How can Jehovah’s holy spirit help us to deal with any challenges that may confront us?
STUDY ARTICLES 2, 3  PAGES 12-20
These articles will help us to appreciate how good and how pleasant it is to dwell together in unity with our brothers. We will see why only Jehovah can unite people from all nations. Then we will consider how each of us can promote the unity of the congregation, thus glorifying God.
STUDY ARTICLES 4, 5  PAGES 21-29
These two articles will help us to be more aware of Christ, our heavenly King, in his role as our active Leader. He is attentive to what is going on in each congregation of his disciples on earth today.

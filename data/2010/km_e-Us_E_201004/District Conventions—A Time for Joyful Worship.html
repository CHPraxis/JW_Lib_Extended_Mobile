<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>District Conventions<wbr />—A Time for Joyful Worship</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="qu"> 1. How were Israel’s festivals similar to our modern district conventions?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[12]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Joseph, Mary, their children, and others regularly went up to Jerusalem to attend the annual festivals. On these occasions, they and other worshippers would leave behind their daily cares and focus on the more important spiritual aspects of their life. The festivals afforded time to reflect on and talk about Jehovah’s goodness and to consider his Law. Our upcoming district conventions will give us similar opportunities for joyful worship of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="qu"> 2. What should we do to prepare for the upcoming district convention?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[13]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Preparation Needed: </strong>Traveling from Nazareth required that Jesus’ family walk about 120 miles <strong>[200 km] </strong>round-trip. Though we do not know how many siblings Jesus had, we can imagine the planning and effort required of Joseph and Mary. Have you made the necessary preparations to attend all three days of the upcoming district convention? This may require taking vacation from work or speaking to your employer or your child’s teacher about having time off. Have you made a hotel reservation if this is needed? Could you take the initiative to help someone in the congregation with special needs to attend the convention?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 3:17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="qu"> 3. How did Israel’s festivals provide opportunities for upbuilding association?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[14]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Upbuilding Fellowship: </strong>What an opportunity the Jewish festivals provided for upbuilding association with fellow worshippers! Jesus’ family no doubt looked forward to being reunited with longtime friends. They also enjoyed opportunities to make new friends among the throngs of Jews and proselytes who would be present or traveling to and from Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="qu"> 4. How may we demonstrate that we do not take for granted our united Christian brotherhood?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[15]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>One reason the faithful and discreet slave arranges for us to come together to hear talks at district conventions instead of presenting the same information in printed form is so that we can encourage one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Therefore, make plans to arrive at the convention early each day to enjoy fellowship with others before the session chairman introduces a musical interlude, signaling that it is time to be seated. Instead of leaving the facility at noon to obtain food, we are encouraged to bring a light lunch and remain at the convention so that we can meet and talk with those around us. Our united Christian brotherhood is a gift from Jehovah that we should never take for granted.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic. 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="qu"> 5. What will help us to benefit fully from the program?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>A Time to Learn: </strong>From a young age, Jesus took advantage of the festivals to learn about his heavenly Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:41-42:2:49" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 2:41-49</a>) What will help us and our families to benefit fully from the parts that will be presented? During the sessions, remain seated and avoid talking needlessly. Do not allow your cell phone, pager, or other similar devices to disturb you or others. Focus your eyes on the speaker, and take brief notes. Sit together as a family to make sure that your children are also listening. In the evening take some time to discuss together the points that you enjoyed.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="qu"> 6. What should we keep in mind regarding our dress and grooming?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[17]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Dress and Grooming: </strong>Foreign merchants traveling on the road could easily recognize Jesus’ family and other Jewish worshippers who were traveling to and from the festivals because of the fringed edges on their garments and the blue string above the fringe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:15:37-4:15:41" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 15:37-41</a>) Though Christians do not wear distinctive garb, we are known for dressing modestly and being neat and clean. We should give particular attention to our appearance when traveling to and from the convention and while in the convention city. Even if we change clothes after the program, we should maintain a dignified appearance and wear our convention <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>badge. In this way we will stand out from non-Witnesses and make a good impression on observers.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="qu"> 7. Why should we consider volunteering to work at the convention?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[18]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong>Volunteers Needed: </strong>Many workers are needed in order for the convention to run smoothly. Could you volunteer to assist? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) The work done at conventions is part of our sacred service and gives a fine witness. The manager of one convention facility was so impressed by the volunteers who cleaned the building that he wrote this: “I want to thank you for the most amazing event that I have ever experienced. I have always heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses were special people with a long-standing reputation in our industry of always leaving a facility cleaner than they found it. You and your organization made this facility a better place for the community and did it with the most gracious group of people with which we have ever had the pleasure of being acquainted.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="qu"> 8. What opportunities for witnessing will there be in the convention city?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[19]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>Opportunities to Witness: </strong>Many in the convention city will notice well-dressed, clean-cut visitors wearing convention badges, and this may arouse their curiosity, providing opportunities for us to tell them about the convention. One four-year-old brought his copy of a newly released publication to a restaurant after the program and showed it to the waitress. This opened the way for the boy’s parents to invite the woman to the convention.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="qu"> 9. How may we imitate the appreciation of Jesus’ family for Jehovah’s spiritual provisions?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[20]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The ancient festivals were joyful occasions that spiritually-minded Jews looked forward to. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:16:15-5:16:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 16:15</a>) Jesus’ family was happy to make any sacrifices to attend and benefit fully. We have similar appreciation for our district conventions, viewing them as a gift from our loving heavenly Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) Now is the time to prepare for this annual opportunity for joyful worship of Jehovah!</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc"><strong>District Convention Reminders</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="su">▪ <strong>Program Times: </strong>The program will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. When the introductory music is announced, all of us should be at our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:40 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="su">▪ <strong>Parking: </strong>At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available to attendees at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Only persons who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the area reserved for the disabled. Since parking is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="su">▪ <strong>Seat Saving: </strong>Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home, as well as those with whom you are currently conducting a Bible study.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="su">▪ <strong>Noon Meal: </strong>Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="su">▪ <strong>Donations: </strong>We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="su">▪ <strong>Accidents and Emergencies: </strong>If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel on-site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911. This will prevent emergency-response services from receiving many cell-phone calls over minor matters.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">▪ <strong>Footwear: </strong>Each year a number of injuries occur that are related to footwear. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow one to walk safely on stairs, gratings, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su">▪ <strong>Hearing Impaired: </strong>The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="su">▪ <strong>Recording: </strong>Recording devices should not be connected to the facility’s electric or sound system and may be used only in a way that does not disturb others.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="su">▪ <strong>Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </strong>Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats that can be secured in a seat next to the parents are acceptable.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="su">▪ <strong>Fragrances: </strong>Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in persons with respiratory or related problems.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="su">▪ <strong>Follow-Up Forms: </strong>A <em>Please Follow Up </em>(S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any interest from informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room or given to your congregation secretary on your return.<wbr />—See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:202009405/5:78-8">November 2009 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>p. 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="su">▪ <strong>Restaurants: </strong>Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. It is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="su">▪ <strong>Hotels: </strong>(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than you will actually use, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness. (8) The room rate shown on the <em>Recommended Lodging List </em>is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged or billed for things you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible. (9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so they can assist you.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="su">▪ <strong>Volunteer Service: </strong>The happiness we gain from attending the convention will be even greater if we volunteer to assist with the necessary work involved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Any who wish to do so should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent or guardian or other adult approved by one of them.</p>

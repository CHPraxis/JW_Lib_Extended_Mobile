Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on placing What Does the Bible Really Teach? The objective is to start a Bible study. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer Draw Close to Jehovah, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, Worship the Only True God, or any other field service publication that the congregation has in stock. July: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock, except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, and Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe? Congregations that have a supply of What Does God Require of Us? should feature this brochure.
▪ During the weeks of the district convention, circuit assembly, and special assembly day, the congregation will not have the Congregation Bible Study, the Theocratic Ministry School, and the Service Meeting. This being the case, we encourage all to consider the material for these three meetings on a personal basis, such as during your Family Worship evening.
▪ The special talk for the 2010 Memorial season will be entitled “Real Peace and Security—When?”

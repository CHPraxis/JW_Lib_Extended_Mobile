<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What did Jesus’ disciples learn from watching him?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus said: “Get under my yoke with me and learn from me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:29-40:11:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>, ftn.) Clearly, he taught others by setting a good example, not just by his words. Think of what the disciples learned from watching Jesus. He was gentle, kind, and loving. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:1-40:8:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 8:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:6:30-41:6:34" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mark 6:30-34</a>) He was genuinely humble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:2-43:13:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:2-5</a>) As they accompanied Jesus in the ministry, the disciples saw that he was a tireless worker who was effective in teaching the truth to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:37-42:21:38" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21:37, 38</a>) How are others affected by observing us in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How does our fine demeanor in the ministry leave a good impression on householders?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Householders: </strong>Our modest dress, good manners, and sincere personal interest in people can have a powerful effect on householders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:27-50:1:27" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Phil. 1:27</a>) They notice that we make frequent use of the Bible. Others are impressed that we listen respectfully when they speak. Never underestimate how setting a good example in these areas can draw people to the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. What positive effect can we have on our brothers?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Our Brothers: </strong>Think, too, of the positive effect we can have on our brothers. Our zeal for the ministry is contagious. As iron sharpens iron, our well-prepared presentation impels others to hone their evangelizing skills. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 27:17</a>) Our diligence in keeping an accurate record of those who show interest and then returning promptly helps motivate others to do the same. We <span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>will have a wholesome influence on fellow workers by fully accomplishing our ministry.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we periodically analyze our example?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Why not periodically analyze what you do and say and how you affect others by means of your example? Our good example will please Jehovah and enable us to echo the sentiments of the apostle Paul when he declared: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:1</a>.</p>

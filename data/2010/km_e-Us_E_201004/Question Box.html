<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Should Jehovah’s Witnesses circulate recordings or transcripts of talks?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We are strengthened and encouraged by Bible discourses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:32-44:15:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:32</a>) Therefore, it is natural to want to share such encouraging information with those who were not present. With the advent of various recording devices, a talk can be recorded and distributed to others at a moment’s notice. Some have maintained a collection of recorded talks, including talks that were given many years ago, and with good motive they lend these talks or reproduce them for friends. Others have created Web sites and posted talks there for anyone to download.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Understandably, there is no objection if we record talks for personal use or for members of our family. In addition, elders may arrange for talks to be recorded for infirm members of the congregation who are unable to attend the meetings. However, there are good reasons for us <em>not </em>to circulate transcripts or recordings of talks.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Because talks are often delivered with local needs in mind, we could easily misconstrue points from a circulated recording, since we would not be aware of the setting in which the talk was given. In addition, it would be difficult for us to verify who gave the talk and when, so that we can have confidence that the information presented is up-to-date and accurate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:1-42:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 1:1-4</a>) Further, circulating transcripts or recordings of talks might tempt some to give or accept undue attention and honor.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:5-46:3:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The faithful and discreet slave works hard to provide spiritual food in the right “measure” and at “the proper time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:42-42:12:42" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 12:42</a>) This includes the arrangement for talks to be given at local congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses and audio recordings that can be downloaded from the official jw.org Web site. We can be confident that the faithful and discreet slave and its Governing Body will provide what we need in order to be made firm in the faith.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:16:4-44:16:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 16:4, 5</a>.</p>

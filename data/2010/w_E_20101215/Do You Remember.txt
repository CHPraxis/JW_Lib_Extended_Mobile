Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• Belief in predestination marks the religious descendants of whom?
Calvinism emphasizes the doctrine of predestination. The teachings of Reformer Jean Cauvin (John Calvin) flourish in such denominations as Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Puritan.—9/1, pages 18-21.
• Where did Cain find his wife?
Cain’s wife must have been a descendant of Eve, who gave birth to “sons and daughters.” (Gen. 5:4)—9/1, page 25.
• God sent which angel ahead of Israel when bringing them out of Egypt? (Ex. 23:20, 21)
It is reasonable to believe that the angel who had ‘Jehovah’s name within him’ was God’s firstborn Son, who later became Jesus.—9/15, page 21.
• Why was meat sacrificed to idols discussed in the book of 1 Corinthians?
Animals were sacrificed in Greek and Roman temples, but meat not eaten during the ceremony might be sold in public meat markets. Christians did not share in pagan worship; yet they did not need to view meat from that source as contaminated when it was sold in the market. The apostle Paul wrote: “Everything that is sold in a meat market keep eating, making no inquiry on account of your conscience; for ‘to Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it.’” (1 Cor. 10:25, 26)—10/1, page 12.
• Regarding true worship, what are some excuses that are not acceptable to God?
‘It is too difficult. I do not want to. I am too busy. I am not good enough. Someone hurt my feelings.’ Those are not valid excuses for failing to carry out God’s commands.—10/15, pages 12-15.
• What are some ways that you can make Christian meetings upbuilding for yourself and others?
Prepare in advance. Attend regularly. Arrive on time. Come well-equipped. Avoid distractions. Participate. Keep your comments brief. Fulfill your assignments. Commend participants. Associate before and after meetings.—10/15, page 22.
• Leprosy, which includes what is now called Hansen’s disease, figured in what Bible account involving a young girl?
Second Kings chapter 5 tells of an Israelite girl, a servant in the house of a Syrian army chief named Naaman. Because he suffered from leprosy, she recommended that he go to the prophet Elisha to get healed.—11/1, page 22.
• What can we learn from Aaron’s giving in to peer pressure?
While Moses was not present, the Israelites urged Aaron to make a god for them. He caved in and did so. This shows that peer pressure is not limited to youths. It can affect even older ones who want to do what is right. We need to resist negative peer pressure.—11/15, page 8.
• Which are fact, and which are fiction?
Satan is a real person: fact. (2 Cor. 11:14) At death all people pass on to the spirit realm: fiction. (Eccl. 9:5) Faithful angels care about us: fact. (Ps. 34:7) Jesus is equal to God: fiction. (1 Cor. 11:3)—12/1, pages 8-9.

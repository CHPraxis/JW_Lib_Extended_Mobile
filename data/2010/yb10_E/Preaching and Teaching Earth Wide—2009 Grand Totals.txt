Preaching and Teaching Earth Wide​—2009 Grand Totals
JEHOVAH offers to people everywhere a precious gift​—the good news of the Kingdom. We who have accepted that gift and who love Jehovah have the privilege of sharing it with others. In so doing, we experience the joy of pleasing both the Giver of that gift and those who receive it. Truly, the preaching of the good news is an expression of our love for God and for neighbor. (Matt. 22:37-40) In the pages that follow, read how Jehovah’s people are demonstrating that love through their zealous preaching earth wide.

‘Love Endures All Things. Love Never Fails.’​—1 CORINTHIANS 13:7, 8.
Increasingly in these “last days,” people are “lovers of themselves, lovers of money, [and] lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” (2 Tim. 3:1-4) What a refreshing contrast is found in those who serve Jehovah! It is love that motivates us to preach God’s Word. Love inspires us to “work what is good toward all.” (Gal. 6:10) And it is love that identifies us as true disciples of Christ.​—John 13:35.
How important it is to keep cultivating our love for Jehovah and his dear Son, Jesus Christ, by reflecting on all they have done for us! Vital too is the need to grow in our love for our brothers and for those who have not yet come to know Jehovah. Though trials will come our way, love will help us to endure. May the yeartext for 2010 remind us to keep growing in this precious quality, love.

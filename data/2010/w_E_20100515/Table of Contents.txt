Purpose of Study Articles
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 8-17
The first study article shows how important it is for men to be in subjection to their Head, the Christ, and to imitate him in their dealings with others. The second article explains how Christian women should view the statement: “The head of a woman is the man.”
STUDY ARTICLES 3, 4  PAGES 24-32
For many today, the thought of making personal sacrifices for someone else does not have much appeal. The first article is designed especially to assist baptized men to examine their view of self-sacrifice and the shouldering of responsibility as ministerial servants or elders. The second article explains how we can avoid grieving God’s holy spirit.

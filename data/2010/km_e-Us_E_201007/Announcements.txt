Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July and August: Keep on the Watch! or What Does God Require of Us? If the congregation does not have a supply of these brochures, offer any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, and Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe? September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study.
▪ Bibles other than the New World Translation are purchased by the organization at considerable cost. Such purchased Bibles should not be offered in the field ministry. These Bibles are special-request items and should be requested only for baptized and unbaptized publishers and progressive Bible students who do not have a Bible. Individuals qualified to receive a Bible should not feel obligated to make a contribution equal to the cost of the Bible if their circumstances do not permit such. Each one may make a contribution in harmony with his ability to do so.—2 Cor. 9:7.

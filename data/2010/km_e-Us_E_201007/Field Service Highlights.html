<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The March report for the United States was outstanding! New peaks in hours, return visits, and Bible studies were reached. There are now 698,507 persons studying with us. Also, a new peak of 2,485,231 gathered for the Memorial on March 30<wbr />—a fine increase of 16,195 over last year’s attendance and 1,388,729 more than the average number of publishers who reported during the 2009 service year. What fine potential for further increase!</p>

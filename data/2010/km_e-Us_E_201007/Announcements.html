<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Bibles other than the <em>New World Translation </em>are purchased by the organization at considerable cost. Such purchased Bibles should not be offered in the field ministry. These Bibles are special-request items and should be requested only for baptized and unbaptized publishers and progressive Bible students who do not have a Bible. Individuals qualified to receive a Bible should not feel obligated to make a contribution equal to the cost of the Bible if their circumstances do not permit such. Each one may make a contribution in harmony with his ability to do so.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7</a>.</p>

Field Service Highlights
The March report for the United States was outstanding! New peaks in hours, return visits, and Bible studies were reached. There are now 698,507 persons studying with us. Also, a new peak of 2,485,231 gathered for the Memorial on March 30—a fine increase of 16,195 over last year’s attendance and 1,388,729 more than the average number of publishers who reported during the 2009 service year. What fine potential for further increase!

Field Service Highlights
What a joy to report that 5,042 publishers were baptized during the month of June in the United States! Also, the number of regular pioneers has increased by 7.7 percent over the previous service year. Publishers in the Turks and Caicos Islands are indeed “aglow with the spirit,” as noted in the exceptional 44.3 percent increase in return visits and 48.9 percent increase in Bible studies during this same period! (Rom. 12:11) They reached a new all-time peak of 251 publishers in June.

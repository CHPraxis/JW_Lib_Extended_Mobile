<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What will we offer during November, and what is the purpose of this publication?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>At our “Keep on the Watch!” District Convention in 2009, a new brochure was released entitled <em>The Bible<wbr />—What Is Its Message?</em> During November congregations around the world will offer it for the first time. How will this publication benefit people in our territory? Most people, especially those in non-Christian religions, know little about the Bible. Therefore, the brochure explains on <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009450/1-6">page 3</a> that it is designed to provide “an overview of the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How might we offer the brochure?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>How to Offer It: </strong>We could say something like this: “We would like to get your opinion on what this says. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.] Many we talk to agree with these words; others feel that the Bible is nothing more than a good book. What do you think about the Bible? [Allow for response.] Whatever our religious beliefs may be, there are good reasons to examine the Bible for ourselves. [Read the introductory paragraph at the top of <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009450/2-2">page 3</a>.] As you read the fast-moving summary of the Bible found in this brochure, you will see something interesting: The Bible has one overall theme and message.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. What is another presentation that we might use, especially in territory where many belong to a non-Christian religion?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Here is another option, especially when preaching where many people belong to a non-Christian religion: “We would like to get your opinion on what is stated here in the Scriptures (or in this holy book). [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>.] What do you think the earth will be like when this prophecy is fulfilled? [Allow for response.] This is an example of the hope and comfort that people of all cultures and faiths can receive from the Bible.” Read the paragraph at the top of <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009450/2-2">page 3</a>, and offer the brochure.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. How may we use the brochure to start a Bible study?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Start a Bible Study: </strong>When we return we could remind the householder of our previous conversation and consider a paragraph or two on the subject we discussed, using the questions at the end of the appropriate section. Or if we wish to introduce the <em>Bible Teach </em>book right away, we could read with him the back cover of the brochure, hand him the book, ask which of the chapter titles interests him, and consider a paragraph or two from that chapter together. May all of us have a full share in offering this brochure during November!</p>

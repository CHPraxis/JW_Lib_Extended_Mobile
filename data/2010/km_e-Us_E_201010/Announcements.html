<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>and endeavor to start a Bible study. <strong>November: </strong><em>The Bible<wbr />—What Is Its Message? </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>If there are children in the household, offer <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em><strong>January: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>and <em>Worship the Only True God </em>may offer either of these books. Otherwise, publishers may offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregation publishers must not put handbills, tracts, magazines, or any other literature in householders’ mailboxes since that is prohibited by postal regulations in the United States.</p>

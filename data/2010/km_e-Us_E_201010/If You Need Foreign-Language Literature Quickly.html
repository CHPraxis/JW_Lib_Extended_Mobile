<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">At times we meet people who prefer to read our literature in a foreign language that our congregation does not have in stock. Did you know that if you have access to the Internet and a printer, you can print literature in about 400 languages yourself? Here is how:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="su">• Go to www.watchtower.org, our official Web site.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">• On the right side of the home page is a partial list of languages. Click on the picture of the globe for a list of all the available languages.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">• Click on the language you want. A page will appear that shows the literature that you can print, such as tracts, brochures, and articles. Since this page is written in the language you have chosen, do not worry if you do not recognize the titles.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">• Click on any item. The material will appear on the screen and can then be printed using the print feature of your browser.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Our Web site contains only a sampling; additional publications are available through the congregation. Once you establish interest, it is best to request literature from the literature counter.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. November: The Bible—What Is Its Message? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. If there are children in the household, offer Learn From the Great Teacher. January: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and Worship the Only True God may offer either of these books. Otherwise, publishers may offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation.
▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Congregation publishers must not put handbills, tracts, magazines, or any other literature in householders’ mailboxes since that is prohibited by postal regulations in the United States.

Field Service Highlights
How thrilling it was to see over 20 million hours reported in the United States for May 2010! This eclipsed the total for May 2009 by half a million. Also during May 2010, nearly 12.6 million magazines were distributed. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, an all-time peak of 719 Bible studies was reported. May we all continue to ‘buy out the opportune time’ for the never-to-be-repeated preaching work!—Eph. 5:16.

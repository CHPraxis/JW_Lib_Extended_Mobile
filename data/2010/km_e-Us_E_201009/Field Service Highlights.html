<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How thrilling it was to see over 20 million hours reported in the United States for May 2010! This eclipsed the total for May 2009 by half a million. Also during May 2010, nearly 12.6 million magazines were distributed. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, an all-time peak of 719 Bible studies was reported. May we all continue to ‘buy out the opportune time’ for the never-to-be-repeated preaching work!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16</a>.</p>

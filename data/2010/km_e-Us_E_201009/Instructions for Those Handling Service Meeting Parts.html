<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Beginning with this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>the wording of the Service Meeting schedule is being simplified. The following instructions and reminders will update and clarify what was stated in the article <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:202009163/1-7">“How to Prepare for the Service Meeting,”</a> which appeared in the May 2009 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">▪ <strong>Talk: </strong>This refers to a discourse based on the assigned material with no audience participation. The speaker should focus on what will be most helpful to the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">▪ <strong>Questions and Answers: </strong>Much like the <em>Watchtower </em>Study, this part has a very brief introduction and conclusion, and questions are asked on all the paragraphs. The conductor should avoid commenting excessively. Key scriptures may be read as time allows. Paragraphs are not to be read unless instructions are given to do so.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">▪ <strong>Discussion: </strong>This is a talk that includes some audience participation. It is not simply a talk, and it is not all questions and answers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">▪ <strong>Demonstrations and Interviews: </strong>Instructions to <em>demonstrate </em>mean that the brother assigned the part is responsible for including a demonstration; he personally does not have to give the demonstration. Those he chooses to help him should be capable and exemplary, and he should make arrangements with them well in advance if possible. It is best not to use new and inexperienced publishers to demonstrate how the work is to be done simply to give them the opportunity to be on the platform, although some can be used as householders. Publishers demonstrating a presentation should take care to face the audience. Those used in an <em>interview </em>are to give their comments from the platform rather than from their seat. Demonstrations and interviews should be rehearsed. If the meeting is running overtime and a brother must shorten his part, he will avoid deleting demonstrations or interviews. Ministerial servants should check with the coordinator of the body of elders or another elder before selecting participants.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">If a unique part has special instructions, these should be carefully followed. By delivering Service Meeting parts as outlined above, brothers will contribute to Service Meetings that “take place decently and by arrangement.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:40</a>.</p>

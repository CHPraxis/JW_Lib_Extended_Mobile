<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you think that life has a purpose? Evolutionist William B. Provine says: “What we have learned about the evolutionary process has enormous implications for us, affecting our sense of meaning in life.” His conclusion? “I can see no cosmic or ultimate meaning in human life.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010239/40-40"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Consider the significance of those words. If ultimate meaning in life were nonexistent, then you would have no purpose in living other than to try to do some measure of good and perhaps pass on your genetic traits to the next generation. At death, you would cease to exist forever. Your brain, with its ability to think, reason, and meditate on the meaning of life, would simply be an accident of nature.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That is not all. Many who believe in evolution assert that God does not exist or that he will not intervene in human affairs. In either case, our future would rest in the hands of political, academic, and religious leaders. Judging from the past record of such men, the chaos, conflict, and corruption that blight human society would continue. If, indeed, evolution were true, there would seem to be ample reason to live by the fatalistic motto: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:32-46:15:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By contrast, the Bible teaches: “With [God] is the source of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) Those words have profound implications.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If what the Bible says is true, life does have meaning. Our Creator has a loving purpose that extends to all who choose to live in accord with his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>) That purpose includes the promise of life in a world free of chaos, conflict, and corruption<wbr />—and even free of death.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:25:6-23:25:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 25:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With good reason, millions of people around the world believe that learning about God and obeying him give meaning to life as nothing else can! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Such a belief is not based on mere wishful thinking. The evidence is clear<wbr />—life was created.</p>

How Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Teach the Bible?
They teach by subject, usually by means of the study aid What Does the Bible Really Teach? Its 19 chapters include the following:
“What Is the Truth About God?”
“Who Is Jesus Christ?”
“Where Are the Dead?”
“Are We Living in ‘the Last Days’?”
“Why Does God Allow Suffering?”
“How to Make Your Family Life Happy”
Students are invited to ask questions and to see the answers for themselves in the Bible. Later, on the basis of their study of the Bible, they can decide for themselves which religion to follow.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Certain dragonflies can glide for 30 seconds without any significant loss in altitude. Their secret? An aerodynamic wing that is unlike any manufactured by the aircraft industry!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>The microthin wing of the dragonfly is corrugated, with pleats that prevent it from bending. Scientists have found that the pleats also give the dragonfly greater lift while gliding. “This is because air circulates in the cavities between pleats, creating areas of very low drag that aid the lift-generating airflow across the wing,” says <em>New Scientist </em>magazine.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After studying the wing of the dragonfly, aerospace engineer Abel Vargas and his colleagues concluded that “biologically inspired wings are very relevant in the design of micro-aerial vehicles.” Armed with a camera or other equipment, such palm-size flying robots have a number of practical uses, from obtaining information from disaster locations to monitoring pollution levels.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did the microthin, pleated wing of the dragonfly come about by chance? Or was it designed?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Irena, an 8th-grade student, lives in Kurtovo Konare, a village in Bulgaria. Her mother gave her teacher the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work </em>at a parent-teacher meeting.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Sometime afterward, the teacher, holding the book, called Irena up before the class. “Today you will conduct the class,” she told Irena. “I have selected a chapter for you to read, and I want you to describe how your family applies the suggestions in it.” The chapter she chose was “Why Should I ‘Honor My Father and My Mother’?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On Irena’s way up to the front, some of her classmates remarked that her parents were different. The teacher interrupted them and said: “Do you know why their family is different? It is because they are studying the Bible. I have taught her brothers, and never in my career as a teacher have I seen such respect and exemplary upbringing.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The teacher then asked Irena to read. After she read a paragraph that explained that God granted parents the right to set rules, the teacher asked: “Irena, how does that work in your family? Do you view as law everything your parents tell you?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Each of us may have our own opinion,” Irena explained, “but the Bible says that children should respect their parents and submit to them, and we do. Still, we are allowed to discuss matters together, and each of us has the chance to express our opinion.” When the class was over, everyone was satisfied.</p>

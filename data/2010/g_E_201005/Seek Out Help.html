<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“If somebody could overpower one alone, two together could make a stand against him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:4:12-21:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN we have the support of others, we have a greater chance of success against a foe<wbr />—whoever or whatever that foe may be. So if you want to conquer the smoking habit, you may be wise to look to your family and friends for help<wbr />—or to anyone who will be genuinely supportive and patient.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider seeking out those who have quit the habit themselves, since they may be not only empathetic but also helpful. “The support of others was invaluable to me,” says Torben, a Christian in Denmark. Abraham, who lives in India, writes: “The genuine love shown by my family and fellow Christians helped me to quit.” But sometimes even the support of family and friends is not enough.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I smoked for 27 years,” says a man named Bhagwandas, “but because of learning what the Bible says about unclean habits, I decided to quit. I tried cutting back. I changed my associates. And I went for counseling. Nothing worked. Finally, one night I opened my heart to Jehovah God in prayer and begged him to help me quit. Then, at last, I succeeded!”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc">  Medications to help smokers quit, such as the nicotine patch, have become a multibillion-dollar industry. Before going down that road, consider the following questions:</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se">  <strong>What are the benefits? </strong>Many therapies are said to increase your chances of quitting by reducing withdrawal symptoms. There is some debate, though, about their long-term effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se">  <strong>What are the risks? </strong>Some medications have potential side effects, such as nausea, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind too that nicotine-replacement therapies simply provide another form of the drug, along with its health risks. In reality, therefore, the person using them is still in a state of addiction.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="se">  <strong>What alternatives exist? </strong>In one survey 88 percent of successful quitters said that they went cold turkey by abruptly ceasing tobacco use without the aid of drugs.</p>

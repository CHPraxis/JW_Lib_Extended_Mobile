How Can You Draw Close to God?
The Bible states: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.” (James 4:8) Do you believe that humans can have a warm, intimate relationship with the Creator? Before you can answer that question, though, you need to have truthful answers to questions that are even more fundamental. For example:
Does God exist?
If so, has he communicated with mankind? By what means?
Is the Bible an evidence of that communication? How can we be sure?
These are perhaps the most important questions we could ever ask, and they will be examined in the public talk “How Can You Draw Close to God?” It will be delivered at the “Remain Close to Jehovah!” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses, beginning in May in the United States and continuing around the world.
You are cordially invited to attend the convention nearest you. For specific details, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, or write to the publishers of this magazine. The March 1, 2010, issue of our companion magazine, The Watchtower, and the Web site www.jw.org list convention locations in the United States.

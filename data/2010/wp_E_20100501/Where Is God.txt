Where Is God?
September 11, 2001: At 8:46 a.m., a commercial jet slams into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City—the beginning of a multitarget terrorist attack. Over the next 102 minutes, approximately 3,000 perish.

A 9.0-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean unleashes a series of killer waves that hit 11 countries, including Africa—some 3,000 miles [5,000 km] away. Within a day, 150,000 people are dead or missing, and more than a million are left homeless.
August 1, 2009: A 42-year-old man is jet-skiing with his 5-year-old son when they smash into a wooden dock. The father dies. His son lingers but dies the next day. “We were hoping he would come through and there would be a miracle,” said a distressed relative.
When you read of terrorist attacks or natural disasters or when you experience a personal tragedy, do you wonder if God sees what is happening? Do you wonder if he has left us? The Bible provides a comforting answer, as we will see.

Jesus Gave His Life for Many
Jesus Christ told his followers that he came to earth, “not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matthew 20:28) He willingly gave up his life for the benefit of others.
How did Jesus, by his death, provide a ransom? Why was this necessary? For whom did Jesus lay down his life? And what can his death mean for you?
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to meet with them to examine the Bible’s answers to these questions. This year, the anniversary of Jesus’ death falls on Tuesday, March 30, after sundown. On that occasion, Scriptural answers to the above questions will be presented.
You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.

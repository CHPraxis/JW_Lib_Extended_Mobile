“I Want Out!”

The run-down house shows signs of neglect. Over the years, it has weathered many storms, not all of them successfully. Now the structure is fragile, and the collapse of the house seems imminent.




THAT picture describes the state of many marriages today. Have you ever felt that your own marriage may be heading in the same direction? If so, be assured that no couple is immune to problems. In fact, the Bible realistically acknowledges that those who marry are likely to have “pain and grief.”—1 Corinthians 7:28, The New English Bible.
Underscoring the truthfulness of those words, one team of researchers describe marriage as “the most risky undertaking routinely taken on by the greatest number of people in our society.” They add: “What starts out as a relationship of great joy and promise can become the most frustrating and painful endeavor in a person’s lifetime.”
What about your marriage? Is it characterized by one or more of the following traits?
  Constant arguing

  Bitter speech

  Infidelity

  Resentment


If your marriage seems fragile and its collapse seems imminent, what should you do? Is divorce the answer?



“FROM THE MARGINS TO THE MAINSTREAM”
  In some lands, divorce rates have skyrocketed. Consider the United States, where for many years divorce was relatively uncommon. After 1960, writes Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her book The Divorce Culture, “the rate accelerated at a dazzling pace.” She states: “It doubled in roughly a decade and continued its upward climb until the early 1980s, when it stabilized at the highest level among advanced Western societies. As a consequence of this sharp and sustained rise, divorce moved from the margins to the mainstream of American life in the space of three decades.”

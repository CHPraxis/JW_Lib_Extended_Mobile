“I Need a Word From You”
● The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico received the following letter from a woman who works in a school that gives special attention to the disabled and mentally ill. She wrote: “On May 9, my lovely mom passed away. I can’t describe my feeling of loss. A few months before she died, I did research for my job on the subject of thanatology, the study of death and how to deal with it psychologically. I thought it would help me too, but it didn’t.”
Then, in one of her moments of sorrow, she prayed to God, saying, “I need a word from you.” “That night,” she said, “I read the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. I felt it was written for me. It shows that it is all right to cry. In the section ‘How Can I Live With My Grief?’ it states: ‘Do not underestimate the value of prayer. . . . The help that God supplies does make a difference. . . . True, divine help does not eliminate the pain, but it can make it easier to bear. That does not mean that you will no longer cry or will forget your loved one. But you can recover.’ Those words work.”
If you have lost a loved one in death and feel the need of a comforting word, perhaps you or someone you know will receive comfort from reading the 32-page brochure When Someone You Love Dies.

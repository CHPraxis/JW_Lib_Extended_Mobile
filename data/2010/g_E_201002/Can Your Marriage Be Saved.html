<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Once you have identified your problem and determined the improvements you would like to make, look to the Bible for advice. Its principles are timeless, and they really work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:17-55:3:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:17</a>) For example, the Bible encourages you and your spouse to be forgiving. Indeed, the Bible says that “it is beauty . . . to pass over transgression.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:11-20:19:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Even if at first your efforts seem futile, do not give up! The book <em>The Case for Marriage </em>reports the encouraging results of one study, stating: “The truth is shocking: 86 percent of unhappily married people who stick it out find that, five years later, their marriages are happier.” Even couples who described themselves as very unhappy experienced a turnaround.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Perhaps the same can be true for you. The publishers of this magazine, Jehovah’s Witnesses, have found that the Bible provides practical principles for married couples. For instance, many marriages improve when spouses are kind and tenderly compassionate and freely forgive each other. Wives have learned the value of displaying a “quiet and mild spirit,” and husbands have experienced the benefits of not being bitterly angry with their wives.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">These Scriptural principles are effective because the Bible’s Author, Jehovah God, created the marriage arrangement. Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses for more information on how the Bible can help <em>your </em>marriage?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Closely Examine Scriptural Qualifications</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">1. <strong>Before meeting to consider recommending brothers </strong>as ministerial servants or elders, individual elders should personally review the inspired qualifications found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:1-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Titus 1:5-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:2</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 3:17, 18</a>. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:2001049/14-14"><em>w01 </em>1/15 p. 13 par. 10</a>) Helpful comments on the Scriptural qualifications can be found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005104/">chapters 5</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005105/">6</a> of <em>Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">2. <strong>During the meeting, closely examine the <em>Scriptural qualifications </em></strong>of brothers who may qualify, and make sure that the brother being considered measures up to a reasonable degree. Pray for God’s spirit to guide you. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:2001049/17-17"><em>w01 </em>1/15 p. 14 par. 13</a>) The <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>Governing Body and its representatives rely heavily upon your good judgment and spiritual discernment in making your recommendations.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">3. Natural ability does not qualify a brother for appointment. <strong>He must be a spiritual man, </strong>giving evidence that holy spirit is operating on him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:14-55:1:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 1:14</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="40" href="jwpub://p/E:2001049/15-15"><em>w01 </em>1/15 p. 14 par. 11</a>) Is he zealous for fine works? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Titus 2:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:13-60:3:13" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:13</a>) Is he a good example in his attendance and participation at congregation meetings? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Does he demonstrate a zeal for the ministry? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Is he a student of the Bible? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15</a>) Does he endeavor to help his family spiritually, regularly studying with his wife and his children living at home? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:29-49:5:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 5:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6:4</a>) Does he manifest the fruitage of the spirit in his daily life?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">4. <strong>The congregation expects elders and ministerial servants to take the lead in the ministry. </strong>(<a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005105/9-9"><em>od </em>p. 56 par. 1</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:1991044/13-17"><em>w91 </em>1/15 pp. 12-13</a>) What is the brother’s attitude toward preaching? Is he visible in the ministry? Is he doing all he can in view of his age, health, family obligations, and other theocratic responsibilities? To appoint a brother to a position of responsibility who is not exemplary in the ministry will adversely affect the congregation’s zeal for the ministry.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">5. Though it is the brother who must measure up to the Scriptural qualifications, you should also <strong>consider the spirituality of those in his household. </strong>If his wife is baptized, is she a good example? A wife’s conduct often reflects favorably or unfavorably upon her husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:11-54:3:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:11</a>) If the wife is spiritually weak, he should be doing all that he can to assist her. For instance, is he making Family Worship a priority? He should also have “believing children that [are] not under a charge of debauchery nor unruly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:6-56:1:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Titus 1:6</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010384/30"><em>ks10 </em>3:15</a>.) As a general rule, he should have well-behaved minor children who are <em>“believing.” </em>They <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>should either be progressing toward dedication to God or be already baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Scriptural qualification involves having “children in subjection with all seriousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:4-54:3:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:4</a>) The conduct of <em>adult </em>children still living in the home also reflects upon him.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:1990648/10-10"><em>w90 </em>9/1 p. 25 par. 7;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="32" href="jwpub://p/E:1988166/9-9"> <em>w88 </em>3/1 p. 24 par. 5</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>Cautions Before Recommending Certain Brothers</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">6. Elders should make sure they have full and complete information regarding the brothers they intend to recommend to the circuit overseer<del> and branch office</del>, especially those in the following circumstances.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">7. <strong>Brother previously reproved or disfellowshipped: </strong>When was he reproved or disfellowshipped? What was the offense? In a case of reproof, did the judicial committee make an announcement? If disfellowshipped, what is the date of reinstatement? When were the last restrictions lifted? Was he reproved or disfellowshipped on any other occasions? What convinces you that he has lived down his  past wrongdoing and that others now view him as a good example? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:1990648/8-8"><em>w90 </em>9/1 p. 24 par. 5</a>) If the wrongdoing took place in another congregation, have you communicated with the elders there to determine how that congregation views him? Recommending him prematurely tends to minimize the seriousness of wrongdoing in his own eyes and in the eyes of others. It is also disturbing to those who still have his bad course fresh in their memories.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">8. <strong>Guilty of adultery in the past: </strong>It will likely take longer for him to live down his wrong and gain a good reputation. <em>Before discussing his recommendation with the circuit overseer, </em>you should know the answers to the following questions: When did the adultery occur? Was he reproved or disfellowshipped? In a case of reproof, did the judicial committee make an <span id="page33" class="pageNum" data-no="33" data-before-text="33"></span>announcement? Did the innocent mate reject him? How do you know this? If he divorced, did he remarry? Did he marry the individual with whom he committed adultery? Is there evidence that he schemed to put away his former mate or that he pressured her to accept a divorce? Did the adultery break up the marriage of the other person? How were others affected by his adultery? Is the innocent mate still alive? Did the innocent mate remarry? What convinces you that he has lived down his past wrongdoing and is now viewed with respect? If the wrongdoing took place in another congregation, correspond with the elders there to get their comments on your recommendation.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">9. <strong>Separated or unscripturally divorced: </strong>Who is primarily to blame for the marital problems? What were the circumstances surrounding the separation or divorce? Who is responsible for the separation or pursued the divorce? Did both sign the decree indicating their agreement? How long ago did it occur? What is the brother doing to try to reconcile? Is his mate unwilling to cooperate with his efforts? If so, why? How is his situation viewed by the congregations involved? How do the elders of the mate’s congregation feel about the brother? When separation and divorce are involved, there may be deficiencies on the part of both mates that make it necessary to limit special privileges because neither of them is exemplary.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="33" href="jwpub://p/E:1988807/10-10"><em>w88 </em>11/1 p. 21 par. 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">10. <strong>Brothers who served in an appointed position in the past: </strong>A clear understanding of the reasons for the previous deletion or resignation is necessary before making a recommendation. With what congregation did he previously serve, and when was he deleted? What were the reasons why he stopped serving? What makes his circumstances different now? What progress has he made since his deletion? <span id="page34" class="pageNum" data-no="34" data-before-text="34"></span>Depending on the length of time since his deletion, if he previously served as an elder and his deletion was not the result of gross wrongdoing, it may not be necessary for him to serve first as a ministerial servant. If the removal took place in another congregation, you will need to correspond with the elders in that congregation for details of the situation and to get their view of his possible reappointment.<ins>​—See <span class="ni">April 10, 2012</span>, letter to all bodies of elders regarding pornography.</ins></p>

Return the S-2 form or S-52 appointment letter to the branch office, and provide a complete explanation as to why the appointment should be annulled.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">15. <strong>Members of the brother’s household are involved in serious wrongdoing: </strong><em>The brother’s qualifications should automatically be reviewed if this occurs. </em>If the brother’s wife or children, including adult children living in his home, have serious problems, the body should seek to determine whether the head of the household was negligent. Was he permissive? Was he alert to provide needed direction, anticipating potential problems? Was he conducting a regular family study? Was he giving his family needed time and attention? When he became aware of serious wrongdoing, did he promptly inform the body of elders so that they could properly investigate the matter? Did he shield his family from discipline or try to manipulate the elders’ handling of the situation? Does he continue to have the respect and confidence of the congregation as an exemplary family head? If one of his children was guilty of serious sin, are the other children doing well spiritually? If the brother has done all that can reasonably be expected and especially if he has had spiritual success with others in his household, rejection of his fine direction by one family member would not necessarily disqualify him if he continues to have the respect of the congregation.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1988166/9-12"><em>w88 </em>3/1 p. 24</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1978090/"><em>w78 </em>2/1 pp. 31-32</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1972127/1-12"><em>w72 </em>2/15 p. 126</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">16. <strong>A disfellowshipped or disassociated family member moves back into the home: </strong>This is a <span id="page37" class="pageNum" data-no="37" data-before-text="37"></span>decision for the family head, not the body of elders. However, such a decision may cause many problems. If the brother has allowed a disfellowshipped or disassociated family member to move into his home, the body of elders should review his qualifications. Is the disfellowshipped or disassociated individual unable to live on his own, or has he moved back because it is an easier life? Are there valid reasons for allowing him back in the home, or is it primarily so that the Christian family members can resume a measure of association with him? Did the family avoid unnecessary contact with him when he was living outside the home? Is the arrangement temporary or permanent? What is the disfellowshipped or disassociated individual’s conduct? What spiritual effect is he having on others in the household, especially siblings? Is the congregation disturbed by the brother’s decision? Have a number lost respect for him?​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="46" href="jwpub://p/E:202002285/"><em>km </em>8/02 pp. 3-4</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:1981689/12:447-23"><em>w81 </em>9/15 pp. 28-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">17. <strong>Bankruptcy: </strong>If an elder or a ministerial servant declares bankruptcy, causing members of the congregation or the community to become upset, the elders should review his qualifications. Did the brother lack self-control in his spending or fail to use reasonable foresight in his business decisions? Does he have a reputation for being honest and responsible? Is he viewed as one who conscientiously tries to pay his debts? Does he feel a moral responsibility to repay canceled debts if former creditors would accept payment? Does he still have the respect of the congregation? Does he continue to have “a fine testimony from people on the outside”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:7-54:3:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:7</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="37" href="jwpub://p/E:1994688/"><em>w94 </em>9/15 pp. 30-31</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:1968247/"><em>w68 </em>pp. 223-224</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">18. <strong>Tacit approval of a marriage between a baptized Christian and a person who is not baptized: </strong>An appointed man should be loyal to Jehovah’s standards, including the Scriptural directive to marry “only in the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:15" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:14, <span id="page38" class="pageNum" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:8-56:1:8" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Titus 1:8</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="45" href="jwpub://p/E:2004486/9:207-14"><em>w04 </em>7/1 p. 31</a>) This directive applies to all Christians, even those who are inactive. Questions about a brother’s qualifications would result if he gave tacit approval to a marriage between a baptized Christian and a person who is not baptized. Participating in, supporting, or assisting in the courtship, wedding, or reception implies approval. Questions would also arise if the brother did not get involved personally but allowed his wife or others in his household to do so. If an elder or a ministerial servant displays poor judgment in these areas to a degree that it raises serious questions in the minds of others, he may be Scripturally disqualified from serving.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="44" href="jwpub://p/E:2002324/19-21"><em>w02 </em>5/1 p. 17 pars. 13-15;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="42" href="jwpub://p/E:2001364/22-24$p/E:2001365/1-4:374"> <em>w01 </em>5/15 pp. 20-21 pars. 16-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">19. <strong>If it comes to light or an appointed brother confesses that he has committed a disfellowshipping offense years in the past: </strong>The body of elders may determine he can continue to serve if the following is true: The immorality or other serious wrongdoing occurred more than a few years ago, and he is genuinely repentant, recognizing that he should have come forward immediately when he sinned. (Perhaps he has even confessed to his sin, seeking help with his guilty conscience.) He has been serving faithfully for many years, has evidence of God’s blessing, and has the respect of the congregation.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">20. If the sin occurred before he was appointed as an elder or a ministerial servant, the elders will need to take into consideration the fact that he should have mentioned this possible impediment to his being qualified when elders interviewed him just prior to announcing his appointment. Moreover, the nature of the sin may reflect greatly on his qualifications to serve. For example, the sin may involve past child abuse, and this would likely disqualify him for many years.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:1997003/1-25"><em>w97 </em>1/1 pp. 26-29</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1977847/20-26"><em>w77 </em>pp. 697-698</a>.

If the wrongdoing occurred <em>within the past few years while he was serving </em>as an elder or a ministerial servant, he is disqualified from serving as such, not being “free from accusation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:10-54:3:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:6-56:1:7" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Titus 1:6, 7</a>) Depending on the circumstances, the situation may also need to be handled by a judicial committee.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010386/93-103">5:43-44</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">22. Do not be quick to recommend deletion unless there is a solid basis for doing so. It may be possible to assist the brother so that he can correct the reasons for disqualification and continue to serve. Has the brother served faithfully for many years? What has he done or failed to do that raises questions? How did he react to counsel? Has he had such difficulties in the past, and how did he then respond to efforts to help? Was his wrongdoing really so serious that it requires restricting his privileges? Possibly he just made a mistake, using poor judgment on an occasion. The congregation in general may still have respect for him and confidence in him as an elder or a ministerial servant. Perhaps the matter is not widely known, if at all. If he realizes his action was unwise, has learned from his mistake, has a good attitude, and wants to improve, it may be that he can continue to serve.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">23. <strong>If it is necessary to review an <em>elder’s </em>qualifications, </strong>the body of elders should consider the matter, with the brother in question present, using the following procedure:</p>

In addition, they can be present with the ministerial servants during the meeting the circuit overseer conducts with the appointed servants in the congregation. If the circuit overseer’s outline includes additional information for elders only, recommended elders who have not yet been reappointed can remain as this information is discussed. However, they should not be present when recommendations and local congregation needs are considered. If the brother is not recommended for reappointment either by the previous body of elders or by the new body of elders, he would not be eligible to attend the spiritual programs mentioned above. Brothers who served as elders in their former congregation do not function in an official capacity as elders (such as by serving on judicial committees or attending meetings of the body of elders) in their new congregation until they are reappointed.</p>

One congregation should hold the <em>Congregation’s Publisher Record </em>(S-21) card. Each time he leaves, the elders should write a letter to the congregation where he will be temporarily, explaining his circumstances and how he was being used. The elders of the congregation he is visiting can use him to care for duties and responsibilities in the congregation as outlined above. Even if he will be away for more than three months, he should send his field service reports to his home congregation.</p>

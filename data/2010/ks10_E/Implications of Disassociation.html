<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">1. Whereas disfellowshipping is an action taken by a judicial committee against an unrepentant wrongdoer, disassociation is an action taken by an individual who no longer desires to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:19-62:2:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 2:19</a>) The body of elders should appoint a committee of three elders to consider the facts.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">2. A judicial committee should not continue an investigation into alleged wrongdoing if the accused person makes known his decision to disassociate himself. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="178" href="jwpub://p/E:1984489/1-7"><em>w84 </em>7/1 p. 31</a>) However, at no time should the elders ask the accused if he desires to disassociate himself. If the elders are handling a particularly difficult case and there is a question about whether the person has disassociated himself, it would be best for the committee to contact the branch office for further direction. If an individual is determined to disassociate himself, then the committee would prepare a summary of the alleged offense(s) and the evidence of such. This would be kept along with information regarding the disassociation. If the person later requests reinstatement, these matters would need to be considered with him at that time.<ins>​—See <span class="ni">January 6, 2017</span>, letter to all bodies of elders for further direction on filing confidential material.</ins></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">3. Actions that may indicate disassociation include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su"><span id="page111" class="pageNum" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>  <strong>Making known a firm decision to be known no longer as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </strong>If the individual is agreeable, the committee should first try to speak with him and provide spiritual assistance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>) Does he really desire to disassociate himself, or does he simply no longer want to associate actively with the congregation? Is the desire to disassociate prompted by doubts or discouragement? If he is adamant in his position, he should be encouraged to put his request in writing and sign it. If he does not, then the witnesses to his request should prepare a statement for the confidential files and sign it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">  <strong>Joining another religious organization and making known his intention to remain with it. </strong>If it is learned that a person has taken up association with another religious organization and thus is identified with it, a committee (not judicial) should be selected to investigate matters and endeavor to provide spiritual assistance. If the individual has joined another religious organization and intends to remain with it, he has disassociated himself.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  <strong>Willingly and unrepentantly taking blood. </strong>If someone willingly takes blood, perhaps because of being under extreme pressure, the committee should obtain the facts and determine the individual’s attitude. If he is repentant, the committee would provide spiritual assistance in the spirit of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:22-65:1:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jude 22, 23</a>. Since he is spiritually weak, he would not qualify for special privileges for a period of time, and it may be necessary to remove certain basic privileges. Depending on the circumstances, the committee may also need to arrange for an announcement to the congregation: <strong>“The elders have handled a matter having to do with [name </strong><span id="page112" class="pageNum" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span><strong>of person]. You will be glad to know that spiritual shepherds are endeavoring to render assistance.” </strong>On the other hand, if the elders on the committee determine that he is unrepentant, they should announce his disassociation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  <strong>Taking a course contrary to the neutral position of the Christian congregation. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:17-43:15:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 15:17-19</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="179" href="jwpub://p/E:1999807/"><em>w99 </em>11/1 pp. 28-29</a>) If he joins a nonneutral organization, he has disassociated himself. If his employment makes him a clear accomplice in nonneutral activities, he should generally be allowed a period of time up to six months to make an adjustment. If he does not, he has disassociated himself.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="152" href="jwpub://p/E:201976325/1-41"><em>km </em>9/76 pp. 3-6</a>.<ins>​—See <span class="ni">November 6, 2014</span>, letter to all bodies of elders regarding procedures when legal issues are involved.</ins></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">4. The coordinator of the body of elders should approve the announcement before an elder reads it to the congregation. The announcement should be as follows: <strong>“[Name of person] is no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">5. Since disassociation is an action taken by the publisher rather than the committee, there is no arrangement for an appeal. Therefore, the announcement of disassociation can be made on the occasion of the next Service Meeting without waiting seven days. A report of the disassociation should promptly be sent to the branch office, using the appropriate forms.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010388/60-62">7:33-34</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">1. At times it may be necessary to mark those who display a flagrant disregard for theocratic order though not practicing a grave sin that would result in judicial action. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="204" href="jwpub://p/E:1999527/"><em>w99 </em>7/15 pp. 29-31</a>) This could include such things as being grossly lazy or critical or being a profitless talker who is a constant ‘meddler with what does not concern him.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:11-53:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:11</a>) It may involve one who schemes to take material advantage of others, indulges in entertainment that is clearly improper, or dates when not legally or Scripturally free.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="189" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005113/21:301-29:98"><em>od </em>p. 150-151</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">2. If the disorderly conduct is <em>generally unknown to others </em>and poses no threat to their spiritual well-being, usually it is best to handle things through admonition and counsel. <strong>The elders should not be hasty in giving a warning talk. </strong>However, if the individual does not see the error of his way but continues to be an unwholesome influence, a warning <span id="page125" class="pageNum" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>talk may be given to the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:6-53:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:14-53:3:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="204" href="jwpub://p/E:1999527/"><em>w99 </em>7/15 pp. 29-31</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="198" href="jwpub://p/E:1985290/"><em>w85 </em>4/15 pp. 30-31</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  <strong>Example​—mark for dating an “unbeliever”: </strong>The elders should first counsel and try to help a disorderly one. If a person <em>persists </em>in a way that is disturbing and that has the potential for spreading, they may conclude that there would be reason for a warning talk to be given to the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:11-53:3:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 3:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:14-53:3:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 14</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="205" href="jwpub://p/E:1999527/14-18"><em>w99 </em>7/15 p. 31</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">  It may be that an individual is dating not an actual ‘unbeliever’ but an unbaptized publisher. In such cases a warning talk may not be needed, depending on the circumstances, on the attitude of the Christian, on the level of disturbance to the congregation, and other factors. Nonetheless, if he is dating with a view to marrying someone who is unbaptized, he is not obeying the Bible’s counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a> to marry “only in the Lord,” and loving counsel should be given. Elders will use reasonableness and discernment in determining whether a particular situation is sufficiently serious and disturbing to require a warning talk.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="189" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005113/21:301-29:98"><em>od </em>pp. 150-151;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="207" href="jwpub://p/E:2004486/1-14"> <em>w04 </em>7/1 pp. 30-31</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">3. If the disorderly one becomes ashamed of his ways and is moved to change, then as elders of the congregation see the adjustment, they can individually decide to end the limitation they have put on personally socializing with him. This will indicate to the congregation that he is no longer marked.</p>

<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Weddings</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">4. Elders may perform a wedding of two Christians or of two unbaptized publishers who are progressing toward baptism. If the couple have a specific elder in mind, they can personally ask him to <span id="page126" class="pageNum" data-no="126" data-before-text="126"></span>officiate at their wedding. If the couple have no preference, the body of elders can select one of their number to do this. The elder solemnizing a marriage should make sure that he is legally qualified in the state or locality where the wedding takes place. If the speaker does not legally qualify to administer the vows, another elder who meets such legal requirements could administer the wedding vows after the speaker gives the discourse. The elder who administers the vows would complete the necessary documents. Any elder who is asked to give a wedding talk or administer the vows should conscientiously decide whether he wishes to serve in such capacity. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="203" href="jwpub://p/E:1997285/4:333-7"><em>w97 </em>4/15 p. 24;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="194" href="jwpub://p/E:1984284/16:675-24:391"> <em>w84 </em>4/15 pp. 13-14</a>) Elders should not perform the wedding of two persons who are not seriously involved in the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Neither should the elders be involved, directly or indirectly, in the wedding of a baptized individual to an unbaptized, disassociated, or disfellowshipped person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 7:39</a>) It would be improper to participate in a second wedding years after the initial ceremony, as this would imply that the first wedding was not binding.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="209" href="jwpub://p/E:2006765/11-11"><em>w06 </em>10/15 p. 19 par. 8</a>.<ins> See <span class="ni">October 12, 2010</span>, letter to all bodies of elders regarding wedding procedures and Scriptural freedom to remarry.</ins></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">5. Before agreeing to officiate, an elder should personally speak with the couple and tactfully but straightforwardly <strong>inquire about their conduct during courtship. </strong>Make sure that all involved are familiar with and follow the direction in the articles in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:202008404/">November 2008 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>page 3</a>; the <a class="xt" data-xtid="208" href="jwpub://p/E:2006765/1-5:257$p/E:2006766/$p/E:2006767/">October 15, 2006, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 18-31</a>; the <a class="xt" data-xtid="202" href="jwpub://p/E:1997285/1-15">April 15, 1997, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 23-26</a>; and the <a class="xt" data-xtid="197" href="jwpub://p/E:1984284/5:364-28">April 15, 1984, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 11-15</a>. If it is learned that they have engaged in sexual immorality that requires assistance from a judicial committee, the couple cannot use the Kingdom Hall. If neither is disfellowshipped, it will be up to the discretion of the elder as to whether he will officiate at another location. He may also want to inquire about some of the plans for the wedding and reception and give kindly reminders if needed to help them demonstrate <span id="page127" class="pageNum" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>reasonableness. However, he should remember that what they choose to do is a personal matter as long as this is not unscriptural. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 4:5</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="196" href="jwpub://p/E:1984284/5:364-16:674"><em>w84 </em>4/15 pp. 11-12</a>) The elder should also <strong>make sure that the bride and groom are legally and Scripturally free to marry. </strong>If either was married before, the elder should ask to see a copy of the divorce decree to make sure that the divorce was finalized. He should also be satisfied that the divorce is Scriptural. If the person’s divorce occurred before baptism, the elder should not assume the individual is Scripturally free, as baptism does not dissolve previous marital ties. If either the bride or the groom is from another congregation, the elder should speak or correspond with the elders from that congregation to confirm the person’s standing in the congregation, Scriptural freedom to marry, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">6. <strong>If a couple wishes to use the Kingdom Hall, </strong>they should submit a written request well in advance of the wedding date indicating the specific day and time they desire to use the hall. The Congregation Service Committee should promptly consider the request on behalf of the body of elders. Though it is not a requirement that all in the wedding party be baptized, the wedding party should not include any person whose lifestyle grossly conflicts with Bible principles. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:202008404/"><em>km </em>11/08 p. 3</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="195" href="jwpub://p/E:1984284/24:392-28"><em>w84 </em>4/15 p. 15</a>) Any decoration of the Kingdom Hall or rearrangement of the chairs must be approved. Only music selected from <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>or that is found in our songbook may be used. The elders may permit a rehearsal at the Kingdom Hall as long as it does not interfere with other congregation arrangements.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">7. <strong>The marriage discourse </strong>should reflect dignity, honor, and seriousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 13:4</a>) Its purpose is to impress on the minds of the participants, as well as those observing, the God-given responsibilities that married couples must assume and discharge in full harmony with the Scriptures. It is not appropriate to <span id="page128" class="pageNum" data-no="128" data-before-text="128"></span>tell humorous stories or read poems simply to entertain or amuse the audience. If the branch office provides an outline in the local language, it should be used.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">8. Since much of the direction outlined above has generally been given only to congregation elders, <strong>appointed elders should be used to officiate at weddings, if available. </strong>(<a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:202008404/"><em>km </em>11/08 p. 3</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="194" href="jwpub://p/E:1984284/16:675-24:391"><em>w84 </em>4/15 pp. 13-14</a>) Also, elders are certified teachers of God’s Word, so they are the ones most qualified to highlight the important Scriptural principles that apply on this special occasion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>Scriptural Freedom to Remarry</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">9. <strong>Elders should be very careful </strong>when it comes to giving direction on whether an individual is Scripturally free and should <strong>consult with the branch office </strong>on any questions. This is especially true since the decisions a person makes in such matters will affect not only their relationship with their marriage mate but also their relationship with Jehovah. We therefore as elders shoulder a heavy responsibility in such matters and need to be cautious when offering counsel, especially when the answer may not be readily apparent.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:48-42:12:48" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 12:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:1-59:3:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Jas. 3:1</a>.<ins> See <span class="ni">October 12, 2010</span>, letter to all bodies of elders regarding wedding procedures and Scriptural freedom to remarry.</ins></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">10. Scriptural freedom to remarry requires three conditions: <em>por·neiʹa; </em>a rejection (refusal to reconcile) by the innocent mate; and a legal, final divorce.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:31-40:5:32" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 5:31, 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 19:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Heb. 13:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">11. If a dedicated Christian who accuses his believing mate of adultery and <strong>wishes to establish freedom to divorce and remarry </strong>approaches an elder, the matter should be referred to the body of elders. The accuser is not free unless the evidence establishing wrongdoing is sufficient to warrant the formation of a judicial committee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:15-5:19:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 19:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 8:17</a>) If the accused mate is associated with another congregation, the evidence should be presented to <span id="page129" class="pageNum" data-no="129" data-before-text="129"></span>the elders of that congregation for review and a determination. <em>The publisher should be advised that he is not to view himself as Scripturally free until the elders have investigated and guilt is established.</em></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">12. In some cases adultery is not proved, but it is established by confession or by two or more witnesses that the mate stayed <em>all night </em>in the same house with a person of the opposite sex (or a known homosexual) <em>under improper circumstances. </em>The elders should carefully consider the situation. Were the individuals together <em>all night? </em>Were <em>improper </em>circumstances involved? For example, were the two persons alone? Is there evidence of a romantic relationship? What were the sleeping arrangements? Even if adultery is not established, it may be that the Christian was involved in an immoral sleeping arrangement. Although the elders cannot tell the innocent mate that he is free to marry because adultery was not proved, in view of the circumstances, if the innocent mate is convinced that adultery did occur, the elders may allow him to take responsibility before Jehovah for obtaining a Scriptural divorce; if he remarries, no judicial action will be taken.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">13. Even <strong>if the accused mate is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses </strong>(disfellowshipped, disassociated, or never baptized), two witnesses are also generally required to establish wrongdoing that would provide a basis for Scriptural freedom. An exception may be made, however, if the unbeliever privately makes an <strong>unambiguous confession of adultery </strong>to the Christian mate. In such a case, if the innocent Christian mate believes that the confession is true and does not wish to reconcile, he can submit a letter to the elders outlining his situation. The body of elders should then consider the letter. Is there any known reason to conclude other than that the unbelieving mate has been immoral? For example, was the confession worded ambiguously? Did the unbeliever <span id="page130" class="pageNum" data-no="130" data-before-text="130"></span>later deny making the confession? If the unbeliever is willing to speak with the elders and matters are unclear, the elders may choose to ask the accused mate directly. If there is no known reason to conclude otherwise, the innocent mate can be allowed to take responsibility before Jehovah for obtaining a Scriptural divorce; if he remarries, no judicial action will be taken.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="193" href="jwpub://p/E:1977729/"><em>w77 </em>pp. 607-608</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">14. The following constitutes rejection by the innocent mate:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">  The innocent mate <em>initiates </em>a divorce either before or after learning of the adultery.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su">  The innocent mate <em>signs a divorce decree indicating he does not object </em>to a divorce initiated by the guilty mate, either before or after learning of the adultery. Note: In some lands it is possible for the innocent mate to sign divorce documents that stipulate custody of the children and financial support without indicating he agrees with the divorce; his signing such papers in itself would <em>not </em>indicate a rejection.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="206" href="jwpub://p/E:2000926/1-12"><em>w00 </em>12/15 pp. 28-29</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="su">  Though verbally expressing forgiveness and not seeking a divorce, the innocent mate <em>refuses to resume sexual relations for a very prolonged period of time, </em>a year or even years. Before indicating to the guilty mate that he is free to pursue a Scriptural divorce, the elders should consult with the branch office. Note: The innocent mate is not required to make a quick decision whether to forgive or not.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="192" href="jwpub://p/E:1974808/"><em>w74 </em>pp. 671-672</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">15. If a divorced person remarries and he was not Scripturally free to do so​—in other words, if <em>adultery </em><span class="underline">and </span><em>rejection by the innocent mate </em>had not occurred—​he has entered into an adulterous marriage. <span id="page131" class="pageNum" data-no="131" data-before-text="131"></span>In Jehovah’s eyes, he has married someone while still bound to another. Entering into such a marriage would call for judicial action.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">16. If the disfellowshipped one was eventually reinstated, the elders would be very cautious in extending any special privileges. He could share in the cleaning and repair of the local Kingdom Hall. He may eventually give student talks in the Theocratic Ministry School if his doing so would not disturb others. However, <strong>he would not be assigned to help with literature, accounts, magazines, attendants, or similar privileges in the congregation as long as the innocent former mate is alive, unmarried, and has not been guilty of <em>por·neiʹa.​</em></strong>—<a class="xt" data-xtid="186" href="jwpub://p/E:1983209/8:616-16:278"><em>w83 </em>3/15 p. 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">17. If a Christian did not enter into an adulterous marriage but <strong>deliberately committed adultery in a scheming way so as to end his marriage or he pressured the innocent mate to reject him </strong>and eventually agree to a divorce, he has dealt treacherously with her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:14-39:2:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mal. 2:14-16</a>) His conduct is similar to entering into an adulterous marriage, and he would not qualify for special privileges for <em>many years.</em><ins>​—See <span class="ni">January 6, 2017</span>, letter to all bodies of elders for direction on filing confidential material.</ins></p>

However, there are legal matters over which the congregation does not have authority and which may therefore be taken to a secular court for judgment without violating the principle or the spirit of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:1-46:6:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:1-8</a>. These include:</p>

<li><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="su"><span id="page134" class="pageNum" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>  Obtaining insurance compensation.

<li><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="su">  Being listed among creditors in bankruptcy procedures.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="su">  Probating wills.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="su">  Certain countersuits. For example, if a <em>worldly creditor </em>sues a brother, it might be necessary for the brother, for his own protection, to file a countersuit even though spiritual brothers may be included in the action.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="su">  If a brother takes legal action against another baptized Witness, it would not be a violation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:1-46:6:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:1-8</a> for the one being sued to defend himself or to countersue.

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">24. When the local congregation is affected by a disaster, elders should assist the publishers in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="su">  <strong>Quickly make assessment of the immediate needs of the brothers and sisters. </strong>Group overseers can take the lead to locate each family in their field service group and inquire of their well-being. They will next want to communicate their findings to the coordinator or another elder, if he is not available, even if all is well.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="su">  <strong>Take care of the immediate needs </strong>by arranging for medical treatment and supplies, such as water, food, and shelter.

</li>
<li><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="su">  <strong>Give spiritual and emotional support </strong>to the congregation, and resume congregation meetings as quickly as possible.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="213" href="jwpub://p/E:202007006/"><em>km </em>1/07 p. 4</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="188" href="jwpub://p/E:101996446/1-8"><em>g96 </em>6/22 p. 17</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="su">  In addition to the immediate physical needs of the brothers, is there property damage? Is damage to Kingdom Halls and individual homes major or minor? (For example, major would be roof destroyed, several feet of water in home; minor would be missing shingles on roof, windows broken, and so forth.) To <strong>gather the necessary information, </strong>responsible elders in the area may help in assessing the damage. Once this information is gathered, the coordinator or another elder may <strong>inform the circuit overseer </strong>of the damage and the health condition of the brothers and sisters in the congregation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="su">  When the <strong>circuit overseer </strong>has received the report from the elders, he <strong>will promptly call the branch office. </strong>The branch office will determine whether there is a need for further assistance.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="su">  <strong>Other assistance </strong>may be provided, such as checking to see what government aid may be available.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="190" href="jwpub://p/E:1966088/"><em>w66 </em>2/1 pp. 95-96</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="su">  Do not send materials or supplies to the disaster area unless specifically requested by the brothers in charge. This will assure an orderly relief effort and the proper distribution of goods.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="su">  Please do not telephone the branch office just for information, as this can tie up phone lines that are needed to handle incoming calls from the disaster area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sb">26. <strong>Following a disaster, </strong>the publishers can make good use of opportunities to comfort others spiritually and, to the extent possible, to help in practical ways according to the need. Aiding the brothers in these ways takes time and effort. However, love for the whole association of brothers will prompt us to do what we can to help those in need.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:1-47:8:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:1-12</a>.</p>

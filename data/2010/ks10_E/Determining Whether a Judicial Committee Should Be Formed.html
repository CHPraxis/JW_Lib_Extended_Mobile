There may be other matters that would also merit the attention of a judicial committee. The elders must use good judgment and reasonableness when evaluating the seriousness of the alleged wrongdoing. They should consider the extent and nature of the misconduct, intent and motive, frequency or practice, and so forth. If there is a question about whether certain wrongdoing merits judicial action, the body of elders may write to the branch <span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>office requesting further direction concerning the case.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">8.

Strong’s Greek Dictionary </em>uses very forceful terms to define it: “licentiousness; filth[iness], lasciviousness, wantonness.” <em>The New Thayer’s Greek English Lexicon </em>adds to the list “unbridled lust, . . . outrageousness, shamelessness, insolence.” Another lexicon defines <em>a·selʹgei·a </em>as conduct that “violates all bounds of what is socially acceptable.” Rather than relating to bad conduct of a somewhat petty or minor nature, “brazen conduct” describes acts that reflect an attitude that betrays disrespect, disregard, or even contempt for divine standards, laws, and authority. Therefore, two elements are involved in brazen conduct: (1) The conduct itself is a serious violation of Jehovah’s laws, and (2) the attitude of the wrongdoer toward God’s laws is disrespectful, insolent.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="147" href="jwpub://p/E:2006528/4:307-13:127"><em>w06 </em>7/15 p. 30;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="111" href="jwpub://p/E:1983209/22:415-26"> <em>w83 </em>3/15 p. 31</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:1973686/"><em>w73 </em>pp. 574-576</a>.</p>

They observe the secretary invite him inside at 10 p.m. and continue watching <em>all night </em>until he leaves the home at 7 a.m. When the elders speak to him, he admits that he spent the night alone with his secretary, but he denies that he committed adultery. In such a case, the elders have a basis to take judicial action because there is strong circumstantial evidence of <em>por·neiʹa </em>and there may be elements of brazen conduct.

When one practices uncleanness to a <strong>gross, </strong>or serious, degree, it can be grounds for disfellowshipping from the Christian congregation.

</li>
<li><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sw">A guilty plea entered in court by a Christian as part of a plea bargain, perhaps on the advice of an attorney so as to avoid the possibility of a harsher sentence, would generally not in itself be viewed as an admission of guilt in the congregation.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="su">  If there are two or three <strong>witnesses to the same kind of wrongdoing but each one is witness to a separate incident, </strong>the elders can consider their testimony. While such evidence is acceptable to establish guilt, it is preferable to <span id="page72" class="pageNum" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>have two witnesses to the same occurrence of wrongdoing.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="su">  The <strong>testimony of youths </strong>may be considered; it is up to the elders to determine whether the testimony has the ring of truth.</p>

</ul>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="sb">38. <strong>If wrongdoing has not been established but serious questions have been raised, </strong>the body of elders should <strong>appoint two elders to investigate the matter promptly. </strong>For example, there may be just one witness. If so, it would be loving for the witness first to confront the accused and encourage him to take the initiative to approach the elders. The elders can then allow the accused a few days to approach them. (For the witness by himself to confront the accused may not be advisable in all cases​—for example, if the witness and the accused were involved in sexual immorality together or if the witness was a victim of incest or rape by the accused or is a child and the victim of sexual abuse. Or it may be that the witness is extremely timid.) Whether the witness approaches the accused or not, the two elders appointed should speak with the accused regarding the accusation.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:1997607/8-17"><em>w97 </em>8/15 p. 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">39. <strong>If the accused denies the accusation, </strong>the investigating elders should try to arrange a meeting with him and the accuser together. (Note: If the accusation involves child sexual abuse and the victim is currently a minor, the elders should contact the branch office before arranging a meeting with the child and the alleged abuser.) If the accuser or the accused is unwilling to meet with the elders or if the accused continues to deny the accusation of a single witness and the wrongdoing is not established, the elders will leave matters in Jehovah’s hands.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sb">40. In deciding whether to form a judicial committee or not, the body of elders should consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="su">  Does he still profess to be a Witness?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="su">  Is he generally recognized as a Witness in the congregation or the community?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="su">  Does his conduct continue to affect any other person, such as in some cases of adultery or child abuse?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="su">  Does the person have a measure of contact or association with the congregation so that a leavening, or corrupting, influence exists?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="sb">41. Depending upon length of inactivity and other factors suggested above, elders may determine to hold the matter in abeyance. In such a case, they would make a record of the person’s questionable conduct for the congregation file. When the individual again shows interest in returning to the congregation, they can clarify these matters.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">42. If the sinful conduct is known only to believing family members and no congregation action has been taken, believing relatives will likely determine to curtail family association severely, viewing the relative as bad association.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="118" href="jwpub://p/E:1985525/18-18"><em>w85 </em>7/15 p. 19 par. 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="sb">43. Depending upon the circumstances, the situation may need to be handled by a judicial committee. But if the immorality or other serious wrongdoing occurred more than a few years ago and the individual is genuinely repentant and recognizes that he should have come forward immediately when he sinned, good counsel by elders may be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">44. The body of elders may appoint two elders to gather the facts. Thereafter, the body would determine whether a judicial committee is needed or not, taking into consideration answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="su">  Was the wrongdoing in the distant past?</p>

If the individual is serving as a ministerial servant, elder, or pioneer, his qualifications should be examined<em>. </em>If the body of elders determines that he no longer qualifies, a report should be submitted to the branch office.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010384/34-36">3:19-21</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="sb">46. When dealing with wrongdoers, <strong>the elders should not raise questions about the validity of the individual’s baptism. </strong>If the individual raises the issue, the elders may refer him to the <a class="xt" data-xtid="149" href="jwpub://p/E:2010127/2-5">February 15, 2010, <em>Watchtower, </em>page 22</a>. Further information on rebaptism can be found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:1964126/13-38">February 15, 1964, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 123-126</a>, and the <a class="xt" data-xtid="99" href="jwpub://p/E:1960168/1-6$p/E:1960169/1-9$p/E:1960170/">March 1, 1960, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 159-160</a>. Rebaptism is a personal matter.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="sb">47. At times a wrongdoer will claim that his baptism is not valid and that he feels he is not accountable to a judicial committee because he secretly engaged in wrongdoing shortly before he was baptized. If the elders had been aware of his serious wrongdoing committed just before baptism, likely they would not have approved him for baptism. However, this does not necessarily mean that he did not make a valid dedication. Some individuals make a dedication long before the baptism; others have made a dedication shortly before. The elders are not in a position to read the heart and know for a certainty how Jehovah viewed the person at the time he was baptized. If the elders learn that a baptized individual secretly engaged in serious wrongdoing while he was an unbaptized publisher but the wrongdoing ceased before baptism, they should give counsel and encouragement. <strong>A judicial committee should not be formed for prebaptism wrongdoing. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9-11</a>) However, if the individual resumed serious wrongdoing after baptism, the elders would generally deal with him on the basis of what he has professed to be, a dedicated and baptized Christian, and would meet with him judicially. Thereafter, if he feels he should be rebaptized, this would be a personal decision. However, a person should not get rebaptized simply because he gains improved understanding or appreciation of the truth or some Scriptural doctrine.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="sb"><span id="page76" class="pageNum" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>48. There are rare occasions when it is obvious that the baptism was invalid because serious wrongdoing did not cease before baptism, even for a brief period of time. For example, it may be that at the time of baptism, the individual was <em>living </em>immorally with a member of the opposite or the same sex, was <em>a member </em>of a non-neutral organization, or something similar. If there are questions, the branch office should be consulted.</p>

<h2 id="p109" data-pid="109"><strong>Which Congregation Should Handle the Matter?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sb">49. Bodies of elders should cooperate if there is a question regarding which congregation should handle a case of wrongdoing. Which congregation has the facts? Which congregation can handle the case most effectively? Jurisdiction should not become an issue.</p>
<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="sb">50. If a wrongdoer moves before a case has been concluded, it is usually best for the elders of the original congregation to follow through if possible and if distance permits. They are acquainted with the person and his circumstances. If he has moved a great distance away, the brothers of the original congregation should not insist on handling matters if the wrongdoer says he is unable to return to the congregation for the hearing. In such a case, it may be advisable to refer matters to the elders of the congregation where he now lives. There should be good communication between the two bodies.</p>
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="sb">51. If the elders learn that a publisher who is visiting the area for a short period of time is guilty of wrongdoing, they should promptly report the matter to the elders of his congregation.</p>

<p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="sb">52. If a member of a congregation confesses to wrongdoing that involves a person in another congregation, <span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>the elders should promptly pass along what they know to the elders of the other congregation and allow them time to investigate. Does the other individual admit the wrong? Do their accounts match, or are there significant differences? The judicial committees should communicate freely and cooperate in obtaining the facts. There are <strong>many advantages to interviewing individuals jointly </strong>to ascertain what actually occurred and to clarify discrepancies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Prov. 18:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:17-20:18:17" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 17</a>) If a joint hearing is held, thereafter the judicial committee of each congregation will withdraw and handle the case of the person from its own congregation. <strong>The judicial committee in one congregation should generally not conclude its case before the elders of the other congregation have fully investigated the situation.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="sb">53. The elders should promptly handle a case of serious wrongdoing by an unbaptized publisher. While a judicial committee would not be formed, the elders should select two elders to meet with him, perhaps the ones who approved him as an unbaptized publisher. They should try to readjust him and to determine whether he continues to qualify.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="85" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005113/47-55"><em>od </em>pp. 157-158</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="123" href="jwpub://p/E:1988845/11-30"><em>w88 </em>11/15 pp. 17-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="sb">54. The assigned elders may determine to place certain restrictions on the individual for a time, including not commenting at meetings, giving talks on the Theocratic Ministry School, or sharing in the public ministry.</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="sb">55. If the wrongdoing is widely known or might become widely known later and the wrongdoer is repentant, the two elders should inform the service committee, who will arrange for the following <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>announcement to be made during the Service Meeting: <strong>“A matter involving [name of person] has been handled, and he [she] continues to serve as an unbaptized publisher with the congregation.”</strong></p>
<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="sb">56. There may be reasons for the body of elders to determine that a Scriptural talk about the sort of wrongdoing involved should be given to the congregation a few weeks after the announcement.</p>
<p id="p120" data-pid="120" class="sb">57. If the unbaptized publisher does not respond to the elders’ assistance, thus displaying an unrepentant attitude, the two elders should inform him that he no longer qualifies as an unbaptized publisher. Or if he informs the elders that he no longer desires to be a publisher, they will accept his decision. In either case, the elders will have the following announcement made during the Service Meeting: <strong>“[Name of person] is no longer recognized as an unbaptized publisher.” </strong>Because of his unrepentant wrongdoing, it would be best for a time not to call on him if he raises his hand to comment at meetings.</p>
<p id="p121" data-pid="121" class="sb">58. If the elders see that such a person is a threat to the flock, they can privately warn those endangered. For example, despite the announcement, the wrongdoer might attempt to socialize with youths in the congregation. In that situation, the elders would speak privately to the parents of the endangered ones and maybe to those youths also.</p>
<p id="p122" data-pid="122" class="sb">59. There is <strong>no specific arrangement for an appeal </strong>or a seven-day waiting period before announcing the decision that one is no longer recognized as an unbaptized publisher. If he expresses dissatisfaction with the conclusion, the body of elders should choose two different elders to review the case.</p>
<p id="p123" data-pid="123" class="sb">60. If someone who was previously removed as an unbaptized publisher begins to make progress and wishes once again to share in the ministry, two elders <span id="page79" class="pageNum" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>(perhaps those who met with him earlier) should meet with him to determine his qualifications. If he qualifies, an announcement should be made that he is an unbaptized publisher. There is no need to wait until he reports field service again to make the announcement.</p>
<p id="p124" data-pid="124" class="sb">61. <strong>If the unbaptized publisher is a minor by law, </strong>the two elders should first speak with the Christian parents to discern what occurred, the child’s attitude, and the corrective steps that the parents are taking. If the parents have the situation in hand, the two elders may choose not to meet with the minor but will check with the parents from time to time to offer helpful counsel, specific suggestions, and loving encouragement.</p>
<p id="p125" data-pid="125" class="sb">62. When an unbaptized publisher is involved in wrongdoing, the two elders assigned to meet with him should prepare a written record of the case. The secretary files this record in the same manner as he files judicial cases.<ins>​—See <span class="ni">January 6, 2017</span>, letter to all bodies of elders for further direction on filing confidential material.</ins></p>

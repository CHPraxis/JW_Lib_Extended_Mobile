<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Elders’ Meetings</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">2. The body of elders is a Scriptural entity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:23-44:14:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 14:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 20:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Titus 1:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:19-46:12:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:19, 20</a>) When the body of elders discusses a matter, <strong>Christ, by means of the holy spirit, can influence any elder </strong>to make an expression that results in a wise decision, one that may not have been reached if the elders had been consulted individually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:6-44:15:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 15:6-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">3. <strong>When to hold elders’ meetings: </strong>Normally the body of elders holds four meetings a year. In addition to the two meetings held in conjunction with the visits of the circuit overseer, they should schedule another meeting about three months after each visit. The body of elders can arrange other meetings any time that circumstances necessitate. Limit additional meetings to their purpose and objectives. Endeavor to keep comments succinct and relevant to the matter under consideration. Unnecessary meetings, or unduly lengthy meetings, consume valuable time that the elders can better spend with their families, in the ministry, and in shepherding. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:4-54:3:4" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:2</a>) Before compiling an agenda, the coordinator of the body of elders should contact the other elders individually for their input to determine what matters they would like to discuss. The circuit overseer compiles the agenda for the meeting held during his visit. In addition to points he himself puts on the agenda, the circuit overseer should contact the coordinator for any input from the body of <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>elders. Meetings should normally not exceed two hours in length.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">4. While it is not wrong for an elder to contact the branch office if he feels the need, it is generally best to discuss matters as a body first. Then, if necessary, <em>write </em>to the branch office. If there is a truly urgent matter requiring assistance from the branch office, it is best for <em>two </em>elders to call together to explain the situation and to make a note of the direction given.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">5. <strong>Suggested matters to include on the agenda for elders’ meetings: </strong>Spiritual matters should be of principal concern. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Phil. 1:9-11</a>) Elders can obtain appropriate ideas regarding matters to discuss by considering the counsel found in the letters to Timothy and Titus and in such passages as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 20:17-35 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:1-11</a>. If necessary, elders can allow time on the agenda for matters of a mechanical, nonspiritual nature. These items would include problems that an individual elder, the Congregation Service Committee, or the operating committee cannot resolve separately. The coordinator of the body of elders should give a copy of the agenda to each elder far enough in advance of the meeting to allow time to do research and to give prayerful thought to what will be discussed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">6. The coordinator should set the pace of the discussion by sticking to the agenda as much as possible and by keeping the main points to the fore. By concluding each matter before opening another, he can ensure that the meeting flows smoothly. The secretary or another designated elder should take notes of the decisions and indicate who will follow through and the time schedule for completion. In some cases the coordinator may ask the elder recommending an item for the agenda to take the lead in presenting it for discussion.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">7. Elders’ meetings will be more productive if brothers speak up, using “freeness of speech.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:13-54:3:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Tim. <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>3:13</a>) The coordinator should avoid dominating the discussion, being careful as to when and how he expresses himself. There should be no wrath or debates evident in elders’ meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:8-54:2:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:8</a>) Speak on the points under discussion only when you have something meaningful to add.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">8. <strong>It should be possible for bodies of elders to be unanimous in most of their decisions. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:25-44:15:25" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 15:25</a>) The body of elders should always base their decisions on Bible principles and written direction from “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) In cases that do not involve specific Bible laws or where there is no direction from the faithful slave, the body of elders must exercise their collective judgment and conscience. First, have the best interests of the entire congregation in mind, and second, consider what may spiritually assist any individual involved.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">9. During the discussion, no one should insist on his personal viewpoint. <strong>If a decision is not unanimous, the minority should give willing support to the final decision. </strong>If in the opinion of the minority a Bible-based decision still has not been reached, the minority should continue to cooperate with the rest of the body and bring the matter to the attention of the circuit overseer during his regular visit. If the matter is urgent, write to the branch office.</p>

<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>How the Body of Elders Is Organized</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">10. The body should be well-organized to care for the needs of the congregation. All the elders should know their respective responsibilities. Just as individual members of the human body carry out certain functions without direct participation by other body members, individual elders have certain latitude to make decisions so as to carry out their respective responsibilities. <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:12-46:12:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:12-31</a>) Certain essential assignments in each congregation are outlined below.</p>

The overseer can ask the ministerial servant in advance to be prepared to share a scripture or a thought from a publication, relate an encouraging experience, or offer prayer.

Periodically reviews with his assistant the record cards of those in his group to determine their strengths and weaknesses in the ministry. (If the assistant is not an elder or a ministerial servant, then the overseer orally shares information with him, noting areas of concern.) Regularly arranges to work in the ministry with each one to provide encouragement and training in all aspects of the work. Assists in the collection of monthly field service reports.

<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="sb">27. Each body of elders is made up of imperfect men with different backgrounds and personalities. If these factors are allowed to cause strained relations, the free flow of Jehovah’s spirit can be restricted and the congregation may be adversely affected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:16-59:3:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Jas. 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:18-59:3:18" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 18</a>) You must therefore work hard to <strong>pursue peace </strong>with your fellow elders.

(<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1200003409/"><em>it</em>-2 p. 591</a>) Thus, elders should <strong>cultivate and maintain friendships with one another, </strong>not merely tolerate one another.</p>
<p id="p120" data-pid="120" class="sb">28.

It does not keep account of the injury. . . .

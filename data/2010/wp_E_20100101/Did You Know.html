<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>What road did the apostle Paul travel during his first journey to Rome?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:28:13-44:28:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 28:13-16</a> states that the ship on which Paul sailed to Italy arrived at Puteoli (modern-day Pozzuoli), on the Bay of Naples. He then traveled to Rome on the Via Appia, the city’s main highway.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Via Appia was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman statesman who began building it in 312 B.C.E. This road, some 18 to 20 feet <strong>[5-6 m] </strong>wide and paved with large blocks of volcanic rock, eventually extended 362 miles <strong>[583 km] </strong>southeast from Rome. It linked Rome with the port of Brundisium (modern Brindisi), the gateway to the East. Wayfarers broke their journey at stopover points<wbr />—spaced 15 or so miles <strong>[24 km] </strong>apart—<wbr />to buy supplies, to sleep, or to change horses or vehicles.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Paul, however, was probably walking. The section of the Via Appia he traveled was 132 miles <strong>[212 km] </strong>long. Part of this stretch crossed the Pontine Marshes, a swampy area that caused one Roman writer to complain about the mosquitoes and foul smell. Just north of those marshes were the Marketplace of Appius<wbr />—about 40 miles <strong>[65 km] </strong>from Rome—<wbr />and Three Taverns, a rest stop some 30 miles <strong>[50 km] </strong>from the city. At these two stops, Christians from Rome were waiting for Paul. Upon seeing them, “Paul thanked God and took courage.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:28:15-44:28:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 28:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>What kind of writing tablet is referred to at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:63-42:1:63" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 1:63</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>Luke’s Gospel records that friends of Zechariah inquired of him what his newborn son was to be named. Zechariah “asked for a tablet and wrote: ‘John is its name.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:63-42:1:63" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:63</a>) According to one scholarly work, the Greek term here rendered “tablet” refers to “a small writing tablet normally made of wood with a prepared wax surface.” Shallow recesses in hinged wooden panels were overlaid with smooth beeswax. Using a stylus, a writer could make notes on this surface. The writing could thereafter be erased and the newly smoothed surface be reused.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The book <em>Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus </em>says: “Paintings from Pompeii, sculptures from various parts of the Roman Empire and actual examples dug up at many sites scattered from Egypt to Hadrian’s Wall [Northern Britain] display the widespread use of the tablets.” A variety of individuals may have had such tablets at hand<wbr />—traders, government officials, and perhaps even some of the first-century Christians.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the month of July, 669,568 Bible studies were conducted in the United States, which no doubt contributed to the baptism of 6,906 individuals. Thus far in the 2010 service year, 4.3 million more hours have been devoted to the ministry than in the same period of the previous service year. The Turks and Caicos Islands had their second consecutive all-time peak, with 256 publishers. This is a 12.8 percent increase over the previous service year. Truly, Jehovah’s people are “zealous for fine works”!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 2:14</a>.</p>

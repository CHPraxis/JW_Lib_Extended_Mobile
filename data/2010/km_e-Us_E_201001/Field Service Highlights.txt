Field Service Highlights
We are happy to report a new peak in regular pioneers in the United States. The total of 126,998 reporting in September 2009 is an increase of 7,890 over the previous peak in December 2008. Also, we are happy to report two new peaks in the Turks and Caicos Islands for September 2009. On average, they are conducting 2.4 Bible studies per publisher for a new peak of 591. In addition, the 31 regular pioneers reporting represent 13 percent of the publishers. It is also encouraging to report that in Bermuda 15.9 percent of the publishers are serving as regular pioneers.

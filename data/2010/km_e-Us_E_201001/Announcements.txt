Announcements
▪ Literature offer for January: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book published prior to 1992. February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? Publishers may also offer The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Publishers should have in mind starting a Bible study when this publication is placed or if a copy is already in the home. April: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing What Does the Bible Really Teach? The objective is to start a Bible study.
▪ Starting in February, the new public talk for the circuit overseers will be “What God’s Kingdom Is Doing for Us Now.”
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning on Friday, May 7, 2010. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on this day. As a reminder, tours of Bethel are no longer available on Saturdays.

Am I Qualified to Preach?
 1. Why should we not feel inadequate about our qualifications to preach?
1 If you ever find yourself asking such a question, take heart! It is neither formal education nor outstanding natural ability that qualifies us as ministers. Some of the early disciples were described as being “unlettered and ordinary.” Nonetheless, they were effective preachers of the good news because they set their hearts to follow the example set by Jesus.—Acts 4:13; 1 Pet. 2:21.
 2. What were some characteristics of Jesus’ teaching?
2 How Jesus Taught: His teaching was simple, down-to-earth, and easy to understand. His questions, illustrations, and uncomplicated introductions captured the listeners’ attention. (Matt. 6:26) He showed sincere interest in people. (Matt. 14:14) Furthermore, Jesus spoke with confidence and authority, knowing that Jehovah had commissioned him and empowered him to carry out his assignment.—Luke 4:18.
 3. How does Jehovah help us to accomplish our ministry?
3 Jehovah Helps Us: Through his Word and organization, our Grand Instructor provides the training we need to preach the good news successfully. (Isa. 54:13) Because Jehovah preserved a record of the way Jesus taught, we are able to analyze and imitate his methods. Jehovah gives us his holy spirit and trains us through congregation meetings. (John 14:26) In addition, he provides experienced publishers who can help us to become more effective.
 4. Why do we have reason to feel qualified to share the good news with others?
4 We have every reason to feel qualified to preach, since “our being adequately qualified issues from God.” (2 Cor. 3:5) As we rely on Jehovah and faithfully make good use of his loving provisions, we will “be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—2 Tim. 3:17.

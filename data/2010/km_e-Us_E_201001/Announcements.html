<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>If householders already have the book, publishers may offer any 192-page book published prior to 1992. <strong>February: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>Publishers may also offer <em>The Bible<wbr /></em>—<em>God’s Word or Man’s? </em>or <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Publishers should have in mind starting a Bible study when this publication is placed or if a copy is already in the home. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>The objective is to start a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, the new public talk for the circuit overseers will be “What God’s Kingdom Is Doing for Us Now.”</p>

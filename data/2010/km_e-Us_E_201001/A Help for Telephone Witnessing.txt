A Help for Telephone Witnessing




While we properly give priority to the house-to-house method of preaching, telephone witnessing is an effective way to spread the good news in a congregation’s assigned territory, especially where there are many homes to which we cannot gain access.—Luke 10:5-7; Acts 5:42; 20:20.
This feature of the ministry can be encouraging to brothers and sisters who are limited in mobility and spend much of their time at home. Publishers will enjoy an interchange of encouragement when they arrange to share in this form of witnessing with these faithful ones. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Also, during inclement weather, publishers may choose to participate in telephone witnessing. Generally speaking, groups should be kept small so that all make the best use of time.
A helpful work sheet is provided on pages 5-6 for use when witnessing by telephone. Space is provided to add presentations that are effective in your territory or that you feel more comfortable using. Feel free to photocopy the work sheet and write on the copy rather than on the original. You may find it helpful to sit at a table and have the work sheet in front of you.

TELEPHONE WITNESSING WORK SHEET
KEEP THESE POINTS IN MIND:
            Relax. Be yourself. Demonstrate courteousness, patience, and friendliness.

            Speak slowly, deliberately, and with sufficient volume.

            Smile and gesture as if the person can see you.

            Avoid unnecessary pauses.

            Allow the householder to share in the conversation, and thank him for his expressions.

            If you are asked a question, repeat it out loud so that your partner can help you find the answer in the Bible, Reasoning book, or another publication. (It is usually better not to put the caller on a speakerphone.)

            Do not mention the donation arrangement, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation. At an appropriate time after you have met the householder face-to-face, you may inform him that our work is supported entirely by voluntary donations.

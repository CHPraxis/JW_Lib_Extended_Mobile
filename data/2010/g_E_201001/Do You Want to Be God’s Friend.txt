Do You Want to Be God’s Friend?
● How would you answer the above question? A young girl in an isolated region of the state of Guerrero, Mexico, said she didn’t think it was possible. Two girls who are Jehovah’s Witnesses were showing her the brochure You Can Be God’s Friend! in her native tongue. She was amazed that it was available in Tlapanec, since she had seen only government publications in her language.
The two girls explained that this very publication was evidence of the Creator’s love for her because through it she could come to know him. She eagerly began reading the first lesson, entitled “God Invites You to Become His Friend.” After she finished it, she said: “I want to be God’s friend. Can you get me a Bible?” When the Witnesses returned with a Bible, the girl’s mother asked them to stay and teach them more.
Tlapanec is just one of the 17 Indian languages in Mexico in which the brochure You Can Be God’s Friend! is printed. Worldwide, it is available in 278 languages (including Braille).

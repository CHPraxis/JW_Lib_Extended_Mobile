<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“The time left is reduced.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:29-46:7:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“JUMPING around and splashing in the water doesn’t mean you’re swimming,” writes Michael LeBoeuf in his book <em>Working Smart.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In other words, there can be a difference between just being active and really accomplishing something worthwhile. Look back at the past week. For what did you make time? For what were you too busy? Do you see a need to make more time for the things you really care about?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider what Jesus foretold about our hurried times. He said that as this system nears its end and God’s righteous new world draws near, his disciples would be busy. Doing what? Preaching “this good news of [God’s] kingdom.” Jesus also said that the majority of people would be <em>too busy to listen. </em>They would be preoccupied with the ordinary matters of life. He added that those who are too busy to take note of the Kingdom message would suffer destruction.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 37-39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:28-42:17:30" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Luke 17:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom in more than 230 lands. True to Jesus’ prediction, many turn them away, stating that they are “too busy.” But we invite you to take time out of your busy life to examine what the Bible teaches about God’s Kingdom. It is our hope that upon learning of the blessings God has in store for mankind, you will agree that hearing and heeding the Bible’s message is something that is worth making time for, something that really matters.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

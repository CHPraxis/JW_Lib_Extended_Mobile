<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Darwin thought that all life might be traced to a common ancestor. He imagined that the history of life on earth resembled a grand tree. Later, others believed that this “tree of life” started as a single trunk with the first simple cells. New species branched from the trunk and continued to divide into limbs, or families of plants and animals, and then into twigs, all the species within the families of plants and animals alive today. Is that really what happened?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong><em>What do many scientists claim? </em></strong>Many give the impression that the fossil record supports the theory of a common origin for life. They also claim that because all living things use similar “computer language,” or DNA, that all life must have evolved from a common ancestor.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong><em>What does the Bible say? </em></strong>The Genesis account states that plants, sea creatures, land animals, and birds were created “according to their kinds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:12-1:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20-25</a>) This description allows for variation within a “kind,” but it implies that there are fixed barriers separating the different kinds. The Bible account of creation also leads us to expect that new types of creatures would appear in the fossil record suddenly and fully formed.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In recent years, scientists have been able to compare the genetic codes of dozens of different single-celled organisms as well as those of plants and animals. They assumed that such comparisons would confirm the branching “tree of life” proposed by Darwin. However, this has not been the case.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What has the research uncovered? In 1999 biologist Malcolm S. Gordon wrote: “Life appears to have had many origins. The base of the universal tree of life appears not to have been a single root.” Is there evidence that all the major branches of life are connected to a single trunk, as Darwin believed? Gordon continues: “The traditional version of the theory of common descent apparently does <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>not apply to kingdoms as presently recognized. It probably does not apply to many, if not all, phyla, and possibly also not to many classes within the phyla.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/40-40"><sup>29</sup><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></a></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Recent research continues to contradict Darwin’s theory of common descent. For example, in 2009 an article in <em>New Scientist </em>magazine quoted evolutionary scientist Eric Bapteste as saying: “We have no evidence at all that the tree of life is a reality.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/41-41"><sup>30</sup></a> The same article quotes evolutionary biologist Michael Rose as saying: “The tree of life is being politely buried, we all know that. What’s less accepted is that our whole fundamental view of biology needs to change.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/42-42"><sup>31</sup><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></a></p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>WHAT ABOUT THE FOSSIL RECORD?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Many scientists point to the fossil record as support for the idea that life emerged from a common origin. They argue, for example, that the fossil record documents the notion that fish became amphibians and reptiles became mammals. What, though, does the fossil evidence really show?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Instead of finding the gradual unfolding of life,” says evolutionary paleontologist David M. Raup, “what geologists of Darwin’s time, and geologists of the present day actually find is a highly uneven or jerky record; that is, species appear in the sequence very suddenly, show little or no change during their existence in the record, then abruptly go out of the record.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/43-43"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In reality, the vast majority of fossils show stability among types of creatures over extensive amounts of time. The evidence does not show them evolving from one type into another. Unique body plans appear suddenly. New features appear suddenly. For example, bats with sonar and echolocation systems appear with no obvious link to a more primitive ancestor.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In fact, more than half of all the major divisions of animal life seem to have appeared in a relatively short period of time. Because many new and distinct life forms appear so suddenly in the fossil record, paleontologists refer to this period as “the Cambrian explosion.” When was the Cambrian period?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Let us assume that the estimates of researchers are accurate. In that case, the history of the earth could be represented by a time line that stretches the length of a soccer field <strong>(1)</strong>. At that scale, you would have to walk about seven eighths of the way down the field before you would come to what paleontologists call the Cambrian period <strong>(2)</strong>. During a small segment of that period, the major divisions of animal life show up in the fossil record. How suddenly do they appear? As you walk down the soccer field, all those different creatures pop up in the space of less than one step!</p>

</div>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The relatively sudden appearance of these diverse life forms is causing some evolutionary researchers to question the traditional version of Darwin’s theory. <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>For example, in an interview in 2008, evolutionary biologist Stuart Newman discussed the need for a new theory of evolution that could explain the sudden appearance of novel forms of life. He said: “The Darwinian mechanism that’s used to explain all evolutionary change will be relegated, I believe, to being just one of several mechanisms​—maybe not even the most important when it comes to understanding macroevolution, the evolution of major transitions in body type.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/44-44"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">What, though, of the fossils that are used to show fish changing into amphibians, and reptiles into mammals? Do they provide solid proof of evolution in action? Upon closer inspection, several problems become obvious.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">First, the comparative size of the creatures placed in the reptile-to-mammal sequence is sometimes misrepresented in textbooks. Rather than being similar in size, some creatures in the series are huge, while others are small.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">A second, more serious challenge is the lack of proof that those creatures are somehow related. Specimens placed in the series are often separated by what researchers estimate to be millions of years. Regarding the time spans that separate many of these fossils, zoologist Henry Gee says: “The intervals of time that separate the fossils are so huge that we cannot say anything definite about their possible connection through ancestry and descent.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/45-45"><sup>34</sup><span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></a></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Commenting on the fossils of fish and amphibians, biologist Malcolm S. Gordon states that the fossils found represent only a small, “possibly quite unrepresentative, sample <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>of the biodiversity that existed in these groups at those times.” He further says: “There is no way of knowing to what extent, if at all, those specific organisms were relevant to later developments, or what their relationships might have been to each other.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/46-46"><sup>35</sup><span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></a></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">An article published in <em>National Geographic </em>in 2004 likened the fossil record to “a film of evolution from which 999 of every 1,000 frames have been lost on the cutting-room floor.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/47-47"><sup>36</sup></a> Consider the implications of that illustration.</p>

<div class="figcaption">
<figcaption>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sr">If “95 frames” of the fossil record show that animals do not evolve from one type into another, why do paleontologists arrange the remaining “5 frames” to imply that they do?</p>
</figcaption>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Imagine that you found 100 frames of a feature film that originally had 100,000 frames. How would you determine the plot of the movie? You might have a preconceived idea, but what if only 5 of the 100 frames you found could be organized to support your preferred plot, while the other 95 frames tell a very different story? Would it be reasonable to assert that your preconceived idea of the movie was right because of the five frames? Could it be that you placed the five frames in the order you did because it suited your theory? Would it not be more reasonable to allow the other 95 frames to influence your opinion?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">How does that illustration relate to the way evolutionists view the fossil record? For years, researchers did not acknowledge that the vast majority of fossils​—the 95 frames of the movie—​showed that species change very little over time. Why the silence about such important evidence? Author Richard Morris says: “Apparently paleontologists had adopted the orthodox idea of gradual evolutionary change and had held onto it, even when they discovered evidence to the contrary. They <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>had been trying to interpret fossil evidence in terms of accepted evolutionary ideas.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/48-48"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<div class="blockTxt rule"><div class="boxContent"><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sc">“To take a line of fossils and claim that they represent a lineage is not a scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime story​—amusing, perhaps even instructive, but not scientific.”​—<em>In Search of Deep Time—​Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life, </em>by Henry Gee, pp. 116-117</p>

</div>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">What about evolutionists today?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn"><strong><em>What do you think? </em></strong>Which conclusion fits the evidence best? Consider the facts we have discussed so far.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">  The first life on earth was not “simple.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su">  The odds against even the components of a cell arising by chance are astronomical.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">In light of these facts, do you think it is reasonable to conclude that the evidence is in harmony with the Bible’s explanation of the origin of life?

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p35" data-pid="35">The biological term phyla (singular, phylum) refers to a large group of animals that have the same distinctive body plan. One way that scientists classify all living things is by a seven-step system in which each step is more specific than the one before it. Step one is kingdom, the broadest category. Then come the categories phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. For example, the horse is categorized in the following way: kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Chordata; class, Mammalia; order, Perissodactyla; family, Equidae; genus, <em>Equus</em>; species, <em>Caballus.</em></p></div>

<h3 id="p51" data-pid="51"><strong>WHAT THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE ACTUALLY SHOWS</strong></h3>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sn"><strong>Fact: </strong>At the beginning of the 20th century, all the fossils that were used to support the theory that humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor could fit on a billiard table. Since then, the number of fossils used to support that theory has increased. Now it is claimed that they would fill a railroad boxcar.<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/50-50"><sup>38</sup></a> However, the vast majority of those fossils consist only of single bones and isolated teeth. Complete skulls​—let alone complete skeletons—​are rare.<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/51-54"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sn"><strong>Question: </strong>Has the increased number of fossils attributed to the human “family tree” settled the question among evolutionary experts as to when and how humans evolved from apelike creatures?</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sn"><strong>Answer: </strong>No. In fact, the opposite is true. When it comes to how these fossils should be classified, Robin Derricourt of the University of New South Wales, Australia, wrote in 2009: “Perhaps the only consensus now is that there is no consensus.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/55-55"><sup>40</sup></a> In 2007 the science journal <em>Nature </em>published an article by the discoverers of another claimed link in the evolutionary tree, saying that nothing is known about when or how the human line actually emerged from that of apes.<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/56-56"><sup>41</sup></a> Gyula Gyenis, a researcher at the Department of Biological Anthropology, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary, wrote in 2002: “The classification and the evolutionary place of hominid fossils has been under constant debate.”<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span> This author also states that the fossil evidence gathered so far brings us no closer to knowing exactly when, where, or how humans evolved from apelike creatures.<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/57-57"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="p55" data-pid="55"><strong>ANNOUNCEMENTS OF “MISSING LINKS”</strong></h3>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sn"><strong>Fact: </strong>The media often widely broadcasts the announcement that a new “missing link” has been discovered. For example, in 2009 a fossil dubbed Ida was unveiled with what one journal called “rock-star hype.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/58-58"><sup>43</sup></a> Publicity included this headline in <em>The Guardian </em>newspaper of the United Kingdom (UK): “Fossil Ida: Extraordinary Find Is ‘Missing Link’ in Human Evolution.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/59-59"><sup>44</sup></a> However, just days later, the UK science journal <em>New Scientist </em>said: “Ida is not a ‘missing link’ in human evolution.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/60-60"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sn"><strong>Question: </strong>Why is each unveiling of a new “missing link” given wide media attention, whereas the removal of that fossil from the “family tree” is hardly mentioned?</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sn"><span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span><strong>Answer: </strong>Regarding those who make these discoveries, Robin Derricourt, quoted earlier, says: “The leader of a research team may need to over-emphasize the uniqueness and drama of a ‘discovery’ in order to attract research funding from outside the conventional academic sources, and they will certainly be encouraged in this by the print and electronic media, looking for a dramatic story.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/61-61"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="p59" data-pid="59"><strong>TEXTBOOK DRAWINGS AND MODELS OF APE-MEN</strong></h3>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sn"><strong>Fact: </strong>Depictions in textbooks and museums of the so-called ancestors of humans are often shown with specific facial features, skin color, and amount of hair. These depictions usually show the older “ancestors” with monkeylike features and the ones supposedly closer to humans with more humanlike facial features, skin tone, and hair.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sn"><strong>Question: </strong>Can scientists reliably reconstruct such features based on the fossilized remains that they find?</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sn"><strong>Answer: </strong>No. In 2003, forensics expert Carl N. Stephan, who works at the Department of Anatomical Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Australia, wrote: “The faces of earlier human ancestors cannot be objectively constructed or tested.” He says that attempts to do so based on modern apes “are likely to be heavily biased, grossly inaccurate, and invalid.” His conclusion? “Any facial ‘reconstructions’ of earlier hominids are likely to be misleading.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/62-62"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sn"><strong>Fact: </strong>The brain size of a presumed ancestor of humans is one of the main ways by which evolutionists determine how closely or distantly the creature is supposed to be related to humans.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sn"><strong>Question: </strong>Is brain size a reliable indicator of intelligence?</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sn"><strong>Answer: </strong>No. One group of researchers who used brain size to speculate which extinct creatures were more closely related to man admitted that in doing so they “often feel on shaky ground.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/63-63"><sup>48</sup></a> Why? Consider the statement made in 2008 in <em>Scientific American Mind: </em>“Scientists have failed to find a correlation between absolute or relative brain size and acumen among humans and other animal species. Neither have they been able to discern a parallel between wits and the size or existence of specific regions of the brain, excepting perhaps Broca’s area, which governs speech in people.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/64-64"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sn"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Why do scientists line up the fossils used in the “ape-to-man” chain according to brain size when it is known that brain size is not a reliable measure of intelligence? Are they forcing the evidence to fit their theory? And why are researchers constantly debating which fossils should be included in the human “family tree”? Could it be that the fossils they study are just what they appear to be, extinct forms of apes?</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="se">What, though, about the humanlike fossils of the so-called Neanderthals, often portrayed as proof that a type of ape-man existed? Researchers are beginning to alter their view of what these actually were. In 2009, Milford H. Wolpoff wrote in the <em>American Journal of Physical Anthropology </em>that “Neandertals may have been a true human race.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102010348/65-65"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● </strong>A mother in her 30’s, who lives with her husband and three children in Kentucky, U.S.A., wrote, “My family and I have enjoyed everything we have that was published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.” She explained: “My favorite for my children is <em>My Book of Bible Stories,” </em>adding, “I was actually able to learn as they did.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This book is attractively illustrated and covers Biblical events in chronological order. For example: Part 2 includes the stories <a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978080/1-9">“A Bad King Rules Egypt,”</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978081/1-12"> “How Baby Moses Was Saved,”</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978082/1-11"> “Why Moses Ran Away,”</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978084/1-11"> “Moses and Aaron See Pharaoh,”</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978085/1-14"> “The 10 Plagues,”</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978086/1-15">“Crossing the Red Sea.”</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Part 6 of the book, entitled <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978140/1-6">“Birth of Jesus to His Death,”</a> has several stories that relate the life of Jesus from his birth to his death. Included are <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978142/1-9">“Jesus Born in a Stable”</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1101978143/1-11">“Men Guided by a Star.”</a> The latter shows that “wise men”<wbr />—actually astrologers—<wbr />came <em>“into the house” </em>to visit Jesus, not to the stable where he was born. In the house they “saw the young child with Mary his mother.” These men were warned by God not to return to Herod, who was seeking to kill Jesus. What should that tell us about who was responsible for the so-called star?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:1-40:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:11-40:2:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>King James Version.</em></p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 1. How did Jehovah deal with Abraham’s descendants, and why does this not mean that he totally disregarded all other people?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH loved Abraham, so He showed loyal love to Abraham’s descendants. For over 15 centuries, he viewed the nation of Israel, which descended from Abraham, as his chosen people, his “special property.” (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Deuteronomy 7:6</em></a><em>.</em>) Did that mean that Jehovah totally disregarded people of other nations? No. During that time, non-Israelites who desired to worship Jehovah were allowed to attach themselves to his special nation. These converts, or proselytes, were viewed as part of the nation. They were to be treated as brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:33-3:19:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 19:33, 34</a>) And they were required to obey all of Jehovah’s laws.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:24:22-3:24:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lev. 24:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>However, Jesus made this startling declaration to the Jews of his day: “The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 21:43</a>) Who would make up this new nation, and how are we today affected by this change?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>The New Nation</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">3, 4. (a) How did the apostle Peter identify the new nation? (b) Who make up this new nation?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The apostle Peter clearly identified this new nation. He wrote the following to his fellow Christians: “You are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies’ of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9</a>) As foretold, natural Jews who accepted Jesus as the Messiah were the first members of that new nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:27-27:9:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 9:27a;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:6-40:10:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:6</a>) Later, many non-Israelites were also included in this nation, for Peter went on to say: “You were once not a people, but are now God’s people.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:10-60:2:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>To whom was Peter here speaking? In the beginning of his letter, he says: “[God] gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3, 4</a>) So this new nation is made up of anointed Christians, who have the heavenly hope. They are “the Israel of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>) In a vision, the apostle John saw that these spiritual Israelites number 144,000. They are “bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb” to serve as “priests” and to “rule as kings with [Jesus] for the thousand years.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:18-59:1:18" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Jas. 1:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. (a) To whom does the expression “Israel of God” refer? (b) Why is the term “Israel” not always limited in its meaning?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Clearly, then, the phrase “Israel of God” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a> refers exclusively to anointed Christians. However, are there instances when Jehovah uses the nation of Israel as a picture, or illustration, that includes Christians other than the anointed? The answer can be found in these words of Jesus to his faithful apostles: “I make a covenant <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and <em>sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-30</a>) This will take place during “the re-creation,” or time of regeneration, during Christ’s Millennial Rule.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:28-40:19:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 19:28</em></a><em>; </em>ftn.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The 144,000 will serve as heavenly kings, priests, and judges during the Thousand Year Reign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:4-66:20:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4</a>) Whom will they judge, and over whom will they rule?

They represent all those with an earthly hope<wbr />—those who put faith in Jesus’ sacrifice but are not included in the royal priestly class. (The tribe of Levi was not included in the listing of the 12 tribes of natural Israel.) Those pictured in this context by the 12 tribes of Israel are the ones who will gain spiritual benefits from the priestly services of the 144,000. These nonpriestly beneficiaries are also God’s people, and he loves and accepts them. It is appropriate that they are likened to his people of ancient times.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Fittingly, after the apostle John saw the 144,000 spiritual Israelites being permanently sealed before the great tribulation, he also observed a numberless “great crowd,” who come “out of all nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>) These will survive the great tribulation into Christ’s Millennial Reign.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 8. How do the events of the annual Atonement Day foreshadow the relationship between the 144,000 and the rest of mankind?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>This relationship between the 144,000 and the rest of mankind was foreshadowed in the events of the annual Atonement Day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:6-3:16:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lev. 16:6-10</a>) The high priest was required, first of all, to sacrifice a bull as a sin offering “in behalf of himself and his house.” Thus, Jesus’ sacrifice is applied first to his household of underpriests, those who will serve with him in heaven. Also on the ancient Atonement Day, two goats were provided for the sins of the other Israelites. In this setting, where the priestly tribe pictures the 144,000, the rest of Israel pictures all those with an earthly hope. This application shows that the term “the twelve tribes of Israel” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:28-40:19:28" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 19:28</a> refers, not to Jesus’ spirit-begotten underpriests, but to all others who put faith in Jesus’ sacrifice.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. Whom do the priests in Ezekiel’s temple vision represent, and whom do the nonpriestly Israelites represent?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span><sup>9 </sup>Consider another example. The prophet Ezekiel was given an extensive vision of Jehovah’s temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:40:1-26:48:35" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezek., chaps. 40-48</a>) In that visionary setting, the priests worked in the temple, providing instruction and receiving Jehovah’s counsel and correction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:44:23-26:44:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezek. 44:23-31</a>) In the same setting, members of the various tribes came to worship and offer sacrifices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:45:16-26:45:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezek. 45:16, 17</a>) In this context, then, the priests picture the anointed, while Israelites from the nonpriestly tribes picture those with an earthly hope. The vision emphasizes that the two groups work together harmoniously, with the priestly class taking the lead in pure worship.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What faith-strengthening fulfillment of Jesus’ words have we seen? (b) What question arises about the other sheep?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Jesus spoke of “other sheep,” who would not be of the same “fold” as the “little flock” of his anointed followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 12:32</a>) He said: “Those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” How faith-strengthening it has been to see the fulfillment of those words! Two groups of people have been joined together<wbr />—the small group of anointed ones and the great crowd of other sheep. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><em>Zechariah 8:23</em></a><em>.</em>) Although the other sheep do not symbolically serve in the inner courtyard of the spiritual temple, they do serve in the outer courtyard of that temple.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>But if Jehovah sometimes uses the nonpriestly members of ancient Israel to picture these other sheep, should those with an earthly hope also partake of the Memorial emblems? We will now consider the answer to this question.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>The New Covenant</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12. What new arrangement did Jehovah foretell?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jehovah foretold a new arrangement for his people when he said: “This is the covenant that I shall conclude with the house of Israel after those days. . . .

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jesus referred to this new covenant on the night before his death when he said: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 22:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:25-46:11:25" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:25</a>) Are all Christians included in this new covenant?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:8-48:3:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Gal. 3:8, 9</a>) Although not participants, they ‘lay hold’ of this covenant by submitting to its requirements, just as was foretold by the prophet Isaiah: “The <em>foreigners </em>that have joined themselves to Jehovah to minister to him and to love the name of Jehovah, in order to become servants to him, all those keeping the sabbath in order not to profane it and laying hold of my covenant, I will also bring them to my holy mountain and make them rejoice inside my house of prayer.” Jehovah then says: “For my own house will be called even a house of prayer for all the peoples.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:56:6-23:56:7" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 56:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15, 16. (a) To what does the apostle Paul link the new covenant? (b) Why should those with an earthly hope not partake of the Memorial emblems?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Those in the new covenant “have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place.” (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:15-58:10:20" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><em>Hebrews 10:15-20</em></a><em>.</em>) These are the ones who are “to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 12:28</a>) So, then, only those who will be kings and priests in heaven with Jesus Christ should drink from the “cup” that represents the new covenant. These participants in the new covenant are the ones promised in marriage to the Lamb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 9</a>) All others who attend the annual Memorial are respectful observers, who do not partake of the emblems.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Paul also helps us to understand that those with an earthly hope do not partake of the Memorial emblems. He said to anointed Christians: “For as often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, <em>until he arrives.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:26-46:11:26" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:26</a>) When does the Lord ‘arrive’?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 14:2, 3</a>) Clearly, the annual observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal is not to continue endlessly. “The remaining ones” of the woman’s seed yet on earth will continue to partake of this meal until all of them have received their heavenly reward. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Rev. 12:17</a>) If, though, those who will live forever on earth were entitled to partake of the emblems, then this Memorial meal would need to continue forever.</p>

Although the ever-growing great crowd do not have the heavenly hope, they are proud to be associated with those who do. They have attached themselves to the Israel of God.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “We want to express deep appreciation for the many articles you write for those of us who are raising children,” wrote a couple in New Hampshire, U.S.A. “We have a four-year-old daughter named Sophia, and we feel as though we’re getting personal coaching that helps us to imprint vital truths in her mind and heart during her formative years.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Their letter continues: “The book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher </em>is a treasure chest of practical lessons for our daughter, not to mention for us. The pictures in the last chapter are the most exquisite illustrations of Paradise that we’ve ever seen! Our little girl just pores over them time and again, absorbing the Bible’s promises.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The last chapter of <em>Learn From the Great Teacher, </em>entitled <a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1102003069/1-13">“God’s Peaceful New World<wbr />—You Can Live There,”</a> beautifully illustrates God’s promises as found in his Word, the Bible.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN someone extends an act of kindness to you, how do you show your appreciation? Consider how the military chiefs in Israel showed their gratitude after an armed conflict with the Midianites. The battle was fought after Israel had sinned in connection with Baal of Peor. God gave his people victory, and the spoils were divided between the 12,000 soldiers and the rest of Israel. In accord with Jehovah’s direction, the soldiers gave a percentage of their portion to the priests, and the other Israelites gave a similar percentage to the Levites.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:31:1-4:31:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 31:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:31:25-4:31:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, the military chiefs wanted to do more. “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are in our charge and not one has been reported missing from us,” they told Moses. They decided to present gold and various ornaments as Jehovah’s offering. The total weight of the gold ornaments <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>amounted to over 500 troy pounds (190 kg).<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:31:49-4:31:54" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 31:49-54</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today, many people are likewise moved to show their appreciation for what Jehovah has done for them. Moreover, such feelings of appreciation are not limited to God’s dedicated servants. Consider, for example, a bus driver who took a group of delegates to and from the stadium for the international convention held in Bologna, Italy, in 2009. Because he was a very careful driver with a mild spirit, those who rode his bus decided to write a thank-you note and to give him a tip along with a copy of the book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>To that, the driver responded: “I gladly accept the card and the book, but I return the money because I wish to contribute it so that you can continue the work you are doing. Even though I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I want to make this contribution because I’ve seen that you do things out of love.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When moved by appreciation for what Jehovah has done for you, one way to show your gratitude is by making contributions to the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Ways in which some choose to give are listed in the accompanying box.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><h3 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE WORK</strong></h3>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc">  Many set aside, or budget, an amount that they place in the contribution boxes labeled “Worldwide Work.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc">  Each month, congregations forward these amounts to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses that serves their respective countries. Voluntary donations of money may also be sent directly to <strong>Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., Attention Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, </strong>or to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses that serves your country. (Voluntary donations specified in the sections below can also be sent to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses that serves your country.) Checks sent to the above address should be made payable to “Watchtower.” Jewelry or other valuables may be donated as well. A brief letter stating that such items are an outright gift should accompany these contributions.</p>
<h3 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>CONDITIONAL-DONATION TRUST ARRANGEMENT</strong></h3>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc">  Money may be placed in trust with Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for use worldwide. However, upon request the funds will be returned. For more information, please contact the Treasurer’s Office by writing to the address noted above or by telephoning (718) 560-7500.</p>
<h3 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>CHARITABLE PLANNING</strong></h3>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc">  In addition to outright gifts of money, there are other methods of giving to benefit Kingdom service worldwide. These include:</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>Insurance:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="15" class="sc"> Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania may be named as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or a retirement/<wbr />pension plan.</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Bank Accounts:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="16" class="sc"> Bank accounts, certificates of deposit, or individual retirement accounts may be placed in trust for or made payable on death to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, in accord with local bank requirements.</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>Stocks and Bonds:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="17" class="sc"> Stocks and bonds may be donated to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania as an outright gift or Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania may be named as a Transfer on Death beneficiary.</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>Real Estate:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="18" class="sc"> Salable real estate may be donated either by making an outright gift or, in the case of residential property, by reserving a life estate to the donor, who can continue to live therein during his or her lifetime. Contact the branch office in your country before deeding any real estate.</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>Gift Annuity:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="19" class="sc"> A gift annuity is an arrangement whereby one transfers money or securities to a designated corporation that is used by Jehovah’s Witnesses. In exchange, the donor, or someone designated by the donor, receives a specified annuity payment every year for life. The donor receives an income-tax deduction for the year in which the gift annuity is established.</p>
<h4 class="inline" id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Wills and Trusts:</strong></h4>
<p data-pid="20" class="sc"> Property or money may be bequeathed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania by means of a legally executed will, or Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania may be named as beneficiary of a trust agreement. A trust benefiting a religious organization may provide certain tax advantages.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc">  As the term “charitable planning” implies, these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor. To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses through some form of charitable planning, a brochure has been prepared in English and Spanish entitled <strong><em>Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide. </em></strong>The brochure was written to provide information on a variety of ways that gifts may be made either now or through a bequest at death. After reading the brochure and conferring with their own legal or tax advisers, many have been able to help support our religious and humanitarian activities worldwide and maximize their tax benefits while doing so. This brochure may be obtained by requesting a copy directly from the Charitable Planning Office.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jesus Christ told his followers that he came to earth, “not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) He willingly gave up his life for the benefit of others.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How did Jesus, by his death, provide a ransom? Why was this necessary? For whom did Jesus lay down his life? And what can his death mean for you?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to meet with them to examine the Bible’s answers to these questions. This year, the anniversary of Jesus’ death falls on <strong>Tuesday, March 30, </strong>after sundown. On that occasion, Scriptural answers to the above questions will be presented.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.</p>

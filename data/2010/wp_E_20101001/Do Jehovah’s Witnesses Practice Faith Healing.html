<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Practice Faith Healing?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Jehovah’s Witnesses have never practiced faith healing. Like Jesus, they believe that their primary mission is to preach the good news about God’s Kingdom. They also believe that true Christians are identified, not by faith healing, but by something of far greater importance.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To be sure, the compassionate healing of the sick in the first century C.E. by Jesus Christ is of great significance to all of us. He thereby furnished a guarantee that under his rule as King of God’s Kingdom, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What, though, about today? Faith healers in Christendom as well as in some non-Christian religions claim to perform miraculous healings. Yet, Jesus himself sternly warned against individuals who would claim to have “performed many miracles” in his name. He would say to them: “I never knew you. Get away from me, you evildoers!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:22-40:7:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 7:22, 23</a>, <em>International Standard Version</em>) So, are the supposed miracles of modern-day faith healers really an indication of God’s approval or blessing?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consider what the Bible says about the healings performed by Jesus. By comparing that Scriptural record with the methods of faith healers today, we can readily determine whether modern-day faith healing is from God.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus never used healing as a means of attracting followers or large audiences. On the contrary, he performed a number of healings out of public view. Many times he told those whom he cured to reveal the miracle to no one.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:13-42:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 5:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus never charged money for his miracles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 10:8</a>) He also had an unfailing record of success. <em>All </em>sick ones who came to him were completely cured, and the healing did not depend on the individual’s faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:19-42:6:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 6:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:5-43:5:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 5:5-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:13-43:5:13" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Why, Jesus even raised the dead!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:7:11-42:7:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 7:11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:40-42:8:56" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 8:40-56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> John 11:38-44</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Though he did perform those miracles, the focus of Jesus’ ministry was not on gathering converts by means of emotional sessions of miracle working. Instead, his primary work was to declare the good news of God’s Kingdom. Jesus organized his followers to become disciple makers, who would teach others about the hope of attaining perfect health under God’s Kingdom.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Granted, some of Jesus’ first-century followers had special gifts of healing, but these were to cease. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:29-46:12:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 13:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:13-46:13:13" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 13</a>) True Christians today are identified, not by acts of healing, but by the bond of self-sacrificing love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Modern-day faith healing has not produced a genuine family of Christians from all races and backgrounds who are bound together by such love.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">There is, however, a group of Christians who are united by a bond of love so strong that they refuse to harm one another<wbr />—or anyone else for that matter—<wbr />even during the fiercest of human conflicts. Who are they? Jehovah’s Witnesses. Worldwide, they are known for displaying Christlike love. Uniting people of diverse racial, national, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds is a miracle, so to speak, and is made possible only by God’s holy spirit. Why not attend one of their meetings and see for yourself?</p>

This is an increase of 24,074 over the previous peak set in August 2009. The Turks and Caicos Islands also reached a new all-time peak of 273 Kingdom publishers, an increase of 17 over their previous peak set in July 2010. Additionally, Bermuda saw fine progress in August with a 16.6 percent increase in return visits and a 3.1 percent increase in Bible studies when compared to the same month last year.

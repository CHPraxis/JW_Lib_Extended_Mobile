<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The theme for the <em>2011 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>is Family Worship. The calendar features modern-day families and their Biblical equivalents. It also shows married couples and single servants of Jehovah studying his Word.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible characters shown on the calendar delighted in the law of Jehovah, and this was vital in helping them to deal with the unique challenges they faced. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:2-19:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3</a>) As we examine each scene, we will be reminded of the importance of Family Worship, whether we belong to a family that is large or small, spiritually united or divided. Space is provided on the calendar for you to indicate the day your family has set aside for Family Worship. Have you filled it out?</p>

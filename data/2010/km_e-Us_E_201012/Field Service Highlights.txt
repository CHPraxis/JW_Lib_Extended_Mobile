Field Service Highlights
How happy we are to report a new all-time peak of 1,178,349 Kingdom publishers for the United States in the month of August! This is an increase of 24,074 over the previous peak set in August 2009. The Turks and Caicos Islands also reached a new all-time peak of 273 Kingdom publishers, an increase of 17 over their previous peak set in July 2010. Additionally, Bermuda saw fine progress in August with a 16.6 percent increase in return visits and a 3.1 percent increase in Bible studies when compared to the same month last year. Indeed, the fields are “white for harvesting”!—John 4:35.

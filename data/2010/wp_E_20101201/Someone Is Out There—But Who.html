<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">In Europe, an elderly woman enters a church, rosary in hand, and kneels reverently before a statue of Mary. In Africa, a family pours out gin at the graveside of a respected relative. In the Americas, a young man fasts and meditates, hoping to contact what he believes to be his guardian angel. In Asia, a priest burns colorful paper objects as an offering to ancestral spirits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT do these people have in common? All believe that there are intelligent beings in the spirit realm who can be contacted and who have the ability to influence profoundly the lives of humans. Of course, this belief is neither new nor surprising. What is surprising is that there are so many conflicting ideas about who live in the spirit realm.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Muslims worship one God<wbr />—Allah.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> People in Christendom say that God is a Trinity, made up of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Hindus believe in the existence of more than a thousand gods and goddesses. Other people say that spirits reside in certain animals, trees, rocks, and streams. Still others are influenced by books, movies, and television programs about angels and demons, ghosts and goblins, gods and goddesses.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just as there are many varied and conflicting ideas about gods and deities, there are also many varied and conflicting ideas about how to approach them. Logic tells us that not all approaches can be correct. Think of it this way: Before we make a telephone call, we need to know whom we are calling and we need to be confident that the person really exists and will be receptive to our call. To try to contact an imaginary person would be pointless. Worse yet, to contact an impostor could be dangerous.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So, then, who really live in the spirit realm? The Bible not only answers this question but also explains whom to communicate with and what to expect in return. Read on. You may be surprised at what the Bible reveals.</p>

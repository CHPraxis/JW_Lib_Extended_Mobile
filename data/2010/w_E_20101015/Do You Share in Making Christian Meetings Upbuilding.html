<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“When you come together, . . . let all things take place for upbuilding.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:26-46:14:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 COR. 14:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 1. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:1-46:14:40" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 14</a>, what is an important objective of Christian meetings?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">‘THAT was such an upbuilding meeting!’ Have you expressed similar sentiments after attending a meeting at the Kingdom Hall? No doubt you have! Congregation meetings truly are a source of encouragement, but that is not surprising. After all, just as in the days of the early Christians, an important objective of our meetings today is to strengthen spiritually all in attendance. Note how the apostle Paul emphasizes that specific goal of Christian meetings in his first letter to the Corinthians. Throughout <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:1-46:14:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b">chapter 14</a>, he states time and again that each part delivered at congregation meetings should have the same objective<wbr />—“the <em>upbuilding </em>of the congregation.”<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:3-46:14:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>1 Corinthians 14:3,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:12-46:14:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <em>12,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:26-46:14:26" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> <em>26</em></a><em>.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. (a) Upbuilding meetings are the result of what? (b) What question will we consider?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><sup>2 </sup>We realize that upbuilding, or edifying, meetings are first of all the result of the influence of God’s spirit. Therefore, we begin each congregation meeting with a heartfelt prayer to Jehovah in which our heavenly Father is asked to bless our gathering by means of his holy spirit. Still, we know that all members of the congregation can have a share in making the meeting programs as upbuilding as possible. So, then, what are some of the steps we can personally take to make sure that the weekly meetings conducted at our Kingdom Hall are always a source of spiritual refreshment and encouragement?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. How important are Christian meetings?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>To answer, we will examine some aspects of our meetings that should be kept in mind by those who conduct them. We will also consider how the congregation as a whole can share in making meetings uplifting occasions for all who attend. This subject is of great interest to us because our meetings are sacred gatherings. Indeed, attending and participating in meetings are important features of our worship to Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:26:12-19:26:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 26:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:111:1-19:111:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 111:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:66:22-23:66:23" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Isa. 66:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>A Meeting Designed for Studying the Bible</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">4, 5. What is the objective of the <em>Watchtower </em>Study?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>All of us want to benefit fully from our weekly <em>Watchtower </em>Study. Hence, to understand clearly the principal objective of that meeting, let us review some of the adjustments that have been made to the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine and the study articles.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Starting with the first study edition of <em>The Watchtower, </em>the January 15, 2008, issue, a significant detail was included on the front cover. Did you notice it? Take a good look at the cover of the magazine you are holding. There, at the base of the tower, you will note an open Bible. That added feature underscores the reason why we have the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. It is to study the Bible with the help of this magazine. Yes, at our weekly <em>Watchtower </em>Study, God’s Word is “being expounded,” and just as in the time of Nehemiah of old, there is “a putting of meaning into it.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa. 54:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. (a) What adjustment was made to the <em>Watchtower </em>Study? (b) What should be kept in mind regarding “read” scriptures?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Because the Bible is our main textbook, an adjustment was made to the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. Several cited scriptures in the study articles are marked “read.” All of us are encouraged to follow the reading of these scriptures during the meeting, using our own copy of the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:11-44:17:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>) Why? When we see God’s counsel in our own Bible, it makes a deeper impression on us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) Therefore, before such scriptures are read out loud, the one conducting the meeting should give all in attendance sufficient time to look up these scriptures and to follow along as the verses are read.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>More Time Available to Express Our Faith</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. What opportunity do we have during the <em>Watchtower </em>Study?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Still another adjustment to the <em>Watchtower </em>study articles has to do with their length. In recent years, they are shorter. Thus, during the <em>Watchtower </em>Study, less time is used for reading paragraphs while more time is available for giving comments. More in the congregation now have an opportunity to make a public expression of their faith by answering a printed question, by giving an application of a scripture, by relating a brief experience that illustrates the wisdom of following Bible principles, or in <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>other ways. Some time should also be spent discussing the artwork.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 22:22;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:35:18-19:35:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <em>35:18;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:9-19:40:9" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> <em>40:9</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">8, 9. What is the role of the <em>Watchtower </em>Study conductor?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>However, that additional time for giving a variety of comments will be available only if participants comment briefly and the one conducting the meeting refrains from commenting too often himself during the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. So, then, what may help a conductor to find the proper balance between his comments and those given by the congregation so that the meeting will be upbuilding to all?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>To answer, consider an illustration. A <em>Watchtower </em>Study that is well-conducted is like a bouquet of flowers that delights the eye. Just as a large bouquet is made up of many individual flowers, so a <em>Watchtower </em>Study is made up of many different comments. And just as the individual flowers in a bouquet differ in size and color, so the comments given during the meeting vary in length and manner of presentation. And where does the <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>conductor fit in? His occasional comments are like the few pieces of greenery that are carefully added to a bouquet. These pieces do not dominate; rather, they serve to provide structure and to unify the whole. Similarly, the one who conducts needs to keep in mind that his role is, not to overwhelm, but to complement the expressions of praise that are offered by the congregation. Yes, when the many diverse comments given by the congregation and the few well-placed remarks made by the conductor are skillfully put together, they form a beautiful bouquet of words that will delight all in attendance.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>“Let Us Always Offer to God a Sacrifice of Praise”</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. How did early Christians view congregation meetings?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Paul’s description of Christian meetings found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:26-46:14:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:26-33</a> gives us insight into how those gatherings were conducted in the first century. In commenting on these verses, one Bible scholar writes: “The really notable thing about an early Church service must have been that almost everyone came feeling that he had both the privilege and the obligation of contributing something to it. A man did not come with the sole intention of being a passive listener; he came not only to receive but to give.” Indeed, early Christians viewed congregation meetings as opportunities to express their faith.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:10-45:10:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 10:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. (a) What contributes greatly to upbuilding meetings, and why? (b) Applying what suggestions may improve our comments at meetings? (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Expressing our faith at meetings greatly contributes to “the upbuilding of the congregation.” Surely you will agree that no matter how many years we may have been attending meetings, it remains a true pleasure to listen to the comments made by our brothers and sisters. We are touched by a heartfelt answer expressed by an elderly, faithful fellow believer; we feel uplifted by an insightful observation made by a caring elder; and we cannot help but smile when a child blurts out a spontaneous comment that expresses genuine love for Jehovah. Clearly, by giving comments, all of us share in making Christian meetings upbuilding.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12. (a) What can be learned from the examples of Moses and Jeremiah? (b) What role does prayer play in giving comments?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>For those who are timid, though, giving comments can be a real challenge. If that is the case with you, it may be helpful to remember that your situation is not unusual. In fact, even such faithful servants of God as Moses and Jeremiah expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to speak in public. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:10-2:4:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:1:6-24:1:6" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Jer. 1:6</a>) Yet, just as Jehovah helped those servants of old to praise him publicly, God will help you to offer sacrifices of praise. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><em>Hebrews 13:15</em></a><em>.</em>) How can you receive Jehovah’s help in overcoming your fear of giving comments? First, prepare well for the meeting. Then, before you go to the Kingdom Hall, approach Jehovah in prayer and specifically petition him to give you the courage to give a comment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6</a>) You <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>are requesting something that is “according to his will,” so you can be confident that Jehovah will answer your prayer.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:29-20:15:29" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>Meetings That Aim to ‘Upbuild, Encourage, and Console’</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13. (a) What effect should our meetings have upon those in attendance? (b) What question is of special importance to elders?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Paul states that an important purpose of congregation meetings is to ‘upbuild, encourage, and console’ those in attendance.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:3-46:14:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:3</a>) How can Christian elders today make sure that their meeting parts indeed lift the spirits of their brothers and sisters and leave them consoled? To answer, let us consider a meeting that Jesus conducted shortly after his resurrection.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">14. (a) What events preceded a meeting that was arranged by Jesus? (b) Why must the apostles have been relieved when “Jesus approached and spoke to them”?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>First, note the events that preceded that meeting. Just before Jesus was put to death, the apostles “abandoned him and fled,” and as foretold, they were “scattered each one to his own house.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:50-41:14:50" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 14:50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:32-43:16:32" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> John 16:32</a>) Then, after his resurrection, Jesus invited his downhearted apostles to attend a special meeting.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> In response, “the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them.” When they arrived, “Jesus approached and spoke to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:10-40:28:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 28:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:16-40:28:16" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 18</a>) Imagine how relieved the apostles must have been when Jesus took that initiative! What did Jesus discuss?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. (a) What subjects did Jesus consider, but what did he not discuss? (b) How did that meeting affect the apostles?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jesus began by making an announcement: “All authority has been given me.” Then he gave them an assignment: “Go therefore and make disciples.” Finally, he gave them warm assurance: “I am with you all the days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) But did you note what Jesus did <em>not </em>do? He did not reprimand his apostles; nor did he use that meeting to question their motives or to deepen their feelings of guilt by referring to their momentary weakness of faith. Instead, Jesus reassured them of his and his Father’s love by entrusting them with a weighty assignment. How did Jesus’ approach affect the apostles? They were so upbuilt, encouraged, and consoled that some time after that meeting, they were once again “teaching and declaring the good news.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 5:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. How do Christian elders today imitate Jesus’ example in conducting meetings that are a source of refreshment?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>In imitation of Jesus, elders today view meetings as opportunities to reassure fellow believers of the unfailing love that Jehovah has for his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 8:38, 39</a>) Hence, in their meeting parts, elders focus on their brothers’ strengths, not on their weaknesses. They do not question their brothers’ motives. Rather, their expressions reveal that they view their fellow believers as individuals who love Jehovah and want to do what is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:4:1-52:4:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:4:9-52:4:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 9-12</a>) Of course, the elders may at times need to give corrective counsel to the congregation in general, but if just a few individuals need to be readjusted, such counsel is usually best given in a private conversation with those involved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:24-55:2:26" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 2:24-26</a>) When addressing the entire congregation, elders aim to give commendation whenever it is fitting.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc"><strong>Prepare in advance. </strong>When you study in advance the material that will be discussed at the Kingdom Hall, the meetings will capture your interest more fully and leave a deeper impression.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="se"><strong>Attend regularly. </strong>Since a good attendance is more encouraging to everyone present, your presence makes a difference.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="se"><strong>Arrive on time. </strong>If you are seated before the program starts, you can join in the opening song and prayer, which form part of our worship to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="se"><strong>Come well-equipped. </strong>Bring your Bible and the publication(s) used during the meeting so that you can follow along and better grasp what is being discussed.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="se"><strong>Avoid distractions. </strong>For example, read electronic text messages after, not during, the meetings. In that way, you keep personal affairs in their proper place.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="se"><strong>Participate. </strong>When more give comments, more are encouraged and built up by the diverse expressions of faith.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="se"><strong>Keep your comments brief. </strong>This gives as many as possible an opportunity to share in commenting.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="se"><strong>Fulfill assignments. </strong>As students in the Theocratic Ministry School or as participants in the Service Meeting, prepare well, rehearse in advance, and try hard not to cancel your assignments.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="se"><strong>Commend participants. </strong>Tell those who have a part at the meeting or who give comments how much their efforts are appreciated.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="se"><strong>Associate. </strong>Kind greetings and upbuilding conversations before and after meetings add much to the pleasure and benefits that come from being present.</p>

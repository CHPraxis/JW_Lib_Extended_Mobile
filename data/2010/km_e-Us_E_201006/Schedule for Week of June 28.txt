Conclude with another demonstration showing how a Bible study may be started on the return visit.—See km 8/07 p. 3.
15 min: Trained From Infancy. Audience discussion. Timothy was known as a zealous and skillful evangelizer. (Phil. 2:20-22) This was due, in some measure, to the spiritual foundation he received from his mother and grandmother from the time he was an infant. (2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15) The following Scriptural suggestions will help parents to train their children to become good evangelizers. (1) Take your child in the ministry as soon as possible; train him to participate according to his age and ability. (Prov. 22:6) (2) Set a good example in making the ministry a priority. (Phil. 1:9, 10) (3) Instill love and appreciation for the preaching work during Family Worship and on other occasions. (Deut. 6:6, 7) (4) Be positive about the ministry in your attitude and speech. (Phil. 3:8; 4:8; 1 Tim. 1:12) (5) Share regularly as a family, making the ministry a habit. (Acts 5:41, 42) (6) Associate with those who are zealous ministers. (Prov. 13:20) Invite the audience to comment on specific things their parents did to help them to develop an enjoyable and effective ministry.

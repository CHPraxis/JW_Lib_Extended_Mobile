<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Trained From Infancy. Audience discussion. Timothy was known as a zealous and skillful evangelizer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:20-50:2:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 2:20-22</a>) This was due, in some measure, to the spiritual foundation he received from his mother and grandmother from the time he was an infant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:1:5-55:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:15</a>) The following Scriptural suggestions will help parents to train their children to become good evangelizers. (1) Take your child in the ministry as soon as possible; train him to participate according to his age and ability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>) (2) Set a good example in making the ministry a priority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:9-50:1:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 1:9, 10</a>) (3) Instill love and appreciation for the preaching work during Family Worship and on other occasions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>) (4) Be positive about the ministry in your attitude and speech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:8-50:3:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Phil. 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:12-54:1:12" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:12</a>) (5) Share regularly as a family, making the ministry a habit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:41-44:5:42" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 5:41, 42</a>) (6) Associate with those who are zealous ministers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) Invite the audience to comment on specific things their parents did to help them to develop an enjoyable and effective ministry.</p>

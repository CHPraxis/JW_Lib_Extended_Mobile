Secret 2
Resist the Urge to Compare Yourself With Others
WHAT DOES THE BIBLE TEACH? “Do your own work well, and then you will have something to be proud of. But don’t compare yourself with others.”—Galatians 6:4, Contemporary English Version.
WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE? We may like to compare ourselves with others—sometimes with those who have less than we have, often with those who are stronger, wealthier, or more talented than we are. Either way, the effect is negative. We mistakenly assume that a person’s worth is determined by what he has or what he is able to do. We may also stir up feelings of envy and a spirit of competition.—Ecclesiastes 4:4.
WHAT CAN YOU DO? Try to see yourself as God sees you. Allow his view to influence your sense of self-worth. “Mere man sees what appears to the eyes; but as for Jehovah,a he sees what the heart is.” (1 Samuel 16:7) Jehovah gauges your worth, not by comparing you with some other human, but by reading your heart, examining your thoughts, feelings, and intentions. (Hebrews 4:12, 13) Jehovah understands your limitations and urges you to respect them too. If you measure your own worth by comparing yourself with others, you will end up either haughty or chronically discontented. So modestly accept that you will not excel in every endeavor.—Proverbs 11:2.
What specifically must you do to have value in God’s eyes? He inspired the prophet Micah to write: “He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?” (Micah 6:8) If you follow that advice, God will care for you. (1 Peter 5:6, 7) What greater reason for contentment could there be?

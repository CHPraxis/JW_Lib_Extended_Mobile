Purpose of Study Articles
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 3-11
These articles examine what it means to dedicate oneself to Jehovah and why one needs to take that step. We will also consider why we can be confident that we will be able to do what Jehovah expects of us. Furthermore, we will learn what blessings are enjoyed by all those who belong to Jehovah.
STUDY ARTICLE 3  PAGES 12-16
This article examines five important areas in which each of us should strive to imitate Christ. By doing that, we will prove to be Christ’s real followers, and we will be able to help sheeplike ones to recognize the true Christian congregation.
STUDY ARTICLES 4, 5  PAGES 24-32
The fourth article considers why human rulership independent from God has been a disaster and how it has served to highlight the excellence of Jehovah’s way of ruling. The fifth article discusses how we can demonstrate that we have accepted Jehovah’s way of ruling.

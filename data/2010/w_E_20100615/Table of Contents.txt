Purpose of Study Articles
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 6-14
These articles will deepen our appreciation for the blessings we receive by being in the Christian congregation. We will also see areas in which we personally can build up and help brothers and sisters in our local congregation.
STUDY ARTICLES 3, 4  PAGES 15-24
These two articles consider how applying Bible principles can help us to remain peaceable despite our imperfections and those of others. They also show how using gracious speech can do much to promote good relations.
STUDY ARTICLE 5  PAGES 25-29
The world has a distorted sense of what brings refreshment, emphasizing activities that please the flesh. God’s people find refreshment in spiritual things. This article shows how we can have a deep, long-lasting sense of joy and satisfaction.

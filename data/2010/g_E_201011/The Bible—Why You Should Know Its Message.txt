The Bible—Why You Should Know Its Message
● The Bible is the most widely distributed book in all history, and many cherish it. Oaths are sworn on it in courts of law, and officials take oaths of office with their hand upon it. Knowledge of the Bible constitutes the most important education one can receive.
Many will agree that the world would be a better place if more people read the Bible and lived by what it says. The 32-page, tastefully illustrated brochure The Bible—What Is Its Message? can help you learn what the Bible teaches. Its first two sections describe how the Creator provided a paradise for humans and how it was lost. In the next sections, there is a historical review of the people through whom God provided the Ruler of his Kingdom government, which will restore Paradise to this earth.
Sections that follow describe the life, ministry, miracles, death, and resurrection of the divinely appointed Ruler, Jesus Christ. In rapid sequence, the next four sections describe the ministry, faith under trial, and inspired writings of Jesus’ first-century followers. You will be cheered by the section “Paradise Regained!” with its accompanying colorfully illustrated final page, entitled “The Bible’s Message—An Overview.”

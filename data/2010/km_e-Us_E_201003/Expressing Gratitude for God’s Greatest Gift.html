<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. Why are we especially grateful to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Of Jehovah’s many ‘good gifts,’ the ransom provided by his dear Son is the greatest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) It makes possible many blessings, including forgiveness of our sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 1:7</a>) For this we are always grateful. During the Memorial season, we particularly take time to meditate on this precious gift.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How can we build appreciation for the ransom in our family and ourselves?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Build Appreciation: </strong>So as to build your family’s appreciation, in the weeks preceding the Memorial on March 30, why not use time during your Family Worship evening to review information on the ransom? Also consider the special Memorial Bible reading each day as a family. Personally reflect on how the ransom has benefited you and affected your view of Jehovah, yourself, others, and the future. You will also find it advantageous to practice singing the two new songs that will be used at the Memorial, numbers <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009083/1-21">8 and</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009167/1-31"> 109</a>.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:77:12-19:77:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 77:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How may we express our gratitude?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Expressions of Gratitude: </strong>Appreciation for the ransom moves us to tell others about Jehovah and his great love in sending his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:2-19:145:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 145:2-7</a>) During March, April, and May, some families express their gratitude by arranging for at least one family member to auxiliary pioneer. If this is not possible, can you ‘buy out time’ to enlarge your share in the ministry? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16</a>) Gratitude will also motivate us to help others to attend the Memorial with us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>) Begin making up a list of return visits, Bible students, relatives, workmates, and neighbors to invite, and then have a full share in the special Memorial invitation campaign.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. In what ways may we use the Memorial season wisely?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The Memorial season provides new opportunities to demonstrate to Jehovah how much we appreciate his gift to mankind. May we use this time to build and express our gratitude for the ransom and all “the unfathomable riches of the Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:8-49:3:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 3:8</a>.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Publishers should have in mind starting a Bible study when this publication is placed or if a copy is already in the home. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on placing What Does the Bible Really Teach? The objective is to start a Bible study. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, publishers may offer Draw Close to Jehovah, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, Worship the Only True God, or any other field service publication that the congregation has in stock.
▪ The Memorial will be held on Tuesday, March 30, 2010. Songs to be used for the Memorial are numbers 8 and 109 from the new songbook. If your congregation normally has its meeting on Tuesday, efforts should be made to switch the meeting to another day of the week. In the case where many congregations share the Kingdom Hall and a meeting cannot be rescheduled, the meeting may be canceled. Service Meeting parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.

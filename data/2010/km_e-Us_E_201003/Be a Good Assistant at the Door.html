<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What benefits come from working with a partner in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>On one occasion, Jesus sent 70 disciples to preach, and he “sent them forth by twos.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:1-42:10:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 10:1</a>) No doubt this arrangement allowed his disciples to help and encourage one another as they preached. When we accompany another publisher in the ministry, how may we be helpful?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. When our partner is giving his presentation, how and why should we listen?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>By Listening: </strong>Listen attentively as your partner gives his presentation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 1:19</a>) If a scripture is read, follow along in your Bible. Look at the one speaking, whether it is your partner or the householder. If you pay close attention to the conversation, this may encourage the householder to do the same.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. When may our partner welcome our speaking up?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>By Discerning When to Speak: </strong>When we are with someone who is giving his presentation, we dignify him by allowing him to take the lead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10</a>) We should avoid interrupting. If he loses his thought or the householder raises an objection or question and our partner requests assistance, we endeavor to supplement our partner’s comments rather than introduce a different subject. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:23-20:16:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 16:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eccl. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 7</a>) If we speak, our words should contribute to the witness being given.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:8-46:14:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. What will contribute to our joy and success in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>When the 35 pairs of disciples concluded preaching, they “returned with joy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:17-42:10:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 10:17</a>) We too will have joy and success in the ministry as we listen and discern when to speak when we assist those we accompany to the door.</p>

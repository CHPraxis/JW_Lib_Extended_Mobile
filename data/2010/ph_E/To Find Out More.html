<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Buddhika told Sanath and Vasana that he and Anushka would be happy to help them learn more about all the wonderful things they had been discussing. He showed them a book called <em>What Can the Bible Teach Us?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Sanath and Vasana examined the book, they saw in the table of contents many subjects that they had always wondered about. Buddhika then explained that the book has many interesting features. He said:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“At the end of each chapter, there is a two-page summary of the key points of the chapter and the Bible texts that support them. There are many instructive illustrations throughout the book, and the material is written in a style that is easy to read and understand.”</p>

They were looking forward to learning more about all the things Buddhika had told them and making sure that these things were not just a dream. And Sanath and Vasana were grateful to Buddhika and Anushka for their willingness to help them find the pathway to peace and happiness.</p>

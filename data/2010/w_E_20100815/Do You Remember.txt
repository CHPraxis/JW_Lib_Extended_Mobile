Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• What will help you to raise responsible children?
“Set the pattern” for your child as to responsible behavior. (John 13:15) Have reasonable expectations; as he grows older, you can ask more of him in matters of cleanliness, punctuality, and schoolwork. Provide specific instructions in order to train your child to handle his responsibilities.—5/1, pages 19-20.
• Why did God not punish Aaron for making the golden calf?
Aaron did break God’s law about idolatry. (Ex. 20:3-5) Yet, Moses supplicated God in Aaron’s behalf, and his supplication had “much force.” (Jas. 5:16) Aaron had a record of faithfulness. And though the people persuaded Aaron to make the calf, he later showed that his heart was not with them, for he joined the sons of Levi in taking Jehovah’s side. (Ex. 32:25-29)—5/15, page 21.
• Where was Ophir, mentioned in the Bible as a source of gold?
To bring gold from Ophir, Solomon constructed ships in Ezion-geber. (1 Ki. 9:26-28) That port was at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba near present-day Elat and Aqaba, on the Red Sea. Thus, Ophir may have been in Arabia near the Red Sea or on the African or Indian coasts.—6/1, page 15.
• To what does “balsam in Gilead” refer? (Jer. 8:22)
Balsam oil was an aromatic, resinous oil secreted by various plants found, among other places, in Gilead, east of the Jordan River. Having medicinal properties, it was applied to wounds. Israel’s pitiable condition should have moved the nation to seek a cure, but the people did not. (Jer. 8:9)—6/1, pages 21-22.
• What may help a Christian cope with a spouse’s adultery?
If the innocent mate has tried to live by Bible principles, there is no need to feel guilty over the betrayal by the adulterer. God knows your need for comfort and encouragement. He may provide comfort through fellow Christians.—6/15, pages 30-31.
• What can you do to help one who is ill?
Be a good listener. (Eccl. 3:1, 7) Be empathetic and considerate. (Rom. 12:15) Be upbuilding and helpful. (Col. 4:6; 1 John 3:18) Stay connected. (Prov. 17:17)—7/1, pages 10-13.
• How do we know that God did not have a beginning?
Moses indicated this in prayer. (Ps. 90:2) Accordingly, Jehovah bears the unique title “King of eternity.” (1 Tim. 1:17)—7/1, page 28.
• How can you instill in your children a love for reading?
A loving atmosphere and parental example help to instill a love for reading. Also, make books available. Read out loud. Encourage participation, discussing what you read. Have your children read to you, and urge them to ask questions.—7/15, page 26.
• Why did Jesus not hurry to his sick friend Lazarus and heal him?
By the time Jesus arrived, Lazarus had been dead for four days. By waiting, Jesus gave a better witness about his Father. Thus, many became believers. (John 11:45)—8/1, pages 14-15.
• What were the “high places”?
In most cases, the references are to open-air hilltop sites or other places of false worship. Sometimes altars, sacred pillars or poles, and other religious trappings were set up at sites to carry on practices that God condemned. (Num. 33:52)—8/1, page 23.

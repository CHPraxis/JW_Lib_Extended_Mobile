<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>• Why did God not punish Aaron for making the golden calf?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Aaron did break God’s law about idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:20:3-2:20:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 20:3-5</a>) Yet, Moses supplicated God in Aaron’s behalf, and his supplication had “much force.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:16-59:5:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 5:16</a>) Aaron had a record of faithfulness. And though the people persuaded Aaron to make the calf, he later showed that his heart was not with them, for he joined the sons of Levi in taking Jehovah’s side.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">In most cases, the references are to open-air hilltop sites or other places of false worship.

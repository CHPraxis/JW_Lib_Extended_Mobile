SECTION 1
Does God Care About Us?




TODAY’S world is full of problems. Wars, natural disasters, sickness, poverty, corruption, and other evils afflict millions of people. You too may face daily worries. Who can help us? Does anyone care?




God’s love for us is greater than that of a mother for her baby



We can be sure that God truly cares. In his Holy Word, he states: “Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly? Even these women can forget, yet I myself shall not forget you.”a
Is that not comforting to know? God’s love is far greater than a mother’s tender compassion for her baby​—one of the strongest human emotions. Never will God abandon us! Indeed, he has already come to our aid in a marvelous way. How? By showing us the key to a happy life​—real faith.
Having genuine faith will make you happy. Such faith will help you to avoid many problems and to deal successfully with problems you cannot avoid. It will also draw you close to God, bringing you peace of mind and heart. And real faith leads to a wonderful future​—everlasting life in Paradise!
But what is real faith? And how can you cultivate it?



See Isaiah 49:15 in the Holy Scriptures.

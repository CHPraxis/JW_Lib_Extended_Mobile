<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">HAVING real faith is more than just believing that God exists. There are millions of people who believe in God yet deliberately do wicked deeds. Such “faith” is like counterfeit money. It looks real but is actually worthless. What, then, is <em>real</em> faith?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong><em>Real faith is based on accurate knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</em></strong> These inspired writings tell us the truth about God and enable us to get to know him. They reveal his laws, purposes, and teachings. These teachings include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">  God is one. He has no equal.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">  Jesus is not Almighty God. He is God’s prophet.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">  God condemns idolatry in all its forms.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">  Humans face a coming day of judgment.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">  Countless dead humans will be resurrected to Paradise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong><em>Real faith moves us to do fine works.</em></strong> Such works honor God and also benefit us and others. These fine works include such things as</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">  worshipping God.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">  cultivating godly qualities​—especially love.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">  rejecting evil thoughts and desires.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">  maintaining faith in God despite trials.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">  teaching others about God.</p>

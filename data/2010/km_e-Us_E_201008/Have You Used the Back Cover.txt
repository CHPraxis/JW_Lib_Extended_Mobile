Have You Used the Back Cover?
When people pick up a magazine, they usually look at the cover then impulsively turn it over and glance at the back. The back cover of the public edition of The Watchtower has several interest-arousing questions and statements along with the page numbers indicating where the information can be found.
We can use this feature to get good ideas for introductory questions to start a conversation. If we work the territory frequently, we can vary our presentation by using different questions throughout the month. If a householder is busy, we could shorten our presentation by showing one of the questions on the back cover and saying, “If you would like to learn the answer, I can leave these magazines with you, and we can talk more when you have time.” Some publishers may want to start conversations by showing the back cover to the householder and inviting him to choose a question that interests him. Then they may point out where the answer is found and read a scripture chosen in advance. Perhaps you can think of other ways to use the back cover to stimulate interest in The Watchtower.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the United States, more than 1.1 million publishers made over 6.2 million return visits in April. Additionally, 2,227 individuals were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah, and 23 new congregations were formed. We are also pleased to report the continued growth in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Six new all-time peaks were reported in April, including the peak of 250 publishers who conducted a peak of 710 Bible studies. What a joy to share in Jehovah’s great spiritual harvest!</p>

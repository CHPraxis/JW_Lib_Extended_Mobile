<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;—Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH has made it clearly to appear to the anointed remnant and to their companions that his kingdom under Christ is the doctrine of paramount importance set forth in the Scriptures. This is true because it is the kingdom that will vindicate Jehovah’s name. The Devil has put forth religion as a subtle means of teaching and causing men to teach doctrines exactly contrary to the kingdom. Not one of the religious institutions in existence today attempts to instruct the people concerning the importance of God’s kingdom under Christ. The religious institutions magnify the importance of men, showing outward loyalty to earthly governments, and the necessity to make themselves appear as those who have developed a beautiful character. They make much ado with their mouths about individual development of character, while at the same time pursuing a course exactly the opposite to God and his King. During the “Elijah period” of the church’s work on earth many sincere persons committed exactly the same error. “Character development” was magnified as the important thing, and it was then said of one of the “elective elders”, who for some years had been serving: “Note how he has grown. He is now so ripe and mellow, surely he is about ready to go to heaven. Soon the Lord will gather him.” Those words sounded nice to ears that love to hear them, but were very deceptive and misleading. To be sure, it is important that one should be honest, chaste, reliable, dependable, and do what is right. That is to be expected, and even required of men who make no pretense of serving God. One may do all these things, claiming to be a Christian, and not be one at all. The important thing for a real Christian to learn is the purpose of God and what is his will concerning his creatures and then to be diligent to obey God’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ That which is magnified throughout the Scriptures is God’s government, which government is theocratic; that is, Christ Jesus is the Head of the royal organization carrying out and accomplishing Jehovah God’s purpose. God gave his word that he would set up his government; and since a “theocracy” means a government by the Supreme Being, that promised government, of necessity, is a theocracy. After the rebellion in Eden God’s first expression to man of and concerning His purpose was that relative to his coining government. Every one of his holy prophets, without a single exception, prophesied concerning the kingdom of God and its establishment, with Messiah as the Head thereof. For eighteen centuries Jehovah used his typical people Israel foretelling the bringing in of his kingdom. With them he made many prophetic pictures or dramas foretelling the development and setting up of his kingdom. When Jesus came to earth he began the work by announcing the kingdom of heaven. Jesus stressed the kingdom with his disciples, and those faithful apostles, while they lived, magnified the importance of the second coming of Christ Jesus and the kingdom. At all times, from Eden till now, who has opposed God’s kingdom? The answer is, and must be, that Satan, the adversary of God, has fought everything concerning the kingdom. Satan is a subtle foe. He is the original deceiver and master of fraud. What means has Satan used with greatest effect to deceive men and cause them to oppose the kingdom of God under Christ? The answer is, and of necessity must be, religion. He has used men as teachers of religion and by subtle words and seemingly good doctrines has induced men to build up an organization into which many credulous ones have been unwittingly drawn. The entire religious system, including that of the so-called “Christian religious” system, has been and is anti-Christ and therefore anti-God’s kingdom under Christ. While the apostles were still on the earth, engaged in the proclamation of the truth concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, that anti-Christ was busy deceiving the people and inducing them to follow religious teachers. Who would be specially interested in denying that Jesus is the Messiah who Jehovah long ago promised</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">should be the King and ruler of the world? The Devil, of course; and he would be the one that would put it into the minds of men to deny this great truth: “Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.” (1 John 2:22) “And every spirit that con-fesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.”—1 John 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• “Christ,” the “Messiah”, means Jehovah’s “Anointed One”, his King and rightful Ruler of the world and the One who shall destroy Satan’s wicked rule. Every thing and every institution that denies that great truth is a part of the antichrist. Every thing and every institution that is not for Jehovah God and Christ Jesus is against the Lord and against his kingdom. Jesus not only magnified the kingdom, but also said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” (Matt. 12:30) Every religious institution today extols and magnifies creatures and keeps the people in ignorance of the kingdom of Christ which will vindicate the name of Jehovah God. Religion puts the state even above God and his kingdom. Religion is therefore the chief means employed to deceive the people and oppose Christ, and religion is wholly anti-Christ and anti-God. The influential politicians in these latter days publicly proclaim: “We need more religion”; at the same time exerting their power and influence against the kingdom of God under Christ. All the facts show that religion is anti-God and anti-Christ and hence anti-God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The “remnant” and the Lord’s “other sheep” now see that the kingdom is of paramount importance. We see that every Christian must be for Christ and for the kingdom under Christ and must obey the commandments of God, and therefore must be against religion. All faithful servants of God will now keep in mind the wicked challenge of Satan in which he declared that he could turn men away from and cause them to curse God; that God accepted that challenge and declared that he would permit Satan full time and opportunity to carry out his wicked challenge before God exhibits his supreme power against that enemy. (Job 2:1-6; Ex. 9:16) The issue therefore arrays Satan and all his forces against God and against his King, Christ Jesus. From the time of Eden until now Satan has fought against God and his kingdom. Because of this issue the kingdom is stressed by all the writers of the Bible. Those faithful men of old wrote prophecy under inspiration of the spirit of Jehovah God and have magnified the importance of the kingdom. Seeing, then, that it is Satan that leads the wicked forces against God and against Christ Jesus, who, then, are the enemies against whom the followers of Christ Jesus fight? Who are the ones that seek to destroy those who serve Jehovah? Is it possibly true that Christians must fight against flesh and blood, as religionists would have them believe? Satan and his forces arc unseen to men, and it is these unseen forces that battle against Jehovah’s King and kingdom and all who represent the kingdom. Therefore the apostle under inspiration of the spirit of God instructed the followers of Christ Jesus concerning their enemies in these words: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6:12) Thus it is seen that the enemy against whom the anointed of the Lord fight is not those of flesh and blood, but the enemy is made up of the Devil and his host of wicked angels, who use human creatures as their tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> In this day the issue is sharply drawn because it is the time when Jehovah is doing his “strange work”, which work consists of informing the people that religion is of the Devil; and because it is of the Devil, and the means used by him to deceive the people, religion is doomed to early and complete destruction. Those who sincerely desire to know and to serve God and who now see the truth and have an understanding thereof clearly appreciate the issue that they must be against religion and must be for the kingdom, and that there is no middle ground. Discerning that religion is against God and against his kingdom enables them to see that religion is man’s enemy and the Devil’s chief instrument to use against men. That is the reason why so many persons of good will now are appearing upon the scene and declaring themselves against religion and for the kingdom of God under Christ. They clearly see that Jehovah's wit nesses are not engaged in any fight against human creatures, but that they are carrying on and carry ing forward a good work by proclaiming the message of God according to his commandments; and for this reason those persons of good will hasten to join the anointed remnant in that “strange work”. All who are on the side of Jehovah and his King must of necessity stand firmly together and work faithfully and harmoniously together, because they have a com mon purpose and a common interest, and that is to serve God and his King and to receive God’s ap proval. Necessarily then, the Devil and all his agen cies, and particularly religion and religionists, oppose God and oppose Jehovah’s witnesses ami their companions. The time must come when God would manifest and express his wrath against religions and that time has come. He sends forth his witnesses to declare his truth, which exposes religion as the in strument of the Devil, fighting against God’s kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Long ago Jehovah by his prophet Joel emphasized the harmonious and forward action of his faithful people on the earth. He shows that his anointed ones and their companions would stand shoulder to shoulder, working for the kingdom. He likens his faithful anointed ones unto locusts (Joel 1:4; 2: 25) and calls them “his army”, who have no earthly king but who are under the leadership of Christ, the heavenly King. God’s faithful and loyal ones now on the earth do not need an earthly or visible king, head or ruler. They are all at unity; meaning they are all at one, and that Christ is their Leader and Head. Christ Jesus denounced religion as of the Devil, and they must follow their Head and Leader. Note now the prophecy of Joel, which discloses the harmonious movement of Jehovah’s faithful servants, who follow their King whithersoever he leads: “Neither shall one thrust another [nor against each other shall they strike </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)],</span><span class="font4"> they shall walk every one in his path; and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.”—Joel 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> They have no occasion to fight one another. If they are found fighting with one another, that would be proof conclusive that they are not serving God and his King. They inarch forward in unity. They do not get out of line with one another. They do not try to mind the other fellow’s business, nor to interfere with another in the discharge of his assigned duty. Each one knows his assigned position and duty and is diligent to faithfully serve where he is put. All keep themselves in the peace of God and maintain their full peace and harmony amongst themselves, just as God foretold his faithful ones must do. (Psalm 122) The Authorized Version does not give the clearest understanding here of Joel’s prophecy, which, according to the Revised Version, reads: “They burst through the weapons, and break not off their course.” According to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font4"> “Though in among the weapons they fall, they shall not stop.” Note here the indisputable facts in harmony with and in fulfillment of the prophecy, as stated. The legislative bodies enact laws to stop the activity of God’s people. The courts construe those laws to try to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The strong-arm squad, acting at the behest of the religious leaders, inflict punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses, assault them, beat them, throw them into filthy prisons, falsely accuse them of crime, and otherwise ill-treat them. The religious leaders incite mobs of violent persons to assault Jehovah’s witnesses, and, as Jesus foretold, Jehovah’s witnesses are fiiated of all nations of the world for his name’s sake’. (Matt. 24:9) None of these things stop the onward march of Jehovah’s faithful servants. They realize that their commission and authority is from Almighty God, and so they are determined to obey God regardless of what men may say or do. Some of Jehovah’s witnesses are cruelly subjected to bodily punishment, and some have actually been murdered by the religious representatives of Satan. Such things, however, do not deter others from going forward in their work. The surviving ones do not cry and weep because one of their fellow witnesses is killed by the enemy, for the reason that they know that such as die faithful are immediately changed into the glorious likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ. No human power or Devil power can stay the onward march of Jehovah’s army, whom he likens unto locusts. They are for the King and his kingdom. They know that the King will be victorious. They are determined by His favor and the grace of Almighty God to be faithful in the full performance of their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Further describing the activities of the faithful witnesses of the Lord, his prophet records: “They shall run to and fro in the city [they leap upon the city (R.F.)] ; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.”—Joel 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The faithful and zealous witnesses of Jehovah invade the places held by Satan’s agents, that is, in the organizations called “churches” or religious institutions, where the “prisoners” are held. The religionists, by coercion and threats, put fear into the minds of many of their parishioners and hold them in restraint. Jehovah’s witnesses hasten to carry the message of the kingdom to such prisoners, that they may learn of God’s provision for their escape to freedom and find a place of safety. Not only are the witnesses of Jehovah proclaiming his name and his kingdom, but they are doing a good work toward those who sigh and cry because of the restraint that is put upon them and the abominations that are practiced in the religious organizations.—Ezek. 9: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The combined elements, which constitute the visible rulers of the “present evil world”, erect what they call “legal walls” by enacting laws to prevent anyone from speaking against religion. They enact laws or ordinances forbidding the advertising of the truth by banners or other means, thus discriminating against Jehovah’s witnesses. These so-called “legal walls” do not cause Jehovah’s witnesses to stop their work, nor are they frightened at the sight of such walls. Knowing that God has commanded his work to be done, and he having promised that the enemy shall not prevail against his faithful ones, those witnesses of Jehovah go straight ahead, trusting implicitly in the Lord and doing with their might what he has given them to do. “They shall climb up upon the houses.” God’s faithful servants go from house to house to bring the message of the kingdom to those who reside there, omitting none, not even the houses of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and there they give witness to the kingdom because they are commanded by the Most High to do so. “They shall enter in at the windows like a thief.” They do not loot nor break into the houses, but they set up their phonographs before the doors and windows and send the message of the kingdom right into the houses into the ears of those who might wish to hear; and while those desiring to hear are hearing, some of the “sour-pusses” are compelled to hear. Locusts invade the homes of the people and even eat the varnish off the wood and eat the wood to some extent. Likewise God’s faithful witnesses, likened unto locusts, get the kingdom message right into the house and they take the veneer off the religious things that are in that house, including candles and “holy water”, remove the superstition from the minds of the people, and show them that the doctrines that have been taught to them are wood, hay and stubble, destructible by fire, and they cannot withstand the heat. The people are enabled to learn that “purgatory” is a bogeyman, set up by the agents of Satan to frighten the people into the religious organizations, where they may be fleeced of their hard-earned money. Thus the kingdom message plagues the religionists, and the clergy find that they are unable to prevent it. Therefore, as described by the prophet, the message comes to them like a thief that enters in at the windows, and this message is a warning to those who are on the inside that Jesus Christ has come, and they remember his warning words, to wit: “Behold, I come as a thief.” (Rev. 16:15) The day of Armageddon is very close, and that day comes upon the world in general like a thief in the night. (1 Thess. 5:2) To be sure, the Lord sees the efforts on the part of religionists to prevent his message from reaching the people, and he laughs at them and has such opponents in derision. The work that is now being done is God’s work, his “strange work”, and no power can stop it. God will finish it in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Satan, having been cast out of heaven and down to earth, where he now operates in defiance of God and his kingdom, is desperately fighting against those who serve Jehovah, and he brings into action all his wicked spirits, attempting in every possible way and by every possible means to thwart the proclamation of the kingdom. Here at the earth the battle of truth is being fought and is carried on against the errors of religion, and it is shaking the religious institutions to the foundation. “The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.”—Joel 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Satan’s visible organization, religious, political and commercial, is now in a state of fear and trepidation, and the organization is quaking and trembling. The leaders thereof are enraged and are shaken at the sound of the message of God’s kingdom, and in their desperation they resort to every possible means to stop it. The enemy tried to destroy the Lord’s work during the World War, but after the war the witness work was revived and soon thereafter the “strange work” began in earnest. “And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand; and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.”—Rev. 11:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The Lord is now in command of his faithful witnesses, and the earthly governments are giving evidence of how they are quaking by enacting laws and making orders in council to prevent the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. In some of the more benighted places they are preventing the importation of the kingdom message in the form of books, phonographs, records and magazines; yet the witnesses go straight on telling the people about it, and the efforts of the enemy cause the honest and sincere people to search out the reason for the opposition, and thus they are enabled to find the way of escape. Towns and states enact ordinances specifically directed against Jehovah’s witnesses, and judges and magistrates of some of the courts have exploded in anger from the judicial bench in words like these: “These Jehovah people come in here like a swarm of locusts, showing no respect for our ordinances nor for our churches.” Certain towns in Connecticut and New Jersey are striking examples of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Seeing the inability of the police to stop the witness work, the ecclesiastics tremble in rage and fear. Then the Devil and his host of wicked angels tremble and are viciously moved in their efforts to stop the work by Jehovah’s witnesses. Satan and his host of wicked spirits in high places constitute the “heavens”, meaning the invisible part now operating at the earth against God’s kingdom and his people. It is Satan and his angels that carry on the war against Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make wai’ with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> These scriptures and facts are exactly in harmony with the words of the apostle Paul at Ephesians 6:12, which show conclusively that the warfare of God’s faithful witnesses on earth is against the Devil and his host of wicked angels and that the Devil and those wicked angels use human creatures as visible agents to carry on their vicious work of opposition. This ought to convince any reasonable person, and certainly anyone who has the truth, that the kingdom of God under Christ is the most important of all things, because that kingdom will wipe out Satan’s organization and will vindicate the name of Jehovah and provide means for salvation for those who love righteousness. So understanding, those who love the Lord should be so enthused that they would want to increase their energies in looking after the kingdom interests and doing all within their power to make known the kingdom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘•During the past few months the number of the witnesses in the field has greatly increased, because more Jonadabs have learned of God’s kingdom and have joined the remnant in the service; and their increased activities have brought more fear upon the religionists and caused them to express their anger in a more vicious manner. 'The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.’ When the plague of locusts was upon Egypt (Ex. 10:15), &quot;they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees.” That pictured the plague that is now upon “Christendom”. The big clergymen, and the principal ones of their flocks, are the ones symbolically represented as “the sun and the moon” and the shining “stars”, and their ardent parishioners regard them as “the lights of the world”; but now their light is being very much obscured by the message of Jehovah’s kingdom proclaimed by his army of antitypical locusts. God’s message of truth is now informing the honest people that their hope is not in religious leaders, nor in the principal ones of their flock, but that their only hope is in Christ Jesus and his kingdom; and that truth shuts off the light from the big moguls of “Christendom”. To the honest and sincere people of today the words of Jehovah concerning Christ Jesus sound out with great encouragement, to wit: “In his name shall the nations hope.” (Matt. 12:21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font4"> margin) Thus it is seen that the truth makes dark the light of the clergymen, and the truth shines upon and brightens some of the sin-sick world. Jehovah’s “strange work” gives no glory or honor to men or to any creatures of the world. It is as the Lord has said through his apostle: “Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?” (1 Cor. 1:20) The worldly bright-lights are overshadowed and their shining grows less as the message of the kingdom is carried forward. Even the political leaders that have been shining lights amongst men for some time have yielded to Satan’s seductive influence and have turned to religion, calling out loudly for “more religion”, and their former bright shining as political leaders is disappearing. Jehovah’s army of “locusts” moves steadfastly onward, and while the darkness increases upon the worldly-wise the light upon the Lord’s people continues to increase to their joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Is the campaign now carried on for the glory of Jehovah’s witnesses ? Not by any means. It is the message of God, and he only should and does receive the honor and glory. “And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army [before his host </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)];</span><span class="font4"> for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?”—Joel 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> By Christ Jesus his King and through his theocratic organization Jehovah roars forth his message proclaiming to all creation that the day of final reckoning is at hand. This is not for the purpose of exalting or praising the “locusts”, his witnesses, but for the express purpose of informing the people that the Almighty God is Jehovah. The “locusts” have no earthly king, but they are under their heavenly King, Christ Jesus, who commands them. He is invisible to human eyes, and he commands and leads the host of the Most High. It is the “voice” of Jehovah uttered by his duly authorized and commissioned Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. (1 Thess. 4:16,17) “His camp is very great”; that is, very numerous as respects the volume of the message that the Lord sends forth and that his camp puts out. It is the utterance of Jehovah, and it is his “strange work”, and he is very strong and he uses his campers to carry on his work regardless of opposition. Soon he will finish that work and will prove that he has found men on earth who will maintain their integrity toward him under pressure from the enemy. This is Jehovah’s day, and “the day of the Lord is great and very terrible”. The first part of the day of Jehovah is occupied with his “strange work” of proclaiming the message of his vengeance against religion and hypocrisy and announcing that his kingdom is the only hope of mankind. The judgment of the world has begun and is progressing, and the nations are now being separated, and all this must be done prior to Armageddon, and with Armageddon Satan’s organization shall cease.—Matt. 25:31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> The question is then propounded by the prophet: “And who can abide it?” that is, Who can maintain his integrity and abide as a member of God’s organization, whether said to be of the remnant or of the “other sheep”? It is a time of great test upon each and every one who has undertaken to do the will of God. Those who do abide in this day and prove their integrity are the ones who have full faith and confidence in God and in his King and who march forward in obedience to his commandments, regardless of the opposition on the part of the foe. These faithful ones now fully appreciate the fact that their fight is not against human creatures, not against men because such men are Catholics or Protestants or Jews, or non-believers in anything (they are not fighting against human power or human governments), but that they are being assaulted and opposed by the Devil and his host of wicked angels, and that such invisible ones are using men to carry out their wicked works, and that men thus used are the ones who have yielded to religion and thereby have been seduced by Satan. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses and “his camp” is to obey God and magnify his name that the people may learn their only means of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING HIS PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Many centuries ago, and in the days of his typical people, Jehovah caused the prophecy of Joel to be uttered. Up to this point in the prophecy God tells of hypocritical religion, and of his purpose to destroy religion. He knew the end from the beginning, and in due time God informs his covenant people as to the meaning of the prophecy and what their duty is at this time. By his prophet Jehovah now addresses those who have made a covenant to do his will and to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Religion is Satan’s chief means of turning men away from God, and the warning from Jehovah to his covenant people is that they must put away now everything pertaining to religion and give themselves wholly and without reservation to his service. “Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”—Joel 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> This part of the prophecy appears to have the beginning of its fulfillment in completeness shortly before the beginning of God’s “strange work”, that is, between the years A.D. 1918 and 1922. Long before that time God had caused his prophets to utter his judgment against religion and to foretell his “strange work” and what would be the effect on religion. His covenant people during the “Elijah period” of the church, and prior thereto, were walking with the religionists and had imbibed many religious formalisms and practices. It was difficult for them to get away from something that they did not understand was against God. The time came for them, however, to separate themselves completely from the religious institutions. While walking with religionists the condition of God’s covenant people was such that, figuratively speaking, they were clothed with filthy garments, which filth they had gathered upon them by association with the Babylonish religious systems and giving honor to high dignitaries in such organizations. The time came when they must be cleansed, and the Lord said to them: “And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.”—Zech. 3:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The “Refiner’s fire” and “Fuller’s soap” did the cleansing work when the Lord came to his temple and began judgment. (Mal. 3:1-3) All those who stood before the Lord at the temple judgment are of necessity included in the foregoing admonition to forsake everything pertaining to the world and turn wholly to the Lord. Therefore Jehovah through his prophet says: “Turn ye even to me with all your heart.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Prior to that God’s covenant people were trying to develop character, and that in such perfect form that Jehovah could approve them; that is to say, they were trying to grow up to perfection by their own efforts. They had been taught and believed that a Christian must so deport himself that he would have the approval of worldly people who looked upon him; that he must recognize the state as the “higher powers”; and that he must be careful to cause no offense to religionists, and particularly to the high dignitaries in the religious organization. The vindication of Jehovah’s name was unknown to those of the Elijah period, and the kingdom was a secondary matter to be looked forward to. Most of those of the Elijah period were looking forward to their resurrection change, when they would be taken to heaven to &quot;help rule mankind and restore them’. In due time God revealed to his covenant people that such a course of action is not the proper one; that they must not bestow honor upon men; that it is impossible for these to bring themselves to perfection, but that their sufficiency before him is in Christ Jesus, their Head and perfect guide; and that each and every one must wholly turn himself to and obey the Lord’s commandments in support of the kingdom. (Isa. 6:1-9) These truths began to be revealed to his people after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. His witnesses must be equipped, and therefore they must forsake religion. They must recognize God and Christ Jesus as the only “Higher Powers”. They must put away the fear of men and really fear God. The filth upon their garments, received while in Babylon, must be put away, and this they would do by separating themselves entirely from the Babylonish systems and devoting themselves exclusively to God’s kingdom; and, thus cleansing their garments, they would be identified as for God and for his kingdom. Because of Babylonish practices the covenant people of Jehovah had been brought into a snare and, in a measure, made captives and prisoners by the enemy. God’s word addressed to typical Israel now became appropriately applied to spiritual Israel, to wit: “0 Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.”—Hos. 14:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Those gathered at the temple and who receive the Lord’s approval must show their love exclusively for God and for his kingdom. (Deut. 6: 5, 6; 1 John 5:3) They must turn to God “with all your heart [devotion], and with fasting, and with weeping”, because of the iniquity received in Babylon, and henceforth they must abstain from indulging the flesh according to religion, in order that proper service and worship might be rendered unto Jehovah God. “Fasting and weeping” would mean refraining from everything religious, because religion dishonors God’s holy name and is a reproach to his people. Mourning because of their past iniquity shows that his servants are in a right attitude toward Jehovah God and in a position to receive his blessings and approval. “Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.” (Matt. 5: 4) The Lord does comfort and has comforted all of Zion who have turned entirely, wholly and completely to him, who have turned away from religion, and who have unhestitatingly exposed religion and declared themselves unequivocally and without compromise for Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Such turning to the Lord must not be a formal matter, but must be done sincerely and truly, and in order to receive God’s approval his servants must see and appreciate that the issue that is now to be settled is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and that it is the most important thing; that therefore the kingdom is the most important doctrine because the means by which Jehovah vindicates his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The Lord does not command that his people shall go about in grief and sorrow before the world, nor even before one another. Note he says through his prophet: “And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.”—Joel 2:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Outward signs of grief would count for nothing and could not be pleasing to God when indulged in that others might look upon such action. True sorrow of heart because of failure to do God’s will is manifested by the creature towards Jehovah, and not for the purpose of being seen by men. There must be a truly contrite spirit, that is, a genuine heart-sorrow because of failure in the past to show complete devotion to God and his kingdom. (Ps. 51:17,18) There must be a true inward sorrow, which the Lord alone sees; for he is the one whose approval must be had and enjoyed. The snare into which God’s sincere people had fallen was due to the religious influence about them and because of their own negligence and fear of creatures. When God revealed to them the plight in which they were, the sincere ones were truly sorrowful and ashamed. They turned to the Lord, and his mercy was shown unto them. “For he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness.” The Lord must have a cleansed people, who would offer unto him an offering in righteousness, and those who were truly devoted to God when being judged at the temple received his mercy: “Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line [of constructive work] shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem [Jehovah’s visible organization, which had been desolated in 1918 by the efforts of the enemy].”—Zech. 1:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> It is not the will of God that his sincere servants shall perish, but that they should turn to him when they see the right way, and, doing so readily, receive his blessings: “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”— 2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> God was angry with the erring ones during 1918, but when the faithful ones saw their condition they speedily sought the face of Jehovah, and that with true and sincere sorrow of heart. Then the Lord showed his mercy to such and filled their mouth with praise for him, and this he foretold by his prophet Isaiah (12:1,2): “And in that day thou shalt say, 0 Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou com-fortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font4"> JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.” Instead of destroying the sincere yet erring ones when the Lord came to his temple, he cleansed them, and then Jehovah “shortened” the day of tribulation for their sake, affording them an opportunity to prove their love for him. (Matt. 24:21,22) The destruction of “Christendom” was postponed or delayed that the “elect” might have full opportunity to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah before “Christendom” and might therefore have a part in doing God’s “strange work”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> God could not approve these sincere hearing ones unless such hearing ones, when informed of their mistake, would be diligent to repent and seek his face with prayer and fasting and sincere heart-sorrow: “Who knoweth if he will return [(I?.P.) whether he will not turn] and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering, and a drink offering, unto the Lord your God?”—Joel 2:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> The faithful remnant did obey God’s admonition to turn to him wholly and to avoid religion and shun it, and now they have the proof from the Lord that their course was right and they know that God did turn away from them destruction and hence did change his course of action and cleanse and purify the remnant and reinstated them in his service and did make them his witnesses. Those who held to religion and religious practice could not have God’s blessing, and such fell into the “evil servant” class. Jehovah’s “strange work”, as pictured by the locust plague, could not be stopped and set aside, but its coming did not do evil to the faithful remnant, but afforded great blessings to them by giving them a part in Jehovah’s “strange work”. “Christendom” did not repent, and therefore God sends upon “Christendom” his army of “locusts” that engage in his “strange work”, which results in destroying the food and the pasture of the religionists. God having given his witnesses, the “locusts”, a part in his “strange work” as stated in the prophecy, he has ‘left behind him blessings’ since 1922, and such blessings as had not been enjoyed by his people before. “A meat [meal] offering, and a drink offering, unto the Lord your God,” has been graciously provided by Jehovah for his faithful servants that they might serve him in verity and offer to him an offering in righteousness. (Mal. 3: 3) No one else has received such blessings from the Lord. As Jehovah’s witnesses go forward in the strength of the Lord, having a part in his “strange work”, their blessings continue to increase and their joy is greatly enlarged.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CALL TO ACTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> The “Elijah work” came to an end in 1918, and the consecrated throughout the earth reached a state of inactivity for some time. In the year 1919, and shortly after the removal of their restraint and their release from captivity, God’s consecrated people began to awaken to the necessity of busying themselves, and this without doubt was due to the fact that the Lord was directing them; and this is shown by the words of his prophet: “Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly.” (Joel 2:15) Zion (referring to God’s organization, and including the visible part thereof on earth) awakened. That blowing of the trumpet in Zion was for the good of God’s released and restored spiritual Israelites, his “remnant” on the earth, and did not call at that time for the activity concerning the “great multitude”. The time had arrived for God’s people to become active, and the call went forth for immediate action. The Society sounded the alarm from the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and a solemn assembly was called. That call was to renewed activity in Jehovah’s service with that fearlessness that had been pictured long ago by the prophet Elisha. In the face of great opposition and much reproach the faithful witnesses of Jehovah responded with joy and zeal to that call, and in 1922 the witness work began in a really organized, systematic and increased manner.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MINUTE INSTRUCTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Among the strongest proofs that Jehovah is guiding his people in the way they should go is that shown when Jehovah uses them to fulfill his prophecy and then afterwards gives them an understanding of the prophecy, and reveals to his people that they have been so used. During the World War God’s servants on the earth were broken up and scattered by the enemy, particularly the religious element thereof. They must be regathered and enter the service of Jehovah, and the prophecy of Joel shows God’s guiding hand in this matter. (Joel 2:16) In the year 1919 the servant class began to be gathered together and to prepare to devote themselves with renewed zeal to the service of the Lord, and therefore to be a sanctified company, set aside for the exclusive service of Jehovah. “Assemble the old men.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> That instruction could not refer to the “elective elders”, but manifestly refers to those more mature ones amongst the Lord’s people, and which elsewhere are pictured by Mordecai and Naomi and who remained faithful under the test imposed upon them during the World War. “Gather the children,” says the prophecy; and that seems to apply to the younger ones coming into the servant class and who were pictured by Esther and Ruth, and who were added to the “faithful servant” class from and after 1922. Incidentally this instruction shows the will of God concerning minor children, that they should be brought along to the meeting or assembly place with the older ones and there hear and learn about God’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> The admonition or instruction of the Lord applies to every one of the consecrated, regardless of position in the organization. Note that the prophecy says “the bridegroom” and “the bride” must go forth. Symbolically this means all those who have entered into the marriage relationship then must not permit that to be any excuse for inactivity in the service. The fact that one is the husband and the other is the wife is no justification or excuse to remain out of the service. When a person makes a covenant to do the will of God, that covenant takes precedence over all other covenants, whether made before or after consecration. The marital relationship will not excuse one from fulfilling his or her covenant to serve Jehovah, because the covenant with Jehovah is of paramount importance. The kingdom has come; and to announce the King, who will vindicate Jehovah’s name, is the privilege and duty of everyone who has taken the vow of consecration. To those who have agreed to follow Jesus he says: “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.”—Luke 14:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> With stronger force those words apply today to those who are in a covenant to do God’s will. To beseech the brethren, who have made a consecration, to make good that covenant by entering into the service and to zealously engage in the work of the Lord, is the privilege of each one of the remnant. The apostle Paul did that very thing: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” —Rom. 12:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Some amongst the consecrated were inclined to think that because of their position and standing in the congregation they should not engage in the house-to-house witness work, but that their part was chiefly to make speeches and to serve at meetings. But note the instruction of the Lord through his prophet concerning such: “Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?”—Joel </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font4">17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>87</sup> The priests and ministers here mentioned picture all in line for the royal priesthood; and all of these, having been brought into the temple, must now offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness, to wit, “the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” (Heb. 13:15) Regardless of the position occupied, no consecrated one could be excused from the guilt and fault of God’s people, nor from sorrow from reproach upon His name, nor from praying for the vindication of His name. All were guilty who had been thus negligent, and all were admonished to weep and to show real sorrow and a contrite heart for the neglect or lack of zeal in making known the name of the Most High. Not that they should magnify themselves, but that they should show a real and genuine desire to magnify the name of Jehovah and make known that his kingdom is here. Then says the prophet : “Spare thy people, O Lord.” They were instructed to cry thus openly and admitting guilt, negligence, or failure to perform service under adverse conditions. The keenest interest of the consecrated must be in the kingdom and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. God had taken out from the nations a “people for his name”, which consecrated people constituted the heritage of the Lord; and so these were instructed to pray to God: “Give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen [religionists who do not serve God] should [use a by-word against </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)]</span><span class="font4"> them [should mock them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)].”</span><span class="font4"> If God should send a plague upon his people the religionists would mock. They mock God by denying his existence and by saying: “God is not all-powerful; hence his people suffer.” It was necessary for the “faithful servant” class to be shown mercy and to be recovered from the erring way, and particularly from religion and religious practice, that they might avoid the plague that was coming, which has now come upon “Christendom”, and that they might be servants to the honor and praise of Jehovah. In harmony with this God put in the mouth of his consecrated people this prayer, which they pray: “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight, by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die: and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.”—Ps. 79: 9-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The admonition and instruction from the Lord, set out in the prophecy, is not for any selfish reason, but for the well-being of God’s covenant people, that they may be in a proper condition of mind and heart to serve Jehovah as they have agreed to do. If the servant class would follow the course marked out for them and would repent and reform and get busy to carry out their covenant, Jehovah would safeguard the interests of his people and prosper them; and such was the promise of the Lord: “Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people.” —Joel 2:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>89</sup> Those who were approved at the temple judgment and taken into God’s organization, forming the remnant of his anointed, did repent and reform, and then Jehovah did show, and continues to show, his loving-kindness for them, and these are represented in the last-quoted prophecy as “his land”. God delivered them from being prisoners of Satan’s crowd and took away from them the fear of man. He opened the way for the remnant to enter fully into his service and to thereafter perform fearlessly his kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Since 1922 the Lord has clearly revealed to his people that their fight is not against the weaknesses of the flesh, nor against flesh-and-blood creatures, but that their fight is against Satan and the host of wicked ones, invisible to human eyes, that have overreached men and used men to set up and operate religious institutions, by and through which they have made war against God’s covenant people. His faithful ones have learned that, in order to withstand the enemy, they cannot rely upon their own ability, but that each one must be fully equipped with the armor of the Lord and rely upon him. The covenant people of God have learned that the time is here for a complete showdown with the Devil’s crowd and that</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SHeWATCHTOWEK</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">therefore this is “the evil day”. The time arrived, therefore, for specific instruction as to what course the anointed should take, and the Lord, through his Word, says to them: “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.” (Eph. 6:13) No time now to ask yourself, What will the people think about me if I go out in the service? No reason now to say, Shall I be able to demonstrate that I have developed a beautiful character and can always be sweet under all conditions? What creatures think of the remnant is not material. How God regards them is of all-importance. Mark well the equipment which the Lord has provided and which he instructs the remnant now to put on: “Having your loins girt about with [the] truth”; that is to say, show that you are a real servant of the truth who is not abashed or ashamed, but who boldly serves God and his King at all times. Put on the “breastplate of righteousness”; that is to say, demonstrate that your heart motive is wholly, entirely and without compromise for Jehovah and his kingdom and that you are pursuing a singleness of purpose to serve God and his kingdom. Have “your feet shod with . . . the gospel of peace”; that is to say, fully equipped to enter upon and go over rough and rocky roads, made so by the enemy, and at all times and under all circumstances of adversity proclaim the good news of ‘peace to those of good will toward God’. Note the fight is not against your fellow creatures. You are not fighting against some earthly institution or men of earth, but contending at all times for the kingdom under Christ, and your only hope is in God and in Christ, and you are warring against the enemies of God and the enemies of his kingdom. Then the admonition is given: “Above all, [take] the shield of faith,” against which the darts of the enemy avail nothing. Faith consists of a knowledge of Jehovah’s expressed purpose and a full and complete reliance upon his Word; and, having that shield, the darts of the enemy cannot deter the faithful servant in performance of duty. The Devil and all his angels cannot convince the remnant that their cause is hopeless. Their confidence and trust is implicitly in God and Christ his King. Furthermore, “Take the helmet of salvation”; that is to say, have an intellectual appreciation of the proper relationship between the remnant and Jehovah God and his kingdom and rely upon God’s Word, knowing that salvation belongeth to Jehovah and that there is no other means of salvation and victory. ‘Take the sword of the spirit, the word of God,’ and use it as the Lord has directed it shall be used. (Vss. 14-17) That means to completely expose the religion of the Devil and his angels, and to do so by pointing out to the people from the Word of God that religion is a snare and a racket, and against God and against his kingdom. Thus equipped with the armor which the Lord has provided for his covenant people, they could not be dismayed by Satan and his agents. Some of the consecrated, when brought before the temple for judgment, failed to obey and to meet the test, but leaned to their own understanding; while some were fully obedient. And now mark what has been the result upon each class.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE FIRST WOE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">W</span><span class="font2">HEN the “bright and morning Star”, Christ Jesus the King, received the key of the bottomless pit and opened the abyss, smoke arose. The record at Revelation 9:1-3 says: “And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.” Verse eleven says that their king was God’s messenger or angel that had the key of the bottomless pit, and that here in this capacity his name in the Hebrew language is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abaddon,</span><span class="font2"> which means “destroyer”; in the Greek the name is Apollyon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Greek word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apollyon</span><span class="font2"> means “destroying one”, and is applied many times in the Scriptures to Jehovah, who is called the destroying One, as at Matthew 10:28; 21:41; Jude 5. If there could be any doubt about this, James settles it when he writes (4:12) : “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy [Greek: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">apollymi]</span><span class="font2"> : who art thou that judgest another?” The overwhelming Scriptural authority, in both the Hebrew and the Greek books of the Bible, applies these titles to Jehovah. Christ Jesus being the chief executive officer of Jehovah, to whom is committed all power in heaven and earth, and being authorized to act as Jehovah’s officer to destroy, the titles “Abaddon” and “Apollyon” therefore properly apply to him. (Num. 24:17-19; Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34) The only reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that Jesus, the glorified King armed for war and having the key to the bottomless pit, is the “king” over the “locusts”. This definitely identifies the “locusts” as members of God’s organization, to wit, the remnant of his faithful witnesses on earth. The day of God’s vengeance against the enemy organization having come, it is appropriate that Jehovah assume the role of Destroyer, that is, Abaddon, or Apollyon (“for our God is a consuming fire”—Hebrews 12:29), which title particularly applies at the time the kingdom of God is being announced. His beloved Son, then, the King, bears the same title, and the title has a special application in the “day of the Lord”, which day began in 1914 A.D. and continues thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The description of the “locusts” shows that they form a part of God’s army, the fighting organization, and therefore proves that the same symbolism refers to the remnant on earth, who “keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ”. (Rev. 12:17) These are the willing volunteers in the day of the Lord’s power. (Ps. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">110: </span><span class="font2">3) John says: “And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle.” (Rev. 9:7) This further identifies them as the same ones who form the Lord’s army as -described by the prophet Joel.—Joel 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The horse is symbolically used in the Scriptures to represent warfare. Jeremiah 8:6: “The horse rusheth into the battle.” God’s remnant now on the earth have taken the offensive. Fearlessly they volunteer and move forward to battle under their Leader and Commander. (Ps. 110:3) Jehovah’s description of the horse, at Job 39:19-22, follows: “Hast thou given the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.” Such is a good description of those who fearlessly follow the Lord Jesus whithersoever he leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Verse 7 further says of the locusts: “On their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men”. This shows that God’s militant remnant is clothed with divine authority to do kingdom work, which is the crowning work of all work now to be done, and their faces as of men symbolize that they are benevolent, loving and kind, and the motive is pure. They reflect God’s image because they represent him. They are not “bald” locusts, such as the Israelites were permitted to eat. (Lev. 11:22) They have not ‘cut off their hair’ for mourning, but are joyful in the Lord and are in the likeness of the Lord Jesus, in this, that, as Revelation 1:14 pictures Him, they have hair. The difference is that they have “hair as the hair of women” (Rev. 9:8), which symbolizes that they arc in subjection to their Head Christ Jesus.—1 Cor. 11:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“And their teeth were as the teeth of lions” (vs. 8) ; showing that they are prepared to eat “strong meat” and are not babes. They are wholly devoted to the Lord God. (1 Cor. 3:1-3; Heb. 5:14; Joel 1:6) “And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron,” therefore unbreakable ones, because they have on “the breastplate of faith and love”, “the breastplate of righteousness,” and arc “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might”. (1 Thcss. 5:8; Eph. 6:12-17) Isaiah 59:17 says: “For he put on righteousness as a breastplate.” They know that they are right and on Jehovah’s side and they fear neither man nor devil. They are the fighting contingent of the Lord’s people, joyfully following their Head and Leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Verse 9 continues: “And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.” When the Lord’s remnant are in action they make a sounding noise which frightens the enemy. Their chief business is to make a joyful noise to the glory of the Lord. This is another proof that they arc of God’s organization. By the use of the radio and especially recorded speeches played on portable phonographs, transcription machines and soundcars, and the millions of books they distribute, they make a great noise; so it is thought by those who are frightened. One real Christian can put to flight a thousand ecclesiastical frauds: “One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one.” (Isa. 30:17) Joel 2: 5 says: “Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When God’s children learned that there is a remnant of spirit-begotten ones on earth to whom the Lord has committed the testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev. 12:17), and that they are the witnesses of Jehovah sent forth to declare his vengeance, it was easy for them to see that the description concerning the “locusts” exactly fits the remnant. It shows that this symbolically represents that division of the Lord’s army which is on earth and which delights to keep the commandments of God. About this there eannot be the slightest doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further describing this militant army of “locusts”, Revelation 9:10 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott</span><span class="font2"> version) says: “And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails was their power to injure men five months.” God is his own interpreter. He says: “The prophet ... be is the tail.” (Isa. 9:15) If the prophet teaches lies, then he is a lying prophet; and if he teaches the truth he is a true prophet. God’s people under Christ Jesus are thus teachers of the truth. (Isa. 55:4) The prophecy or message which they deliver is from the Lord. This exposes Satan and his organization and his agents who teach lies; therefore the message which the locusts leave behind stings, and has power to hurt. It is the message of God’s vengeance. It is the prophecy, “the tail,” that docs the hurting. No physical force is to be used, but the “locusts” (God’s remnant) use their mouths to preach and leave behind the prophecy in printed form, and the message does the hurting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Testimony” or resolution adopted at the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in London, England, in May, 1926, and the accompanying argument in support thereof, set forth that Satan is the god of this world; that the British empire is the seat of his beastly organization ; that the League of Nations is the child of Satan, and its mother is the beastly governments of earth; that God had set his beloved Son upon his throne as earthly rightful King and soon Satan’s organization must go down, and therefore the tottering and impending fall of the world powers. These statements were clearly proved from the Scriptures, or prophecy of God’s Word. The wide publication of this message stung the British imperialists advocating the League of Nations, and all the big men in Satan’s organization were stung and hurt by the prophecy. When more than fifty million copies were put in the hands of the people the stinging continued, and their torment increased “as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man”. Those stung cried out in woe and in bitter indignation. The British press and the clergymen in bitter terms denounced those who had to do with the declaration of this stinging prophecy. The American clergy and public press joined in denouncing the message and the messengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was the first “woe”, and the fact that it is called,a “woe” shows that it must be inflicted by God’s organization upon Satan’s organization; and this is further proof that the locusts represent the Lord’s army. Of this Revelation 8:13 foretold, saying: “Woe to the inhabiters [ruling factors] of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The angels of the Lord were instruments used by him directing his people on earth to give out the message above mentioned at London, and this was the first “woe”; and two more “woes” must follow, as Revelation 9:12 states. This proves that the two remaining trumpets must be woes upon the same organization, which is the enemy of God, and that these woes must be inflicted by God’s organization. God keeps an accurate account of the tormenting message and he shows no quarter to the enemy. His message is a torment to the enemy because they cannot get away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The command given to the locusts (army of the Lord) was that they should not hurt the grass, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but hurt “only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads”; and they were not to kill, but to torment. (Rev. 9:4, 5) Exodus 10:13-15 says that the locusts God sent upon ancient Egypt ate up every green thing. The army of the Lord is differently pictured in The Revelation. Pictured by the “locusts”, they do not come to feed themselves upon the fruits of the labors of others. If these locusts represented the Devil’s agents they would devour everything they could lay hold upon, and particularly those who are sealed by the Lord in their foreheads. (Rev. 12:17) It is only God’s organization that can hurt the feelings of and torment the Devil’s servants. God makes it clear in this prophecy that none of his sealed servants shall be hurt by the locusts, and this is another proof that the locusts represent the army of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A poisonous wound by a scorpion often proves fatal, but these locusts with the power of scorpions were not sent to kill, but they were sent to torment the Devil’s agents for a fixed period of time. The torment began in 1926, the year of the aforesaid London Resolution, and is still going on. Concerning the Devil’s visible organization that take counsel against God and his anointed he says: “Then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his wrath confound them.” (Ps. 2: 5, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font2"> Many instances of the crying out of their torment might be here given if space permitted, but a few are given to prove the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The British and American clergy, through the public press and from their pulpits, set up a dreadful howl following the expose of the League of Nations and other parts of Satan’s organization. Big Business, working under cover with politicians and the clergy, proceeded to monopolize the radio in the lands of Britain, and did practically the same thing in America, although the radio belongs to the Lord. At a hearing before the Federal Radio Commission at Washington, D.C., Big Business was there with all of its power, flanked and supported by politicians and the clergy. The Federal Council of Churches of America put one of its clergymen on the witness stand to support the claim of Big Business. That clergyman was subjected to a cross-examination under which he suffered terrible torment and doubtless wished he might escape by sinking through the floor. He made himself and the organization for which he stands appear ridiculous in the eyes of all present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another agent of Big Business took the witness stand in an effort to show the importance of a monopoly. With great boasting words he told of the attainments of Satan’s organization in the radio business. On cross-examination he was not only made very uncomfortable, but was taunted and tormented to the point that his own action at the time led to a further torment at the hands of his fellow servants of Satan that lasted many months. By his indiscretion he opened the way for the next “woe” to be broadcast by radio and to be forcibly inflicted upon Satan’s organization, and this brought torment to himself and many others of Satan’s organization. They fought among themselves and cursed one another and many others because of their torment. The public press and the clergy especially howled because of what took place. The “five months” of torment mentioned in The Revelation (9:5) evidently means the entire period of time until the other woes have ended, because five is a divine number and here marks a fixed period of time without designating how long in the fulfillment of the prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public press of London devoted much space to an arraignment of those who had had to do with the passing of the resolution and its distribution. It is stated, at Revelation 9: 6, that in the period of torment men “shall desire to die”, or “seek death, and shall not find it”. The Lord’s army is commanded not to kill, therefore the torment must continue; and while the agents of Satan have tried to escape the 'pest’ of the continuous proclamation of the truth of God’s prophecy, they have been unable to do so. “Death” symbolizes a way of escape; but they were unable to find it. They must take their medicine as God has decreed, because, so Jeremiah 25:28 decrees, “it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou [the locusts, God’s representatives] say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ye shall certainly drink.” They tried for a time to be dead (indifferent) to the strong truths brought by the army of locusts; but that would not work, and then they began to howl because of their torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The British press and the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font2"> and other like papers vented their spleen by repeated assaults upon the people of God. On September 12, 1926, and within five months after the passing of the “Resolution” at London, the London </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express</span><span class="font2"> devoted two columns to a denunciation of the “Testimony” to the world powers and the address supporting it. By so doing it gave a further wide advertisement to the truth. Shortly thereafter the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font2"> the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font2"> and the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font2">supported the British press in an attack upon God’s people. These papers had entered into a contract to advertise a public assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses to be held at Madison Square Garden, New York eity, and then at the last moment repudiated their contract and said unkind things about the Lord’s people. (Sec </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> December 1, 1926.) The torment of these members of Satan’s organization is due wholly to the message of truth, which stings. Although knowing it is the truth, they repent not, but continue to blaspheme God. The army of the Lord, under its King Christ Jesus, continues to sing out the message of truth to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving kindness endureth for ever.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>&quot;BACK TO PALESTINE”? OR TO ZION?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">••T^ROPHESY </span><span class="font2">concerning the land of Israel, . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I-' Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, in my zealousness and in my fury have I spoken, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations: ... 0 mountains of Israel, ye shall send forth your boughs, and your fruit shall ye bear for my people Israel; for they are near at hand to come. And I will multiply upon you men, all the house of Israel.”—Ezekiel 36: 6, 8,10, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There was a partial fulfillment of this prophecy upon Palestine in the days of Ezekiel and Governor Nehemiah, or from 536 B.C. on. (Nehemiah chapters 2-5) The complete, final fulfillment thereof does not apply to the literal land of Palestine, nor to natural Jews according to birth. The natural Jews were evicted from Palestine, in A.D. 70 and thereafter, and, as the Messiah said to them, 'Their house [of religion] was left unto them desolate,’ because they rejected the beloved and anointed King of Jehovah, to wit, Christ Jesus, “which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.” (Matt. 23 :38; Rom. 1:3) To this day the Jews have not as a people repented of this wrongful act committed by their forefathers. For this, however, they may not and should not be persecuted. Many Jews have now been returned to the literal land of Palestine, but have been induced to go there because of selfishness, whether of selfpreservation or otherwise, and for sentimental reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the long period elapsing from A.D. 70 to the present day the Jews, although suffering, have not fulfilled Ezekiel’s prophecy and “borne the reproach of the nations”, that is, not for Jehovah’s sake, nor for the name of Christ. The once Jewish religionist, Paul, writing later as an apostle, sets forth the rule that “he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit”. (Rom. 2:29) So during all the period of exile of natural Jews from Palestine, and particularly during the persecutions of the World War, of 1914-1918, it has been the true Jews, inwardly, to wit, the true followers of Christ Jesus who are devoted to God and to his theocratic government under Christ, that have been bearing the reproach of the nations. As Christ Jesus foretold: “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake,” and for the sake of Jehovah’s name. (Matt. 24:9; Mark 13:13) In contrast with this, during the World War the natural Jews received recognition of the heathen or nations, Great Britain, the United States, etc. In 1917 the Balfour Declaration, sponsored by the “heathen” governments of this world (Satan’s organization), came forth, recognized the Jews as a people, and bestowed upon them great favors. In this Great Britain took the lead. Now Big Business and other wings of Satan’s organization place the natural Jews alongside of and in the same classification as the Gentiles or “heathen”, as Catholics, Protestants and Jews work together to defend religion. Furthermore, the fact should not be overlooked that the affairs of God’s kingdom with reference to the things of earth are of far greater importance than the rehabilitation of that little strip of land on the eastern side of the Mediterranean sea. Therefore Ezekiel’s prophecy must have its chief fulfillment upon spiritual Israel, the true people of Jehovah’s kingdom who are now on the earth and who arc of and for Zion, which is Jehovah’s capital organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the World War spiritual Israel was trodden down by the enemy, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in par-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">239</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">ticular, and the Kingdom interests committed to Jehovah’s servants were scattered and desolated. (Dan. 8:11-13) Ezekiel’s prophecy constitutes a promise of Jehovah to revive and reorganize this spiritual people and set them in their native condition, symbolized by the land of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Their “native condition” is the condition of being occupied in the service of the interests of the theocratic kingdom, in order that the Kingdom interests might flourish and prosper on the earth. The facts since 1919 show fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecy upon spiritual Israel, that is, the people of Jehovah now on the earth anointed with his spirit to be his witnesses. Since the World War God has caused his King, Christ Jesus at his temple, to revive his witness work and also his consecrated people in behalf of the interests of his kingdom. In many lands companies of faithful witnesses have been formed and organized for active service amongst the people and are serving the Kingdom interests. New “plantations” in the form of branch offices, factories for printing Kingdom literature, and organizations for witness work have been established in many parts of the earth and are carrying forward the Kingdom work, in the face of great opposition and persecution by totalitarian forces. Jehovah’s people have pushed forward, and eaeh year he has blessed their efforts by a wider publication of his name and of his kingdom by means of the printed page, by portable phonographs and sound-cars and boats, and by radio. The work in behalf of those symbolized by the “desolate places”, to wit, the “great multitude” of people of good will, whether Jew or Gentile, Catholic, Protestant, or nonsectarian, is progressing and the name of Jehovah and his purpose are being made known to those who have been held as “prisoners” by the religious organizations and the totalitarian powers. This work of laying the foundation of the New Earth (Isa. 51:16) is a more important work than the bringing of some natural Jews back to the land of Palestine. Why should Jehovah God give any favorable attention to such Jews as continue to defame his name and to reject his Messiah, Christ Jesus, the Head of Zion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Not for your sake do I this, 0 house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye are gone. And I will take you from among the nations, and I will gather you out of all the countries, and I will bring you unto your own land.” (Ezekiel 36:22,24, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser)</span><span class="font2"> So the paramount issue is, Who is God? Does the name of Jehovah stand for a supreme and intelligent power? Who shall rule the universe? The issue must now be settled and the name of God made known to all creation. Therefore he says: “I do . . . for mine holy name’s sake.” Do what? Does returning of the natural descendants of Israel to Palestine vindicate the name of Jehovah God? It certainly does not; especially since they have returned there in unbelief. On the other hand, the restoring of his faithful remnant of spiritual Israel to their proper position as his true and bold witnesses after the World War, and his causing them to declare his name and his kingdom fearlessly and boldly, is for his own holy name’s sake and is for the vindication of his name. It is not for the benefit of the remnant, but is that the name of Jehovah God may be made known and be put in its proper place in the minds of all persons of good will, that they may know that He is the Supreme One, from whom they must get life by his Messiah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Most of our back-call work is among Ukrainians (most of whom are or have been Catholics), playing the lecture series ‘Exposed’ and ‘Religion and Christianity’ in Ukrainian, not too many at a time, to give them a better chance to assimilate them. It is interesting to see how prejudice is breaking down. The Drebit family would not let the publisher play in their home. Later Mr. D. was present when a publisher played at another home. Mrs. D. was present at still another home when a publisher was playing. Result: The publisher is now playing the series in the Drebit home. Another Ukrainian refused to let the publisher come into his home. Later she played at his neighbor’s and he heard the records there. When the publisher next called at the neighbor’s to play further records, the neighbor hurried over to tell the Ukrainian and he and his wife came to hear. Another family near by, on whom the publisher had not yet called, sent word asking how much she would charge to play for them. A lady for whom the publisher played reads Russian as well as Ukrainian, but when offered the Russian literature, she said: ‘No, no 1 I want Ukrainian, so I can lend it to my neighbors.’ ”</span></p>

A Roman Catholic priest that comes around to visit the Indians, called ‘Father’ Bugol, when I try to place one with him, said: ‘No, I got more books, that I can’t get to read them.’ One lady that took one told me afterwards: ‘Them little books you sold were good little books.

<p><span class="font2">“He would go to the door, set the phonograph on the doorstep, ready for use, and ring the doorbell.

It was suggested she go and get 25c worth of canned goods on credit, which she did. The result was that she got the bound book and the booklets. We arranged for a back-call to play the lecture series. To me, the outstanding feature was that the zone servant did very little talking. My trouble had been that I was talking too much.

<p><span class="font2">“We went to the compound and started work as usual. Just a few minutes later one publisher was detained by compound police boy and the books taken from him. They sent for me. I spoke to the policeman that it was not necessary for us to obtain his permission to do our work: for preaching God’s kingdom message one need not report to the authorities, because he is a peace messenger. Our friend was released, and we went on with the work. In less than twenty minutes two publishers were arrested by Lieut. Petros of ‘Salvation Army’ with assistance of this same head police boy. They were taken to the owner of the mine. All our bicycles were seized and detained by the mine manager. Another police was sent to arrest me and others. I was taken to the mine office. A very stout, ugly-looking and fierce giant shouted at me: ‘Where is your license to sell these books here?’ I said we are not selling books. ‘Don’t you know the Government has prohibited importation of this type of literature?’ he continued. I said: ‘I received these books from Cape Town in Salisbury last week. They were examined by customs before handing them to me. That Sedition Act of 1936 does not apply to our literature any longer. The Society appealed against it in 1937 and the High Court of Southern Rhodesia decided that Watchtower books are not seditious.’ ‘Do the police know you are out here ?’ he said. I said: ‘It is not necessary for them to know wherever I go, since I am not a criminal.’ He said: ‘I will phone the police to come and arrest you.’ We were kept for about fifteen minutes, during which Salvation Army Lieut. Petros (a native) was standing by scolding us and saying we will get it for interfering with his work in the compound. I told the publishers to keep quiet and not answer him. Sitting outside the office we saw books and booklets, taken from the friends, flying in the air, being thrown out of the office, with a 'Tell them to pick up their books and let them go.’ This man did not like to see me, as he was very ashamed. Of course, the answer from the police was: ‘We have nothing to do with those people.’ We went to our lodgings. Next morning we came back and placed a good amount of literature in this compound. We had the enemies to shame.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“I saw two ladies looking very sad. I briefly introduced the testimony and asked for permission to run the record ‘Instruction’. I was invited into the house to have the phonograph put on a convenient table. While the lecture was on I noticed signs of a better and more joyful facial expression. At the conclusion the mistress of the house remarked: ‘Well, you have been specially sent here today with this very recorded speech to comfort me in this hour of grief. . . . Now hearing that the Watchtower publications offer consolation to the oppressed, and instruction in the way of righteousness to parents and children, I think I shall resort to same.

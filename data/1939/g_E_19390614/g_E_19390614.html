<p><span class="font11">He came down the garden path, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">.a </span><span class="font11">sad, Sorrowful figure. The beautiful girl watched him with anxious eyes. She tried to read the thoughts that were passing in his,troubled mind. When he had come near to her she whispered, “How did father take it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Oh, he took it all right,” replied the young man,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Oh, I am so glad, George!” she cried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Are you?” he replied, flopping forlornly by her side. &quot;Well, I can’t say that I am, dear. At first your father wouldn’t listen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Why didn't you tell him that you have ■ $2,500 in the bank, tike 1 told you?” she demanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I did, after every other argument had failed to convince him that we could afford to get married.” And George bowed his head in utter dejection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;And what did father do then?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Do!” echoed the young man, passing his fingers despairingly through his hair. “He borrowed it!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HIERARCHY’S HITLER</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390614_files/g_E_19390614-3.png" alt="" style="width:41pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE human mind tires of horrors. German terrorism led by Hitler first shocked the decent people bf the world; thcfl, by Ite a mail ng continuance over more than six yean of governmental crime, It hit come to dull and paralyze the emotions. The good people of earth have begun to accept the con»umption of Europe by the Nazi plague the all-tOO-familiar commonplace. In thli.forced acceptance-the hireling press has hod a large responsibility. With Its talons always on the pulfee of world opinion, gauging the International tempo and creating that tempo with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">experienced cunning, it now takes advantage Of this spreading lassitude to present the HIHR-ARCWY'S HITLER in a giamoroui light, the hero of terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In complete control cf the news agencies of the world, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy continues to promote H itier, even In the United Stalls, as a world savior. That he, as well as all the other dictators of Europe, Ej the Hierarchy’s tool is a fact that much simulated Catholic persecution andi other Illi disseminated especially by American newspapers have not succeeded In hiding. The ugly truth, disgusting sv*n to many Catholics In this country, cannot be concealed. Like a shark's fin cleaving the murky waters ef propaganda as It approaches its victim, the American nation, neither Its vicious body nor murderous Intent con be disguised. The fact cannot be disproved nor will any r»ftl effort be made to contradict the statement that Hitler is a staunch Catholic and the ide*l tarvartt of ths pope. (Sae inset bn page 5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICA MAY NO LONGER WARM ITSELF BY THE DYING FIRES OF LIBERTY! THE HIERARCHY'S HITLER MARCHES ONI For long years the pope's promoters In the United Statsi have been preparing the road, and now by columns of newspaper advertisement of Germany's tyrant, and forced flag-Mlutlng, which duplicates the Nazi spirit, the time Is made ripe for taking things Over here. No doubt it will prove an easy matter to later teach /the stiffening Of the arm at the elbow in the salute, and substitute the swastika or an Image of the pope for the flag. These Are mere details. Then the Inquisition will be Invoked and the ravishing cf America, whose flag was once the proud symbol of the land of the free and the home of the brave, completed. Nazism is the grave cf freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Let those who have shrugged their shoulders about Germany as a far country now consider with concern this report of unbiased commentators on Germany a la Catholic-Naz; mode. Let those who desire to go along the road tc Nail Rom? at least approach with their eyes open, mindful that it is to abandon all hope, ye who enter here. The thoughtful will do well to pause and coniider the account herewith. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">N</span><span class="font11">OTHING in human history is more as-toimding than the present terrorization of all the nations of the eanh by Germany, Jehovah God foreknew the present and very real fear of all the nations, “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” —Luke 21:26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was nine long years ago, when Adolf Hitler was unknown to the world in general, that Judge Kutherford, in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font11"> Book One, page 273, expounding the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, wrote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In 1914 Satan’s offspring, to wit, ‘the beast that came up out of the sea,’ got into a fight, its heads </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, </span><span class="font11">1939 fighting each other, Germany the head on one aide and Britain the head on the other side led the fight. Lvery nation involved in. that war was and is a part of Satan’s organization. That World War resulted in a terrible punishment to Germany and her allies, and it looked for some time as though Germany was completely done for. This harmonizes with John’s statement: “And I saw one of his [Satan’s beastly government’s &quot;j heads, as it were ivounded to death.” The John or servant class of the Lord for some time thought that it was literally true that Germany would be destroyed. To many it seemed impossible'for Germany ever to<sup>1 </sup>recover. Then Jolin says in the same connection: “And his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.”—Revelation 13 : 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What an astounding recovery of that wounded head has taken place since that time! First went the Saar, then the Rhineland, then Austria, then the Sudetenland, then all of Czechoslovakia, then Memel, and as this is written the fate of Danzig is in the balance, Again, as in 1914, German militarists are boasting of their purpose to subjugate the entire world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">World mastery could not be gained except by the employment of a military people that will do just as they are told, regardless of results to anybody, even themselves. There must be millions of them; they must have a genius for organization ; they must worship power, the state. The German people is such , a people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“I wanteha t’ meet da boss. He’s a swell guy: Miss Europe’s crazy over ’im.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">No doubt many readers of this magazine have met Germans who share the aspirations of Hitler’s storm troopers and make no bones of their desire and expectation that Germany will some day have the entire world at her feet. In an oculist’s office in New York city in 1916 the following conversation occurred between this writer-and an apparently good-natured German sitting next in line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Germany vill vin de var.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Maybe so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Germany can lick all the nations of Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Maybe so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Germany can lick the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Maybe so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Germany can lick the whole world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Maybe so, but why would they wish to</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">,do so?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Vy? Den Germany vould be de poss.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“But why would Germany wish to be the boss ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There was no answer. The old fellow could not imagine a world of justice and peace; of truth and honor and kindness. His ideal was that somebody “vould be de poss”. The idea is from the Devil and comes to mankind through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Hitler had Jesuit train ing in h is youth. That’is where he got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This idea, if put into execution, would wreck civilization. Judge Rutherford, in the lecture “Fascism or Freedom”, puts it so that all can see the danger and see just who and what is at the bottom of it. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fanatical Fascists and Nazi dictators, with the aid and co-operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City, are now wrecking continental Europe. They may for a brief period of time gain control of the British Empire and of America, and then, God declares, He will act and through Christ Jesus, His great Executive Officer and Executioner, will completely destroy all such organizations. Then the people who obey God and Christ shall survive and live for ever in peace and happiness and will fill the earth with a righteous people, all to the praise of Jehovah. Choose ye therefore, whom ye will serve! Shall we have Faseistic Catholicism, slavery and death? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">OR</span><span class="font11"> shall we embrace Christ and His kingdom and receive true freedom and everlasting life? It is not within your power to stop the onward march of the wicked, but it is your privilege to flee to God and to His kingdom under Christ and thus find security, refuge and salvation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>An Idea Long Held</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Not only do Hitler’s storm troopers boldly sing* that first they will control ail Germans, and after that the whole world, but as far back</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">•A song, sung by the Storm Troopers everywhere in Berlin on Hitler’s 47th birthday, and generally on so-called “patriotic” days, contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Today we own Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And tomorrow the whole world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as 1855 the Viennese journalist, Ferdinand Kurnbergcr, though he was never,in America, yet said in his novel “Her Amerikamiidc”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When I look into America’s future, I see our own German greatness. For this I know in my heart: America will not perish until Germany has completed her revolutions, beyond which lie unity and freedom. Until then, 1 can wait. The spark of German spirit that I shall band on to rriy heirs will stay alive. Have not the German farmers of Pennsylvania instinctively known how to hold fast to their German ways for one hundred years? So fast that whole communities understood not a single word of English today. . . . The fall which I see facing this mongrel people concerns me no more than the fate of the goat that suckled Jupiter. Let it come—we shall not perish. Germany will send her fleet and know how to defend her German province Pennsylvania. What am I saying? Pennsy I vania </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I</span><span class="font11"> All of North America will become German, for our immigration will then rest upon a mighty motherland. But why merely North America? The whole world will become German, for Germany’s rise will mean England’s decline. When Germany awakes, no nation in the world will maintain its old rank.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Sir Edward Grey, British Foreign secretary, in March, 1915, made the following statement of the German it i cal as it was revealed to most men in the war plans of Kaiser Wilhelm. That gentleman, after having a large share of the responsibility for the killing of 10,000,000 young men, is spending a happy and peaceful old age on his estate at Doorn, Holland. Sir Edward Grey said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The German ideal—we have had it poured out by German professors pnd publicists since the war began-—is that of the Germans as a superior people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, 1939 </span><span class="font11">to whom all things arc lawful in the securing of their own power; against whom resistance of every sort is unlawful and to be savagely’ put down; a. people establishing a domination over the nations of the continent, imposing a peace that is not to be a liberty for other nations but subservience to Germany. I would rather perish than live in it under such conditions. After this war we and the other nations of Europe must be free to live, not menaced by talk of supreme war - lords and sinning armor and the sword continually rattled in the scabbard and Heaven continually invoked as an accomplice to German arms, and not having our policy dictated and our national destinies and activities controlled by the military caste of Prussia.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Lord of the World</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Nobody but an ass would want for himself that, which the Creator has awarded to 1hc .Redeemer and Vindicator, but what do you suppose was in Hitler’s mind when he said, on the last page of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf: </span><span class="font11">A State which works in the e.ra of race corruption for the cultivation .of its best racial elements is bound to become one day the lord of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On page 438 he mentions peace in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">earth gained by the victorious sword of a master people who seize the world in the service of a higher culture; and on page 315 he mentions the unnamed ‘'man of highest value” (der hochslstehende Mensch) who will have “so completely com)tiered and subjected the world that he is sole lord of the earth”. Question: In Hitler’s mind, who arc the master people and who is the man of highest value ? Another question: In the mind of the great Creator, Jehovah God, who arc they, and will Hitler win or lose in the great battle of Arma-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">geddon, which will settle the matter for ever!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hitler’s program, and in his own handwriting, too, according to the noted European correspondent Ludislas Farago, is Hungary and Poland in 1939, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Bulgaria in 1940, and Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and the Ukraine in 1941. The timetable was among the personal papers of Konrad Henlein seized by the Czech government when he escaped to Germany.

<p><span class="font11">This information does not rest merely upon the memorandum given to'Henlein by Hitler, but is in map form and hundreds of these maps were seized on the night of September 16, 1938, and were in the possession of the London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font11"> the day before Chamberlain left for Munich. He suppressed their publication; it might have interfered with the betrayal of Czechoslovakia, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>It Requires Infinite Conceit</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Tt requires infinite conceit for any mortal man to wish to dominate the earth. Hitler has that conceit in all its turpitude. In </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf,</span><span class="font11"> chapter 2, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The pacifist-humane idea may be perfectly fine when the highest man has conquered the world, and is its absolute ruler; for an idea can do no harm when its practical application is impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As showing how this bee of his own personal greatness is buzzing around in his bonnet, take this further expression on the subject from the same work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When great problems arise in the course of history, masses of people come to long for salvation, and so individuals begin to rise up to lead the way, or to attempt to. But </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">one man</span><span class="font11"> is chosen by destiny for the task, although usually it takes a long time for it to be understood by the others that this is really the leader, when he first appears. Yet an inevitable law of nature, no matter if only after centuries of struggle, finally allows the correct tnan to arrive in the position awaiting him. This always has been and forever will be. Therefore, it is not to be regretted when several or many people battle to lead the way to the same goal—the best will be recognized, and inevitably he will win. Nothing that is great in this world is the result of coalitions— victories are always won by individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In one of his recent addresses Adolf Hitler, after boasting of his great achievements, made the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I have succeeded in easting oil for ever the terrible shackles which were destined to enslave our people for all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He said that while 6,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses suffer intolerable and indescribable hardships in his concentration camps. He does not know that his triumphs are but for a day, and that when his for-ever-Iifeless carcass stinks to high heaven, and his memory is abhorred by all men, the objects of his present wrath and murderous ill-treatment will rejoice forever in the presence of the great God who will have put him to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Martha Dodd, daughter of the ex-United States ambassador in Berlin, sees a great change having taken place in Hitler in the six years in which he has had power. She says he does not look any older than the day when von Hindenburg weakly placed everything in his hands, but—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In place of the rather slender body, pale, soft, neurotic face, modest bearing, self-conscious social self-effacement, is a figure whose bcariilg is insolent and arrogant, with shoulders flung back pompously, who walks and marches as though lie bad made the earth under his feet and the people around him whom he honors with the fantastic, taut, outstretched arm. If I were to sum up Hitler’s character in a few words, J would say that he is one of the most fanatical and nearly-insane men ruling in any country of the modern world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Press Not Without Blame</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The press is not without blame in the manner in which it plays up this worthless wretch. When he was made an honorary citizen of Danzig the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> felt called upon to sacrifice six columns of the valuable.space at the top of the page, to tell about it and to supply its readers with a radiophoto. It would say it has to tell the news; but is it so necessary to carry the sayings and doings of the insane to earth’s remotest bounds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A careful reading of Hitler’s long-winded speeches shows that he uses over and over such expressions as “over a thousand years belonged to the German Reieh”; “an order which had been built up over nearly 2,000 years”; '‘states with history going back a thousand years”; “in the history of our people, now approximately 2,000 years, there are occasions and actions enough to fill us with sincere pride”; “justice to a thousand years of history”; showing that he wants to familiarize the German people, and other peoples too, with the idea of the re-establishment of the “Holy Roman Empire”, with himself at its head. It is freely predicted by some that his crowning as such emperor will take place within the current year. The German press frequently now bestows upon him a title be-' </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">stowed </span><span class="font11">on medieval German emperors who particularly distinguished themselves in enlarging the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is interesting to know that in ancient Rome the citizens greeted one another with handshakes, but slaves were compelled to extend the hand in the manner now required in Germany and in Franco’s Spain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">William Patrick Hitler, 28 years of age, now residing in the United States with his mother (the onetime sister-in-law of Adolf Hitler), says that his uncle is a menace to the whole world and that many of the Fuhrer’s friends think he is mentally unbalanced. Evidence has been repeatedly published in these columns indicating that he is in constant touch with the demons, either direct or through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, controlled by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is well known that'Hitler has only one speech; it is a denunciation of the peace treaties and filled with hatred of the Jews. When President Roosevelt sent him a telegram urging world peace he spent ten days working over the old speech and, when he came to deliver it, occupied two hours and seventeen minutes of the almost undivided attention of the world without giving expression to a single new idea. He has unlimited egotism and therefore thinks himself a marvelous orator, whereas he is, in fact, earth’s biggest demagogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Like all demagogues, Hitler is clever, in 8 way, but only superficially. He is alleged to have said of poverty: ‘‘Whoever has not himself been in the tentacles of this throttling viper will never know its fangs.”. And then the biologists laugh at him by explaining that a viper has no tentacles, a snake which ean coil around a man has no fangs, and if a man is throttled by a snake he does not make acquaintance with its fangs.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Totally Devoid of Justice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Of the great Creator it is said that justice is the habitation of His throne (Psalm 89:14), and of His Vindicator it says that He will “reprove with equity for the meek of the earth” (Isaiah 11:4); but what can be said for a man that boasts of his injustice and is teaching it to every young couple and therefore to every home in Germany? In Chapter 6 of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font11"> Hitler said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The moiient one’s own propaganda grants even JUNE 14, 193g &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a glimmer of justice to the other aide, Beads are sown for the doubting of one’s own cause. The masses are incapable of deciding where the enemy’s sins end and their own begin, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Chapter 3 of the same dastardly work he describes why his addresses are so filled with hate and fury:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If they had only realized the stupidity of the masses, and understood that for purely psychological reasons one must present not two enemies to the masses, but only one! </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A single enemy</span><span class="font11"> must be pushed forward and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all hate must be concentrated</span><span class="font11"> upon this sole opponent. It is part of the genius or a true leader to make even </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">widely different</span><span class="font11"> enemies appear to belong to but a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">single </span><span class="font11">category, . . . Moreover, the thought that there are various enemies will frighten people and cause them to doubt their own right. Then they come to fear that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">perhaps they themselves are wrong </span><span class="font11">and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">others are right.</span><span class="font11"> Then they are paralyzed. But if the masses believe that they battle but a single enemy, then belief in their own cause is strengthened and hate of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">one enemy</span><span class="font11"> is ever more bitter, is in fact </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">boundless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Listen again, in Chapter 17, to the words of this Jesuit-t rained son of the Devil, exalting his new (?) view of rule by force and cruelty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A new view of life is intolerant, and cannot he content with being merely ‘&quot;‘one party among others”. It must proudly demand absolute recognition of its supremacy, and must never rest until the world is completely readjusted. Thus while it is struggling for power it must violently attack everyone with any opposite view, and once it achieves authority it must not tolerate even the existence of anyone still representing the old condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These outbursts of insanity have their fruitage. Thus at Augsburg, Germany, every newborn boy whose father is a storm trooper receives a dagger as a gift, with the expectation that he will wear it in his belt when he comes to young manhood, and, as a matter of course, stab his fellow man in the back with it, should the occasion arise. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In tile same general line of thought, the Berlin </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Lokal - Anzeiger</span><span class="font11"> sympathized with a man that attacked Mayor La Guardia, rather than with the mayor himself. Yet the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Anzeiger </span><span class="font11">would have all the Jews in Germany slain if one more Jew kills another German embassy official. How shortsighted! Cannot anybody see that to encourage murder anywhere is to encourage it everywhere? When the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">An-zeigsr</span><span class="font11"> wants some person to kill Mayor La Guardia it also wants some other person to kill Maniac Hitler; at least, that is the logic of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is inevitable that a person who boasts of his injustice would become hated by persons who love justice. Westbrook Pegler, in the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram,</span><span class="font11"> tells what he thinks of this man, and it is not flattering. He said:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is there any sane answer to a man who holds anti-American meetings under the protection of American laws, hut in his own country decrees , that any act against “the sound feeling of the nation” shall be punished even if there is no law against the act? AU the biographies of Hitler, except the official issues —which, of course, don’t count—agree that he is a queerie of some sort. He shrieks and weeps, which is unmanly conduct according to our ideas at least; he lives on rhubarb and whey, he is a sulker and thumbsucker, and when the moon is high he may kill his best friend or give orders that an old pal of his bosom be taken for a ride in a plane and made to walk the plank without so much as an umbrella.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How can you make talk with a nut who brags that he has the toughest army and air force in the world and calls you a war-mongering world-terrorist because you decide to buy yourself a Boy Scout suit and a kite? What answer can you give a maniac who slaughters and persecutes people of all religions and himself worships bonfires in the mood of a tenement firebug, but sends agents here to establish religious freedom in America? Or can you talk sense, to an international conspirator, already convicted in court of spying on this nation, who sends agents here to become naturalized and do treason among us, but roars warnings that native American Jews are disloyal?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Professor Jung, the eminent Zurich psychologist, lecturing in London, made the following statement of the subject of this sketch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mussolini, however reckless and ruthless he may be, still is a human being with whom one can reasonably argue. Hitler, on the other side, is a phenomenon of nature. He is a mask of the collective unconscious of the German people. He might be compared with Mohammed. For Hitler no human obligations, no ethical laws, and therefore no such things as promises which are to be kept, can exist. Hitler feels himself far above human methods and institutions.</span></p>

Kampf.</span><span class="font11"> Following are citations from various chapters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Propaganda appeals forever only to the masses I The business of propaganda is not scientific training of the individual, but instead is the directing of the attention of the masses to certain, facts, events, needs, etc.—the purpose is to make things seem important. The whole art consists </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">in attacking a point so skillfully</span><span class="font11"> that a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">universal belief in its reality</span><span class="font11"> is induced, and a righteous faith constructed. Propaganda must be popularly toned, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">dropped to the intellectual level of the dullest</span><span class="font11"> of those at whom it is directed. Thus the greater the mass which must be influenced, the lower must be the form of the propaganda used. The less scientific ballast used, the more brilliant will be the success of the propaganda. The absorbent-capacity of the masses is most limited. Their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">understanding is small</span><span class="font11"> while their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">forgetfulness is great.</span><span class="font11"> Therefore, propaganda must be strictly limited to a very few essential points, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">these must be used again and again</span><span class="font11"> until the dullest man of all cannot help knowing what is meant. As soon as this principle is abandoned the force <sup>J</sup> of propaganda fades.— </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf,</span><span class="font11"> Chapter 6. [Jesuitry Ij</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every movement must use propaganda to attract followers, and organization to get numbers. There will always be about ten followers of a movement, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, 1939 </span><span class="font11">to every two actual members of the organization —-for the follower must merely agree with a movement, while the member must actively serve it. The ten followers represent, in a way, the great majority of mankind, which is lazy and cowardly; the two members correspond to the active minority which always leads the world. Thus propaganda must always be out to win followers, but the organization must scrupulously restrict membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Propaganda strives to force an idea upon people, but the organization itself must include only those whose intellectual talents do not make them a barrier standing in the way of actual realization of ends. Propaganda prepares the way for the victory of an idea in a community of men—the organization achieves this victory. The followers of an idea cannot be too great in number, but the members of the fighting organization can much more easily be too many than too few. The supreme danger which an organization faces is that early successes may create too large an early membership, for in this way weaklings get inside where later they can destroy the power of the entire movement. This explains why so often new movements apparently destined for brilliant success suddenly wither and die away. As the Bourgeois world usually says, and in this particular case it would be correct: “The wine has been spoilt with water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first task of propaganda is to win followers of the movement who are eventually to become members of the organization; the second task is to prepare the collapse of existing conditions. The first task of the organization is ■ to unite people for the continuance and the spread of propaganda; the second task of the organization is the battle for power which insures the final victory of the idea. All great movements, religious and political, owe their successes only to ,the understanding and the use of these principles, and lasting victories are impossible without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As the leader of party propaganda, I from the very first endeavored to scare away weaklings with my radical and inflammatory propaganda. I did not want them. If, at first, they nevertheless became followers of the movement they were the type who would nervously conceal the fact — in those days. Thousarids assured me then that they completely agreed with us—but that they could under no circumstances join the movement! And that was fine. The live, reckless form which I gave to our propaganda strengthened our movement, since only the vigorous people—with a few exceptions—were willing to join. Yet this propaganda in a short time won the hearts of hundreds of thousands of people who desired our victory even though they were too cowardly to stand up for the cause.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf,</span><span class="font11"> Chapter 23.

<p><span class="font11">The masses can only be captured by a ruthless and fanatic one-sided presentation of our nationalistic idea. Most people are neither professors nor diplomata; their views are based upon sentiment, and not upon reason. These people are not susceptible to half-measures—they fall victim to force. Their attitudes are generally stable, just because they are little influenced by reasoning—-for faith is stronger than knowledge, love less changeable than respect, hate more everlasting than mere dislike. The dynamic force which has made the most important changes in history has always been— not scientific intellect-—but rather a fanatic feeling of hysteria which has burled the masses in one direction or the other. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To win the soul of the people, it is not enough merely to fight for one’s own end—one must at the same time destroy the upholders of the opposite cause. A savage attack upon some adversary is proof to the people of the justice of their own cause. The masses feel that if their leaders refrain from destroying an opponent, this must be a sign of uncertainty of their own cause—if not a sign that the cause is unjust. The masses are only a fragment of nature, and their feelings cannot understand a handclasp between men who proclaim opposite views. What they want is the victory of the stronger and the annihilation of the weaker, or else his unconditional enslavement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">No man in his right mind would label himr self an unprincipled liar as many times as Hitler does in the foregoing quotations. He is down as low as the men who pretend to believe the “eternal torture” and “purgatory” stories merely because it furnishes them with a name and a bread-ticket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Manchester </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font11"> always well informed on European matters, says of this man:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Today, as in the days of Napoleon, European history is being made by one man. He sets the pace, he holds the world in suspense, and the question that transcends all other questions, day after day, is, “What will he do?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He is the greatest living demagogue. He is .a master of political strategy. He is extremely shrewd and a man of abrupt action. He regards him self</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as an instrument of Providence sent with a divine</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is Hitler’s ambition? What, in other words, drives him on and makes him drive Europe on? He believes in a kind of heaven on earth of which the National Socialist revolution is the beginning. It was originally begun on August 3, 1914, when the Great War began, in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font11"> he relates how he was overwhelmed with inexpressible joy because war had broken out. All his purpose and policy are dominated by the one thought that in such another war he must control the sequence of events so that there will be victory instead of defeat and the National Socialist revolution will have triumphed; for Hitler it will only have triumphed when the enemies that, as he declares, “encircle” it are prostrate. The Third Realm will then, and only then, have been established on permanent foundations. It will be, not merely the third, but the eternal realm, or heaven on earth as Hitler conceives it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “Providence” that Hitler feels urging him on is the Devil, the “god of this world”, also urging on the Jesuits and others of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who have made lies and cruelty their refuge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">It did not take Hitler long to rise from impecuniosity to wealth. Most of the rise was due to the circulation of the unspeakable </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf,</span><span class="font11"> practically forced into every home in Germany at $3.40 per copy, with 68c of it going as royalty to its author. Hitler is now a millionaire, with huge bank deposits in nine foreign countries, but none in Italy. The Landon </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express</span><span class="font11"> contains a description of Hitler’s new hideout on Kehl-stein Summit, 5,500 feet above sea level. It is reached only by a tunnel 390 feet long and an elevator 400 feet high. Perched like a bird on the top of an inaccessible mountain, it is large enough to comfortably house 18 people. The entrance to the tunnel is through bronze doors in the side of the mountain, guarded day and night, inside, by armed guards ready to open on the instant the Fuehrer arrives, and to deny admittance to all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hitler’s new study, 88 feet long by 45 feet wide and with ceilings 32 feet high, is the largest study 'maintained by any ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hitler, when in Berlin, takes tea almost invariably in the public room of the Kaiserhof Hotel, and anyone may sit at the next table, if it is unoccupied. But in the same dining room are always at least five members of his personal body guard, armed to the teeth, quick </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font11">.the' draw and ready for immediate action. But there is no danger; the German people are like sheep, ready to be driven anywhere by any demagogue that demands obedience and backs it up by a show of force.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>His Too Smart Companion</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The too smart young man seems to be Dr. Goebbels, whose business it was to see that the German people should lose their reason and their principle. In that he succeeded all too well, but he seems to have been too fond of actresses. Though he has a good-looking and very intelligent wife of his own, Goebbels concluded he would also like Lida, Baarova; so he sent her actor husband, Gustav' Froelich, to a concentration camp to get him out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Everything was going fine when friends of Froelich visited the Propaganda minister at Froelich’s flat, blacked both of Goebbel’s eyes, knocked out a front tooth, and cut and bruised his head so that it was necessary to take him to a hospital. Meantime Frau Goebbels, who is really the first lady of the land in Germany, wanted to get a divorce, but Hitler would not let her leave Germany. Baarova was punished by all her pictures’ being withdrawn from the German screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To lessen the scandal Goebbels gave a tame broadcast from his hospital ten days after his tooth was knocked out. All the men involved in beating him up are in prison, and will no doubt be murdered, according to present German custom. The official explanation of Goebbels’ predicament is that he was confined to his bed with intestinal grippe. /</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But intestinal grippe does not usually blacken both a man’s eyes and knock out his teeth and otherwise batter him up. Nor does it send his wife scurrying to the border to try to get out so that she can sue for divorce. Hitler and Goebbels both deserve this disgrace. Their only solution to every problem is force and propaganda. Truth and honor i and justice to .any is entirely outside their purview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Goebbels got in wrong again because he • could not have prosperity without boasting of it. He bought an island on a lake near Berlin, fitted it up with fine architecture, hothouses, riding horses, etc., and then was fool enough to put it on the screen in a movie house in Berlin, thinking he was so popular, as Hitler’s minister of propaganda, that the crowd would cheer. Somebody had the nerve </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, 193» </span><span class="font11">to hiss instead, and in a moment the whole house </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font11">in an uproar, everybody hissing.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Himmler—the Oxford Grouper</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">According to an article by A. J. Cummings in the London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font11"> for January 5, Herr Himmler, chief of the German Police, and thought by many to be the likely successor to Hitler, is a member of the religious “Oxford Group”. The article in question states;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One day last Week I was informed by one of her fellow-citizens that Frau Himmler, wife of the notorious German Chief of Police, is a zealous member of the Oxford Group. When I mentioned this afterwards rather skeptically to a prominent English Conservative he replied: “Of course, there is nothing new in that piece of information. You are evidently unaware that Himmler himself ie an eminent Oxford Grouper,” Himmler, as an exponent of “moral rearmament”—a rally ing-ery of the Oxford Group—will surely evoke a shout of demoniac laughter in the nether world. One supposes that Hitler, whose private intelligence service is of the best, knows perfectly well that Himmler is grooming himself as the unrivaled successor to his present lord and master.- The party friends of this man of unbounded ambitions assert proudly that as the new Fuehrer he will out-Hitler Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Himmler is said to be Germany’s most dreaded man, and as chief of the German Police as well as the S. S. Storm Troopers, this is probably true, for he controls with ruthless determination an army of tremen* dous and terrifying efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">His promotion in the Nazi organization has been astoundingly rapid, even for a Nazi leader. As early as 1927, when he was but twentyseven years old, he commanded the entire S. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">3. </span><span class="font11">Guard in Germany. He had joined this organization two years previously! Later he was entrusted with the organisation of the secret police and, in April, 1934, was given control of all the political police in Germany. Two years later he was appointed chief of the entire German police force. He is also a member of the inner Nazi cabinet of 19 members, which is ultimately responsible. In the name of two of the forces which he controls, the Gestapo, or Secret State Police, and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">S.S. </span><span class="font11">Storm Troopers, the most unspeakable tyranny is exercised daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is reported that when he found the Boman Catholic faith conflicting with Nazi principles, he publicly renounced it. If the article from the Aetas </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font11"> above quoted is true, no doubt the Oxford Group is proud of its member.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Massachusetts—There She Cringes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">Hon. Leverett SaltonstaU, Governor of Massachusetts, Boston, Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two newspaper clippings come to my desk this morning which so strikingly display a glaring inconsistency in actions of your General Court that I feel impelled to write to you concerning them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first is from the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font11"> of yesterday tolling of the recognition and ratification of the Bill of Rights by the General Court. You arc quoted as making the following statement in a letter to Secretary of State Hull: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I hope it will serve to make the present and future generations conscious of the deep significance of the Bill of Rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You are further quoted as asking the General Court to ratify the Bill of Rights to “remind the nation of the need for vigilance in guarding liberties”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those are grand words, worthy of the careful consideration of all people. But words without consistent action arc of little value. The language of the apostle, ‘But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, thereby deceiving yourselves,’ would seem applicable to statesmen as well as others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Clipping Number Two is from the Springfield (Mass.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Union</span><span class="font11"> and informs all people that the Genera] Court of Massachusetts is ready to reject an amendment to the compulsory flag-salute law exempting children who conscientiously and sincerely believe that such ceremonial is a violation of the law of God. This means that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts insincerely acknowledges the Bill of Rights in words only, not in deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How can future generations be expected to become more “conscious of the deep significance of the Bill of Rights” when in the same breath with its adoption the General Court spurns and denies the right of a little school child to determine for himself whether his act is one of obedience to the command of Almighty God? What business docs the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have to “remind the nation of the need for vigilance in guarding liberties”, when its high legislative body sustains and upholds a law which subjects parents to criminal prosecution for teaching children to obey God in accordance with the dictates of conscience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I am enclosing copy of a memorandum* submitted to the Genera] Court by Jehovah’s witnesses. On page two this statement is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To claim that this law does not infringe upon religious liberty is cither hypocritical misrepresentation or a clear case of mental incompetence to recognize indisputable facts,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I don’t believe the members of your General Court are mentally incompetent to recognize facts. The other alternative must then be true. They sanctimoniously join with you in lip service to the Bill of Rights, but in the same moment they cruelly deny those rights to Godfearing children of the Commonwealth, “Massachusetts-—There she stands.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May I respectfully state that you should not shirk responsibility in the matter. On your election to office thousands of citizens of your Commonwealth rejoiced in the belief that you would faithfully uphold the rights of all people. You now have an excellent opportunity to publicly demonstrate your worthiness of that confidence. The unjust and cruel eon' dition of affairs upheld and confirmed by your General Court merits your immediate attention. Any state executive, having a just regard for the value of his words, should protest vigorously and emphatically over the smoothtongued mouthing of nice words, about the Bill of Rights and scornful rejection of its fundamental principles at one and the same time. This political hypocrisy does not touch you yet, but you will be contaminated if you do not protest promptly and vigorously to the General Court. You should demonstrate definitely and clearly that you mean what you say about guarding liberties in a special message to the legislature calling attention to the fact that the liberties of the little school children are just as important as'others, and recommending reconsideration and reversal of the action of the General Court. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The door is open to you to have a worth- ’ while part in preserving liberty in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. Yours very truly, Own R. Motive, General Counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">[• Memorandum follows herewith.—Ed.] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the General Court of Massachusetts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You have before you for consideration two measures calling for amendment of Section 69 of Chapter 71 General Laws. These bills would exempt from participation in the school flag-salute ceremonies all those who object to such salute on conscientious grounds. One bill is Senate No. 207. The other, House No. 1045. They are similar in form, and the adoption of either one will remedy a very deplorable situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Section 69 of Chapter 71 General Laws provides for the daily salute to the flag in the public schools of Massachusetts. I.t has no provision for exemption of those who conscientiously hold and believe that the saluting of a flag is a violation of the jaw of Almighty God. Jehovah’s witnesses maintain and believe that as Christians consecrated to J eh ova h G od they must obey Mis laws and refrain from any act of obeisance to a flag or any other kind of image. As a result of their adherence to this principle an intolerant and unjust condition of affairs has been engendered throughout the state..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THE SITUATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Legislature should face squarely the evil and unjust conditions now existing as a result of the indiscriminate enforcement of this law. On the one side you have a law and school officials obligated to enforce it. On the other side is the Godfearing child desiring to live in accordance with righteous principles and obey the law of Almighty God. Such child is taught and believes that such law of God forbids the salute to- any flag. The law, as it now stands, says he must salute or be kicked out of school. It thus denies the child the right of private judgment and unmercifully interferes with freedom of conscience. Arguing about the benefits of patriotic instruction cannot change a situation. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Facts</span><span class="font11"> cannot be talked away. The Genera! Court must face and should fearlessly consider these incontrovertible facts:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. The law as it now stands denies the school child the right to determine for himself whether his act is one of obedience or disobedience to the commands of Almighty God.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390614_files/g_E_19390614-11.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:244pt;">
<p><span class="font11">Massachusetts’ idea of Bill of Rights</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. The law as it now stands removes from the parent and child the right of private judgment and determines for them the validity of their beliefs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. The law as it now stands subjects a parent to criminal prosecution for teaching his child to obey God in accordance with the dictates of conscience.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and other high courts have solemnly held that the compulsory flag-salute in no wise infringes on freedom of worship. Courts may render opinions, but' they cannot change facts. They may hand down decisions, but they cannot set aside fundamental principles of righteousness. Some courts have evaded the incontrovertible facts above stated, and have denied the eternal principle that no man, be he judge or school official, has the right to determine for another tha validity of his conscientious beliefs. In the case of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font11"> v. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Minersville School District</span><span class="font11"> (21 Fed. Supp. 584), Judge Maris held:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To permit public officers to determine whether the views</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">of individuals sincerely held and their acts sincerely undertaken on religious grounds are in fact based on convictions religious in character would be to sound the death knell of religious liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In all the various cases involving this question, no court or attorney has answered, or attempted to answer, this fundamental declaration of the right of private judgment. They have ignored it and solemnly set forth decrees contrary thereto. These decrees if followed and maintained will indeed sound the death knell of religious liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For nearly four years this Commonwealth has sought to solve the problem through the rule of force. The law has been declared supreme over the rights of conscience. The right of private judgment has been shelved apd attempts made to force Christian children to smother their convictions, stifle conscience, and blindly perform an act which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, 1939</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">they sincerely believe to be morally wrong. Illustrative of this medieval war against eoifeBience is the ease of William A. Johnson, and his three children, William, Jr., Dorothy and Gloria, of South Deerfield, Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The parents requested exemption of the children from the flag-salute exercise for reasons as here set forth. The request was denied. The children declined to salute. They were then expelled from the South Deerfield public schools. Dor a month they endeavored to secure admittance to the school, but they were shouldered out. Johnson did his best to secure equivalent education elsewhere but was unable to. Twenty-five others have been similarly treated in this Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The next step was to summon the father into court, where he was charged with unlawfully causing bis children to be absent from instruction in the schools. This charge was made in spite of the fact that he had been doing his level best to secure instruction for them, and that the school authorities had barred them from school. Three years ago „ Ignace Opielouski, oi Belchertown, was fined forty dollars by the court on a similar charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The next step in this inquisition, in accordance with the threats of school officers and prosecutor, will be to tear the Johnson children from their home and commit them to a reformatory<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark50">1</a></sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To claim that this Jaw does not infringe upon religious liberty is either hypocritical misrepresentation or a clear case of mental incompetence to recognize indisputable facts. Any honest-minded person must admit that the compulsory flag-salute as now applied is wrong in principle and outrageous in its operation. It is a glaring denial to lawabiding citizens of that “liberty and justice roll all” guaranteed by the language of the flag-salute pledge, and even more emphatically vouchsafed to everyone in the United States of America by the Constitution of the Republic 'for which the flag stands’. The following comment of Judge Lehman, of the New York Court of Appeals, is very appropriate to the situation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The salute of the flag is a gesture of love ' and respect—fine when there is real love and respect back of the gesture. The flag is dishonored by a salute by a child in reluctant and terrified obedience to a command of secular au-thoritv which clashes with the dictates of conscience, The flag ‘cherished by all our hearts’ should not be soiled by the tears of a little child. The Constitution does not permit, and the Legislature never intended, that the flag should be so soiled and dishonored.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This mode of solving the problem created by this statute has settled nothing and will settle nothing. If has brought about a deplorable and uiijust condition of affaire which demands the unbiased consideration of the General Court. The amendments here in question will go, a long way toward remedying the evils complained of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DO NOT BE SWAYED BY RELIGIOUS PREJUDICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A deliberate attempt was made by one of the members of the Committee on Education at the hearing on these amendments to inject a religious prejudice into the issue. Henry Judson, one of Jehovah’s witnesses and a speaker in favor of the amendment, was asked by a committee member if he was in accord with a letter sent by counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses to the president of the United States, wherein it was alleged that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is Enemy Number One of honest, God-fearing American people. This letter had no bearing whatsoever on the matter before the committee, and the question was obviously put to create prejudice against the proponents of the measure. Jehovah’s witnesses unqualifiedly endorse the statement of the letter, and in a hearing before a competent tribunal where that issue is involved they will gladly bring evidence to prove the allegation. In addition, they can likewise present in this matter much evidence of intolerant and wicked acts of persecution by deluded subjects of that foreign Roman power, in connection with this flag-salute inquisition. We believe, however, that the issue should be decided on its merits without reference to the particular acts of those who believe totali-t a ri an rule should prevail .over the rights pf conscience. We protest against this malicious attempt to becloud the issue through religious prejudice. The General Court should consider the matter and pass upon it solely upon its merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The General Court has two alternatives! It can take the easy course, deny passage of either aiiiehd-ment, and let the present unjust condition of affairs continue. By so doing it will continue to deny children of God-fearing parents the right of education in the public schools; it will continue to deny them the right of self-decision relative to obedience to Almighty God; it will continue to besmirch and degrade the emblem of the Republic which it insists the children must revere, and will continue to uphold and strengthen the hands of those who would “sound the death knell of raligioua liberty” in this country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, why not boldly take the initiative in restoring “freedom to worship Almighty God” in Massachusetts to the original high plane intended by the Commonwealth’s BiH of Rights!</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51"><span class="font11">We respectfully submit that one of the proposed amendments should be adopted.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font11">As one born and having spent over fifty years on a fam, I have this, to say about farming: If farmers were restricted in their holdings to, say 200 acres, in every country, and if any acquiring additional farms were compelled to work these themselves or to put tenants on the farms, there would be less poverty among the farmer class. Also if shares were on the scale Joseph set in Egypt—one part for Pharaoh and four parts for themselves (Genesis 47:24)—this would solve the problem; for it shows that if slavery was rife in Egypt, justice was meted out in a very different style from the present in what is called a “free”. country right here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A noticeable thing was mentioned in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">G.A. [Consolation]</span><span class="font11"> a .few months back, and a favorable comment was made upon it: The point had been suggested that about six inches of limestone be applied to the land in “the dust bowl”, to prevent harmful removal of the spil. If a little calculation had been made it would surely have been seen that this would be futile; not that it would not hold the soil in place, but how could it be plowed or worked with any implement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then again: We are told that an inch of rain makes a weight of about 113 tons of water to the acre; and since limestone is upward of two and one-half times the weight of water, it would require 282| tons of limestone to the acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A township is about thirty-six square miles; a square mile is 640 acres. At this rate it would take 6,508,800 tons for one alone of the many townships in the several affected states. Does this look feasible? This shows how brainless the brain trust is, to conjure up such nonsensical things. They are simply laboring in their drunken madness.-j-Joseph Levens, Indiana.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ The General Sherman sequoia tree in California is believed to be the oldest and largest living thing oh earth. Thirty-six feet at its greatest diameter, and 272 feet high, it is estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 years old, and may have been several hundred years old when Moses came marching out of Egypt 3,453 years ago this spring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ There are two sides to the question of crop control. Nobody would argue that the big automobile makers should go on making automobiles which cannot be sold. So then, what about raising more wheat than can be sold? There is a difference, in this, that people do not have to have automobiles, but they do have to eat; and so it could be said that any surplus of wheat might be sent to feed the starving or half-starving millions of China and India. But who will pay for it? And if it is not paid for, how will the farmers that want automobiles pay for their chariots? Those who wonder how problems of this nature can ever be solved should read </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font11"> Book Two, page 61, wherein is revealed God’s purpose to destroy present oppressive commercialism.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Soil Erosion in the U. S. A. .</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">♦ In the United States alone soil erosion </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font11">ruined 110,000,000 acres of fertile land, while more than 1,000,000,000 acres have lost between two-thirds and three-quarters of their covering of soil. In some parts of the world, where the soil covers rock by only 12 </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">to 24 </span><span class="font11">inches, erosion is depleting the surface at the rate of an inch a year. The earth is nearing the point where it must have an all-wise and all-powerful ruler to enable the people to know what toodo. And this Jehovah God has provided in Christ Jesus, earth’s new </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">King.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Reforestation Well Under Way</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Reforestation in the United States is well under way, and should be. Last year the United States forest service planted 189,530<sub>;</sub>-000 trees. The largest planting was in Michigan, where 42,031 acres were reforested, and after that Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Minnesota had each more than 10,000 acres. Eleven other states had more than 2,000 acres each. The plantings run about 1,000 trees to the acre.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>The Making of Dwarf Plants ,</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">♦ James F. Craven, Glendale, California, has found a method of making dwarf plants. Rose bushes grow to be two inches high, with flowers in proportion. Spruce trees grow to </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font11">foot in height. Orange trees and fruit </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">are tiny, </span><span class="font11">but the oranges are of fine flavor. All this is done by treating the seeds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Gulf Stream Became Chilly</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ For some unknown reason the Gulf Stream suddenly became chilly off Miami in early August, 1938, with resultant snowstorms in Britain. This, it is to be hoped and believed, was only temporary, probably caused by some undersea disturbance. If permanent, the damage that would be done to Europe would be immeasurable. No doubt the demons that control Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Franco would like also to have possession of the forces of nature, but it may be doubted that this would be allowed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ Jupiter’s family is not really growing larger. It only seems that way. Galileo found four of the moons with his telescope two feet long, made out of a wooden tube-, in 1610. Subsequently five more were discovered. Now Numbers 10 and 11 have been picked up by the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, and maybe there are yet more to be found when the giant 200-ineh telescopes are turned his way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>

He became so proficient that he has earned a fellowship in the Royal Meteorological Society; something of a distinction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ Mother earth is troubled in the Yellowstone region. The times of. the geysers’ spouting have changed, being now more frequent than formerly, and in some eases the heights to which the hot waters are thrown have increased. The reason is unknown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Legalized Wickedness</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font11">HEN a legislative body enacts a law the enforcement of which brings sorrow, grief and wickedness upon the people, such is 'framing mischief [wickedness] by law’. A law which compels the performance of acts of supposed patriotism is a mischievous law; for the reason, it destroys liberty of conscience and freedom of worship of Almighty God. The nation of Babylon once made a law which compelled every person, under severe penalties, to render worship or obeisance to a golden idol. Obedience to that law was a direct violation of the commandment of Almighty God; and therefore three men, who ' had agreed to be obedient to God, refused to obey the mandate of Babylon. They were cast into a furnace of fire. The law of Babylon worked mischief upon those men, and would have resulted in their destruction, but, because of their faithfulness to the Almighty God, He preserved and delivered them from the fire. God’s rules never change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some of the states of America are trying to compel the people to show that they are patriotic, and in doing so they have enacted .laws compelling school children to salute the flag of the United States and to sing patriotic songs by which protection and salvation are attributed to the State. Such is a violation of the law of Almighty God (Exodus 20:2-5), and for that reason true Christians decline to be made patriotic by law. Compulsion could never make true patriots. Christians obey God rather than man. (Acts 5: 29) Long ago God caused to be written in His Word concerning the opponents of the Almighty that “they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent”. It is Satan, the wicked one, that causes such iniquitous action to be taken by men in making and in enforcing mischievous laws, and therefore says the Lord in His Word: “Shall <sup>T </sup>the throne of iniquity [wickedness] have fellowship [anything in common] with thee, which [iniquitous ones] frameth mischief by a law?”—Psalm 94:20.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Satan the Devil by his representatives has inaugurated the totalitarian rule in European nations, and which totalitarian governments continue to frame mischief by law which oppresses the people. That same mischievous rule is rapidly taking hold upon America. Under the false pretense of making children patriotic they are now compelled by law to attribute their protection and salvation to the state or nation. The courts of America have now reversed the time-honored ruling that the law of God is above or superior to the law of man, and thus the lawmakers are left free to continue to enact ■ and enforce laws injurious to the people. Do you care to have your children taken away from you and their education committed exclusively to that element of the nation which defames the name of God and Christ? That will be the next step in America if the enactment and enforcement of so-called “patriotic laws” continue. Hitlerism began by compelling the people to “Heil Hitler”, which means that they look to Hitler for salvation. Now all the children of Germany are required to receive special Hitler education, military training, and to “Heil Hitler”, bow before his image and -perform that which is in violation of God’s law. If the parents or children insist on giving obedience to Almighty God they are taken away to prison or concentration camps and are there subjected to all manner of cruel punishment. The laws of Germany increasingly work mischief upon the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A man engaged in business in Germany recently visited the United States and has brought to me a signed and firsthand report by one of Jehovah’s witnesses which shows that conditions in Germany are far worse than that reported by any of the press. For his protection I withhold his name. The following are excerpts'taken from that written report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Under the terrorism of the Nazi rule Germany has become a nation of hypocrites and cowards. Though at least 75 percent of the people hate the Nazi regime, which fact is also shown by the hitter jokes rapidly circulating from mouth to mouth, they outwardly feign great enthusiasm. Amongst the worst hypocrites are those millions of former Communists who afe now amongst the noisiest Nazis and flag-wavers. In order to hide their former political activities as Communists or to prove the thoroughness of their “change of heart”, they go even so far as to betray and denounce other people as out of harmony with Nazism, and thus cause their imprisonment. This fact is well known amongst the German people, and serves to make the steadfastness of the Christians known as Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">vah’s witnesses the mare outstanding. Those faithfid Christians are known all over<sup>1</sup> Germany, among the people who are still appreciating honesty, as the only honest and upright people left in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The unshakable steadfastness on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses sometimes wrings respect even from opponents, as the following ^ase shows: In the concentration camp Buchenwalde bei Weimar the following test was made: One hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses were commanded to fall in line. Then they were told they would be released on the condition that they renounce their faith, acknowledge that they followed false doctrines, and pledge that they would cease from any further activities for the prohibited organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and would avoid having anything to do with any of them. They were warned that refusal to accept these conditions would mean that they would rot in the camp and would never again see their families and friends. Sixty-four of them immediately refused to accept the terms of their liberation; but the 36 others asked for time to think it over. Then the latter group was separated from the steadfast group, and in the glare of strong searchlights the faithful were compelled to go through punitive exercises from 11 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. to the point of complete exhaustion. Then the 36 were called and placed in position opposite the 64, and the commander of the guards said, in substance: ‘These 64 we have punished, but you 36 cowards your Jehovah will punish.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A similar test was made by that evil - faced Himmler, the commander in chief of the German police (including the Gestapo) himself, in the women’s concentration camp in Mohr in gen. Of the hundred assembled women who were threatened by Himmler that they would never again get a taste of sweet liberty unless they renounced their faith, all the hundred, without a single&quot; exception, answered: “Wir bleiben Jehova treu” (We remain faithful to Jehovah). Thereupon Himmler left the place in rage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a fact that many of the tormentors of Jehovah’s witnesses are by now tired of the whole business. The government, apparently. aware of this fact, therefore sees to it that from time to time a fresh sadistic element is brought into the ranks of inquisitors and guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is true that most of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">alleged</span><span class="font11"> “suicides” of Jehovah's witnesses in prison and camps are plain murders; but, on the other hand, there can be no doubt that some have actually committed suicide. The causes are momentary insanity due to blows on the head or other inhuman tortures, drugs which were secretly mixed into the food or drink of the prisoners, nervous breakdowns, and in a number of eases remorse over betrayal of brethren under torture, or remorse over a compromise made with the enemy. From the prison in Bautzen, Saxony, alone, twelve to eighteen .suicides (real or alleged eases) have been reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For a long time these imprisoned Christians in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the concentration camps were refused the privilege (granted to all other prisoners in the camps) of writing home a monthly letter of one page, and - of receiving any mail. The resulting uncertainty ■about the condition and the whereabouts of the prisoners, and by them as to their loved ones, Was an additional torment and severe trial of faith. Finally the wives and other close relatives of the prisoners began an organized action to end that nerve-wracking suspense. They sent an ever-increasing flood of letters to the wardens of the prison camps and other officials, inquiring whether prisoner So-and-so was still alive, or else, when he died and where he was buried. So many inquiries poured into the wardens’ and commanders’ offices that they printed and mailed the following reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Prisoner ------, held in preventive custody,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">still remains as before, a stubborn Bible stu. dent, and refuses to renounce the false teach</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ings of the Bible students. Therefore he has been deprived of the usual privilege of writing and receiving letters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Nazis do not persecute Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere with the same cruelty. Notorious especially is the province, of Saxony. In Kaendler, for instance, the Nazi leader has issued the order to denounce anyone who is heard to use the name Jehovah. The very same day, or, at latest, the next<sup>x </sup>day, such a one is sent, without trial, to a concentration camp for an indefinite time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">About ninety-nine percent of the people have either willingly or unwillingly made their children join the Hitler Youth organization for political and military training. A new law is now trying to get hold also of the remaining one percent of the children between 10 and 18 years. Those parents who will not yield will be sent to prison or eon-centration camp and the children become wards of the state. This new law threatens to dissolve hundreds of families of the remnant and Jonadabs. in the ever-widening territory under the heels of the monstrosity of desolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How strong, on the other hand, is the sympathy of people of good will, may be seen from the fact that some are risking freedom and life in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses. Several instances are reported where prison guards were smuggling in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font11"> Wtatclt-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font11"> for the incarcerated brethren. In other instances brethren were secretly warned by police officials of impending raids, or police officers intentionally ^overlooked “evidence of guilt” in form of literature or letters found when they had to search homes of brethren. Recently, when a brother was dismissed after a long prison sentence, the officer who escorted him to the gate repeatedly tried to tell him something but was always prevented because some person approached. Finally he asked the brother if ho did not wish to go to the washroom before leaving the building. There he informed the brother that he would soon receive through the mail some Watch Tower (prohibited) literature; that this is a trap set by the Gestapo;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and therefore he advised the brother to bring that literature immediately to the police. After release from prison brethren have to report daily at police headquarters, where they only wait to sea whether they will salute with “Heil Hitler” or not. In one instance, where a brother just said “Good evening”, when entering the office, he was treated very kindly by the police official at the desk, who told him that the refusal to use the “German salute” embarrasses him greatly, since he has the order, amongst other things, also to report whether the released ■ prisoner salutes with “Heil Hitler” or not. He said he simply had not the heart to send the brother to prison again or, what is worse, to a concentration eamp, and thus separate him from wife and children again. Therefore he would not betray the brother, and he advised him to come always at the same hour, when he himself would be on duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Often families of imprisoned brethren are refused employment and then also unemployment relief.' Then it becomes the privilege and duty of other brethren to share with them whatever means they have. Due to the present huge rearmament in Germany, all wheels of industry and trade are turning day and night, and brethren who have some business of their own, and others, are prospering financially and are thus in position to support other brethren. The lack of raw materials and also of some food products makes it very easy to sell any merchandise, and this fact has enabled numerous brethren (and thousands of them are still free) to make a livelihood for themselves and others. The man who brings this message to you has spent large sums of money for the support of Jehovah’s witnesses in distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There can be no doubt that there is now an ever-widening rift in Germany between the Nazis and organized religion, including the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Nazis and their Press are now using increasingly violent and threatening language against the religionists, especially against the Roman Catholifi religious leaders. The result is that the ehureh buildings in Germany have become deserted places. Less than one percent of the Protestant people are’still going to church; Catholic churches are less deserted, because the priests have had longer experience in how to hold people in bondage and fear. The slogan in Germany is, “Only a fool goes to church”; and in small towns, where the people know one another, the fear of ridicule has emptied the churches. For instance, in the town of Saxony, which has a population of 3,000, only 8 attend the services in the Protestant church; a few more go to the Catholic church. Since 1938 almost all parochial schools in the present territory of Germany are closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Last September, when Europe was at the verge of another world war, the people in Germany were full of fear and foreboding. Everywhere one could hear people remark that Armageddon is impending. There is obviously a hunger for truth in Germany, and many are willing to listen to the Kingdom message. Many people are dusting their Bible and beginning to study it, and many regret that they permitted themselves to be frightened into burning the Watch Tower literature, which could now help them to understand the Bible, One lady tourist now in a. New York hotel will extend her stay in America for another week just for the purpose of reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Riekes,</span><span class="font11"> or both, in German, though this will cost her the last dollar of the money the German government permitted her to take along, that is, about one hundred dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Stealthily totalitarianism is laying hold upon America. Legislative, executive and judicial parts of the government are failing in line. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, hoping to become the state church of America, is making every possible effort to fasten' the dictator rule upon the American people. Do you want the totalitarian rule or the rule of Christ the Righteous One?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What will be the-result? The compete destruction of everything that opposes God and Christ and His kingdom. It is written in the Scriptures: “And the ten horns [ governmental power] which thou sawest upon the beast {meaning the beastly ruling element], these shall hate the whore [the hypocritical, religious system, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy], and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their [the dictators’] hearts to fulfil his will.”-Revelation 17 ; 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The (beast here represents the unrighteous or cruel rule of the world. The beastly dictator element now rules Germany and regiments the people. Those rulers well know that the religious system that takes the lead in religious polities of the world is made up of hypocrites, and they hate that religious system, which is described in the Scriptures as the “harlot”; and the beastly element will destroy the same. Those rulers also hate all who serve Jehovah God in spirit and in truth, and will then attempt to annihilate all such Christians. When so doing, as the Scriptures plainly show, the Lord God through Christ Jesus will take </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> hand and completely wipe out those who persist in opposing God and who persecute His servants. Events are rapidly coming to pass disclosing that the final showdown is near, when God will destroy the wicked rule and establish righteousness in the earth for ever. Those who love God and His King, Christ Jesus, will take courage and rejoice, because the day of their deliverance is near. Such must and will remain faithful and true to Jehovah and His King.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ I cannot, of course, read all the books that are being published, nor is it necessary to do so. You, the Catholic laity of the diocese, have your own duties in this matter. If you know that a book, magazine, periodical, or paper is in circulation among our Catholic people that should not be, it is your duty to stop it. You can do so in various ways; it is not necessary for me to tell you how. It is my duty to do what I can to suppress such an evil and I am empowered to use canonical punishments to enforce my decrees.—“Most Rev.

<p><span class="font11">Admiring a religious crook, the London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font11"> put in the same paragraph the news that John J.

<p><span class="font11">In standing by the Nazis and Fascists, and by the pope, who was behind both those organizations, and especially for his share in throwing the Protestant country of Czechoslovakia to the wolves, Chamberlain earned a medal. This medal was given to him by the late pope when Chamberlain ducked in his presence at the Vatican in January. On his visit to the pope, Chamberlain was not compelled to kiss the foot or other parts of the Vatican monarch, but only to bow low when he came into his “august” presence. It was all carefully figured out in advance, even to the exact number of steps the pope would take in his advances toward Chamberlain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How the Vatican crowd do revel in big numbers and a big bluff! This is how the United Press reported the half-hour visit of one politician to another:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican Citv (U. P.)—Neville Chamberlain, spokesman for the 500,000,000 people of the British Empire, as premier of the mother country, conferred on world problems today with Pope Pius XI, spiritual father of the world’s 332,000,000 Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font11"> reports that the “Reverend Father” John L. Wright, of Our Lady and St. Edward Roman Catholic Church, Chiswick, W., London, will train 100 air cadets. He explained that there would be no difficulty in getting the 100 air cadets. They will be boys fourteen to eighteen. They will be useful in the stormy days ahead when the Hierarchy takes formal control of Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new constitution for the island of Malta provides that no priests or nobles may be elected to serve in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">On Marrow Bones Before the Papacy </span><span class="font11">♦ On their marrow bones before the Papacy, the World Jewish Congress meeting at Paris, France, passed the following resolution, which is certainly an example of ineptness, cowardice and hypocrisy if ever one was passed in the world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We record the Jewish people’s deep appreciation of the stand taken by the Vatican against the advance of resurgent paganism which challenges all traditional values of religion as well as inalienable human rights upon which alone enduring civilization can be founded. The Congress salutes the Supreme Pontiff, symbol of the spiritual forces which under many names are fighting for the re-establi^ment of the rule of moral law in human society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the first time in Italia history, every foreigner arriving in Rome just prior to Hitler’s visit to Mussolini had to answer questions put to him regarding his religion. Those who, like Hitler and Mussolini, could prove that they were practical Catholics had nothing to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A typical example of Fascism (Catholic Action) at work is seen in the act of Mussolini’s government in placing an Italian cruiser at the disposal of the Papal legate to the bread show at Tripoli, Africa, on the pretext that this act of idolatry was of great importance. The cruiser flew both the Italian and the Papal flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Italians who control the racket operating out of Vatican City take no chances. Hence, though the alleged population of Catholics in the world runs to fantastic figures, and is figured at many times the total population of Italy, yet when it came to voting in a new pope there were 35 cardinals from Italy and 27 to represent all the rest of the world. The popes who are in office see to it that enough Italians are in every batch of new cardinals to keep the balance of power in Italian hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The decline in the Italian birth rate from 30.8 per 1,000 of population, the year when Mussolini made his spectacular sleeping-car ride to Rome, to 22.2 per 1,000 sixteen years later, cannot all be charged to Mussolini. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The American Protestant</span><span class="font11"> thinks that the real trouble is because the pope has blessed so many marriages in recent years.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>“Ancient Religion Totalitarian”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">♦ The Scientific correspondent of the Manchester </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font11"> reporting addresses of various scientific speakers at a congress on the early history of the Orient, made the observation, “Ancient religion, we must remember, was totalitarian”; thus confirming absolutely Judge Rutherford’s Biblical presentation that Totalitarianism, the modern Goliath, is the religion of the Devil, the mystery of iniquity, the abomination that maketh desolate, the putting of the state above the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The papal standard was red in color for centuries prior to 1808, when Napoleon occupied Rome and forced papal troops into his service. To mislead the public he allowed the papal soldiers to wear their former colors and Pope Pius VII ordered a new flag, white and ycllowj to be prepared, and this I12SS been the papal standard since.” — Catholic </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Tribune. /</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In 1914 the “Reverend Father” Pirro Pa-seueci was one of several Italian priests given huge sums of the Vatican plunder to deposit in foreign banks. No sooner had he got the money to America, with $9,800,000 to his own credit and $200,000 to a nephew, than he up and diedj Maybe somebody bumped him off who knew that in some way he had his fingers in the money chest. Now the Vatican is claiming that the money belongs to the Hierarchy, and a fight is on to see who is to have it, the 300 Pascucei heirs or the racketeers who had the loot in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The boys at the Vatican are getting awfully careless. One of them knocked over a big candle and set fire to St. Peter’s throne, the same one Pete used to sit in, if you will believe it. And if you don’t believe it you are shy on faith. Anyway, the Swiss guards, whose job makes it necessary for them to be sober when on duty, put the fire out, so no harm was done. But such carelessness, and on Sunday, and the thirteenth of the month, too!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That was quite an amusing headline in the Roman Catholic </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font11"> published in London, when, in speaking of money and valuables stolen a short time previous from apartments at the Vatican, it said in big type, “Thieves wore Vatican uniform.” What else would they wear! They could hardly go naked, could they ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For being too gay with the ladies, in expensive theaters, restaurants and night clubs, another Vatican crook, Mario Politi, 30, administrator of the Vatican library, was locked up in the Vatican City jail charged with embezzlement. Politi is the son of the pope’s exchauffeur.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Ten Million Were Going to Pray</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">♦ The Jesuit!zed American press boasted that 10,000,000 rosaries would •be said for Pope Pius XI on Lincoln’s Birthday, February 12. The boasts were made on February 2, and in eight days the pope was a corpse. Boasting and prayers do not fit together very well. And, besides, it does not fit very well for an Italian pope to try to steal the show, and make Americans forget that there is reason to believe their honored President Lincoln was assassinated as a result of a Roman Catholic conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After a pope dies, the body is placed on a catafalque with the end jutting out through the rails of the tEM®* chapel so that those who desire may ' file past and kiss his feet. This was done, as usual, with the body of Pope Pius XI. Concerning his successor, the able newspaper correspondent Anne O’Hare McCormick says that in Rome the new pope, Eugenio Pacelli, has the reputation of being austere, even cold; and Rome ought to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Joseph P. Kennedy, at the cost of the taxpayers of the United States, left his job at the Court of St. James’s in London, to become Mr. Franklin Deficit Roosevelt’s personal representative at the crowning of Eugenio Pacelli with the “triple crown of heaven, earth and hell”, Mr. Pacelli is reported to have expressed great admiration for Roose- ' velt because of the latter’s stand for the racket, religion, which Pacelli represents. It is not the least to be wondered at. The two politicians are mutually helpful to each' other in putting it over on the pawns, the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As Papal secretary of state it was his, Cardinal Pacelli’s, alleged duty, when Pius XI was known to have expired, to take a silver hammer, strike him three times on the forehead, and call him each time by his name Achille. When there was no response after the third blow it was his duty to say in Latin, “Truly the pope is dead.” The story may not be true, because nothing that emanates from Vatican City can be believed, but still—</span></p><img src="g_E_19390614_files/g_E_19390614-17.png" alt="" style="width:166pt;height:42pt;">

<p><span class="font11">THE contact of wild life with “civilization” frequently brings about amusing incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Nova Scotia a moose happened upon the highway and, frightened by an approaching car, ran ahead of it for </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">considerable distance, while the car kept up </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">speed of 35 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another moose, not so easily frightened, attacked a car in the Ontario woods, and departed carrying the radiator screen on his antlers. Both lamps (of the automobile) were smashed, and both front mudguards were battered in by the huge spread of horns, Another opponent of progress, an elk, in Colorado, was condemned to be shot for charging automobiles, ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A moose’swimming a stream above the Island Falls hydroelectric jilant on the Churchill river, Canada, was frightened by Indians along the shore. Turning about, it was caught by the current and carried over the spillway. It was thrown into a sitting position as it went over the dam, and waved its forelegs like a man waving his arms in distress. In this dramatic way it took the plunge, disappeared in the whirlpool, and emerged none the worse for the thrilling ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the woods near Lcksand, Sweden, a peasant fiddler, playing his violin, was soon surrounded by an entire moose family, bull, cow and calves. They gave rapt attention </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font11">the fiddler began to imitate the Call of the cuckoo. They then left in disgust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A military expert, presumably Swedish, proposed on one occasion to add a moose cavalry regiment to the army. A moose squadron, he contended, would demoralize an entire horse regiment. The novel plan was not put into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The moose of Europe and Asia are called elk. They are found in northern Russia, in Scandinavia and in the wilder forests of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">east</span><span class="font11">ern Prussia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The American elk is improperly so named, through the ignorance of the early settlers. Its distinctive name is wapiti. It is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">beautiful animal, with magnificent horns, or antlers. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font11">bull elk may reach a thousand pounds in weight. It is estimated that at one time millions of these stately creatures roamed the North American continent. They are now limited in number, and confined to Wyoming. They are often found as high as 10,000 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Like the early Mormons, the wapiti are polygamous, each bull gathering a small herd of cows for his private harem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hunting the wapiti can harilly be called a sport. They are attracted by blowing a horn in imitation of the mating call. Then hunters in ambush shoot them down with repeating rifles, and, being allowed only one apiece, will select from the slaughtered group the most attractive specimen. It happens not infrequently that several are left behind wounded or dead. Other heartless men will extract the two large teeth of wapiti that have foundered in the snow. These teeth are valued as “good luck” pieces, though it leaves the animal unable to forage. The result is starvation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>The Muskdeer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The muskdeer is a comparatively small animal, not quite two feet high at the shoulders. It differs from other deer in that it has a gall bladder and caudal glands and no antlers. Its peculiar hoof formation enables it to keep its footing in rocky places, and this deer therefore is an agile animal, bounding from crag to crag with the greatest nimblencss. Its home is in central-eastern Asia and southern Siberia. It is not often found in the lowlands. The muskdeer derives its name from the fact that the male deer has a sac or gland beneath the skin of the abdomen which contains the pungent secretion that forms the basis of many of the finest perfumes. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>The Muledeer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The muledeer receives its name, not from its disposition, but from the size of its ears, which are large and outstanding but do not detract from its graceful appearance. The * fawn of the muledeer ia a dute little thing with a frank expression of wonder on its face. No doubt it finds much cause for wonder in this world where men who should be the protectors of animal life inexplicably seem to take delight in killing. The deer, of Course, does not know about the fall and the resulting sin and imperfection. But the time is at hand when it will note a change in the earth and will find that man has at last resumed his primitive role as protector and caretaker of his fellow creatures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ For a simon-pure lie the “Purgatory” business has seared more people than any other absolute fake, though the “Hell-Fire” business has partially scared millions despite the manifest absurdity of the whole preposterous thing. But it remained for one young dramatist, Orson Welles, to frighten the whole United States by radio into thinking that New Jersey had been invaded by men from Mars who were bullet-proof, and were killing right and left by means of a death ray. A church was dismissed in Indianapolis so the people could go home and die where they wanted to die. In North Carolina five college boys fainted away, and in New Jersey itself thousands got into automobiles and started at top speed for Pennsylvania. Why anybody would want to leave even New Jersey to go to a state that operates a public bakery of prisoners was not stated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ The children still in grade school have a number of lessons which often call for material outside of school. My little sister, who is just past thirteen, had to make a calendar for the month of December. Those in her room are required to make one for each month. Therefore they soon run out of different pictures, So far, by the vote of the other students, my sister had received first on almost every calendar she had- made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When December came she hardly knew what to do.

She got the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font11"> magazines out and selected the front cover of the one called “Winter Thaw”, and recopied it for her calendar.

<p><span class="font11">♦ W. II.

After citing a ease in which a half-caste girl had been chained by the neck, stripped and chased into the bush,' and another ease in which a mission had collected £700 for wild dog scalps for which it had paid the native collectors a total sum </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">but five shillings, he laid out this religious business as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">♦ The Labor government of New Zealand established a forty-hour week for labor, with a basic wage of four pounds ten shillings ($22) per week. It re-established compulsory arbitration, embarked on a huge program of public works, guaranteed prices for certain essential foods, and took virtual control of land transport. £12,000,000 of private capital was shipped out of the country (because capital has no patriotism) and then the government put a stop to it. New Zealand has for long had old-age pensions, state fire, life and accident policies, state housing and coal mining, widows’ pensions, and other legislation intended for the general welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new social security bill provides that all persons of sixty shall have an income of not less than thirty shillings per week, with free hospital and medical treatment for all, with complete universal general practitioner service. Disablement, sickness and unemployment benefits are contained in the legislation introduced. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do with Aborigines</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Australian judges are troubled to </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">know </span><span class="font11">what to do with aborigines who commit crimes. One such assaulted an cight-year-old child and was given four years at hard labor. It was established in court that these aborigines seem not to have much idea of pain, as they inflict frightful pain upon themselves, and therefore flogging seems no adequate punishment, and when they are sent to prison they all like it, thrive and grow fat, and when they come out are derelicts, divorced from their old associates and less fit for citizenship than when they were locked up. Seems as if the death penalty, the Scriptural one in some cases, might act as a deterrent; but a knowledge of God’s law is lacking in “Christendom”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font11">HE destruction of Scotland &amp;&nbsp;now well under way. The destructive forces are Italian-led anarchists, operating under guidance of the cainorra with its headquarters at Vatican City. The scene of operations is Clydebank, where the Queen Mary was recently built and the Queen Elizabeth is being fitted out for the transatlantic service of the Cunard line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy makes no effort to conceal the fact that it uses any weapon at its command to gain its ends, including murder, and therefore the inciting of riots has been and is one of its standard methods, and was used at Clydebank. Whoredom with public, officials and newspapers is another standard practice, also used to advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Riots directly incited by Roman Catholic priests took place in Clydebank on February 5, 1939, and March 5,1939. Serious injuries were inflicted upon. Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers while tltey were engaged in proclaiming their divinely directed message. Property was destroyed and persons attacked without any legal or moral justification, and the fiscal (crown prosecutor) condoned the assaults on the ground that no one has a right in Scotland to expose a religious racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There would have been no difficulty with the people if it had not been for the priests; there would have been no difficulty if the priests had not incited riots; there would have been no difficulty if the newspapers had told the truth that the priests incited the riots instead of calmed them; and there would have been no later difficulties if the police and officers of the law, including the crown prosecutor, had not betrayed Jheir oaths of office so as to curry favor with the religious politicians who travel around in black nightgowns with their collars on backward engaged in outward sanctity but within- ‘‘full of dead men’s bones and of all uneleanness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The police of Clydebank lack, the moral courage to proceed against anarchists in religious garb; they shelved any action that would expose the truth that the priests McEwen and Duffin were the direct causes of the riots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But if the Clydebank police have neither physical nor moral courage, Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers have both, and in the name and strength of their King returned 200 strong April 30. It immediately developed that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4UNE 14, 1SSB &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, </span><span class="font11">workers nearest to the houses of Baal were in the most danger. What else would one expect? Is it not known that the Devil will do all possible to protect his owjj?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On John Knox street a Christian man, 70 years of age, and short of stature, was set upon by five physically large and mentally and morally small men and nearly killed by them and by a crowd of perhaps sixty children who stoned him and two Christian women engaged with him in the good work of telling the people that now is the time to forsake religion and join themselves to Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the same street, on the same occasion, another Christian man, slightly built, and but 19 years of age, was tripped, kicked and punched, and would have been killed except for the presence with him of Christian women engaged with him in his good work. In his statement the gentleman said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At this time the crowd became very vicious and would have tom me limb from limb had it not been for the sisters. I got free from the crowd when a police officer came up on the other side of the road not twenty yards away, but the gentleman in uniform, No. D-132, never same over to help me, and at identification proceedings the next evening no one was identified as an assailant, though this officer had admitted on the day previous that be knew the men. On the day of the assault a policeman at the station remarked facetiously that he “hoped Jehovah could provide the witnesses for the identification on Monday”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On South Bank street, opposite the house of Baal called “Holy Redeemer’s Chapel”, five men kicked and punched a young man of 22, all over his body, and then partly threw him and partly pushed him down stairs. A few moments later he went to the relief of two young women, with him in the witness work, when one Catholic woman started punching, pushing and clubbing one of them. In a moment this witness, Henfy Carmichael, pioneer, was kicked and punched into insensibility in the presence of 500 to 700 people just coming out of the chapel. Some of these onlookers shouted fo the assailants to “stop it”, so disgusted were they by the cowardly attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These happenings in one-time Protestant Scotland, and-even on the street named after John Knox, its most prominent Protestant, serve as a hint that Armageddon draws nigh, which will result in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and cause rejoicing in the heart of everyone that survives.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup><a name="bookmark119"></a>y</sup> British Comment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">V. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery {London)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>“Peace”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">. • Peace between the nations is becoming almost the first desire of the peoples of earth. There is no resting from the burdens which the ambitions of the dictators of Europe have laid upon the people; nor is there any resting from the fear of the things which may break upon them like an avalanche. Britain is now deeply involved in the European political turmoil, and in a; situation which seems as touchy to explosion as the horns of a mine. The desire for peace means more than a cessation of the daily portions of reports of trouble, served up morning and evening by the newspapers and by the radio announcers. The people in Britain, as elsewhere, are now well aware that if the explosion comes most of that wealth of property and of that condition of life which has brought to some a good measure of ease, and to the majority something which meant a measure of enjoyment of living, will perish overnight. The future could not be forecast, except that it might be supposed that a ruined nation could try to make a fresh start in a ruined world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Signs are not lacking that the leaders of religion, well aware that their organizations would be broken down ' and their “causes” ruined if a world war were started, are going to try to take advantage of the desire for peace, first for the interests of religion, and as may be for the good of the people. What the archbishop of Canterbury said in the House of Lords has already been commented on. In the indirect way his place afforded him he made an appeal to the pope to eome out as the champion of peace for the world, and he (the archbishop) would round up the various church organizations in “Christendom” which are not openly affiliated with Rome. The president of the Methodist Conference has written to the pope. He said, “It is with profound satisfaction that I read the words of the archbishop of Canterbury appealing to the pope to bring together all the Christian church . . . the followers of the Prince of Peace might by such common action proclaim their complete rejection of such doctrines (of the subordination of religion to the worship of the State, and of force as the final arbiter in disputes) and their absolute loyalty to the common Master. As president of the Methodist church I would most cordially associate myself with the movement.” Quoting C. Wesley he says, “Whatever may divide us elsewhere, here, ‘Love hath rendered all distinctions void?” Dr. Wardie’s quotation from C. Wesley does not fit in the situation. The religious ' organizations do not love each other. Certainly love is not going to be the unifying power. It is fear for the things which are coming on the earth, and their threatened destruction, that is much more likely to bring them together. No doubt the “ideology” of the peace of the world will be pushed and will rally the religionists and bring them into some sort of unity. As for the pope and the “Hierarchy of Authority” he represents, they will wait their own time, and step forward when their interests are best served.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The archbishop of Canterbury was reported to be in need of a rest. Very conveniently Pierpont Morgan’s yacht was about to make a cruise in the Mediterranean, and the archbishop went with it. The yacht must have sailed direct to Greece. The archbishop attended high mass in Athens cathedral, and afterwards called on the archbishop of Athens. He purposed going on to Istanbul, where he will see the Greek patriarch. Without doubt Canterbury is working for this idea of Christian unity. The pope (Pius XII) has already invited the Greek patriarch to celebrate his coronation. The Hitler government declared its certainty that the archbishop is an active agent in British polities. Perhaps he is, but there is no question that he is a religious politician, and in his exaltation of the importance of the pope he exalts his own church racket.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>“By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">• The Advent Witness</span><span class="font11"> is the name of a monthly magazine published in London as the official organ* of The Advent Testimony and Preparation Movement. The leaders of the movement are preachers; nearly all of them carry the style “Reverend”. The editor has been pleased to make an attack on “Jehovah’s witnesses”, to expose (as he says) the errors of “this cult’’, a pieee of work which he has the right to undertake. But he goes on to utter a warning really directed against the common honesty of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He says, “In one week we had sent to us three copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font11"> by Judge Rutherford, which servant maids had been induced to purchase for 10/6d. a copy.” The statement is so obviously wrong that its publication indicates a wish to say something intended to be detiynental to Jehovah’s witnesses and the message of the Scriptures which they carry. The editor was challenged on his statements and proofs were called for, but he declined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have known Jehovah’s witnesses for many years and are intimate with their work. The editor rightly says that millions of these books are carried to the homes of the people, from door to door. Now, if in one week it happened that three maids complained of being induced to give ten shillings and sixpence for a copy of a book which is offered on a contribution of one shilling, surely these three maids could be matched with many others who could have complained of the same thing. We could challenge the preacher editor and those whom he represents to produce any one such incident, or anything like it, through all the long years this work has been going on, and out of the millions of books placed in the hands of the people. A lie is a statement intended to damage someone, and we have no hesitancy in saying there is a lie in the editor’s statement. Who the liar is perhaps he knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses seek to honor Him whose name they bear. They are servants of the Most High God, and there is not one among them who would be guilty of robbing the people, or deceiving the Society whose publications they carry with their witness. This the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Advent Witness</span><span class="font11"> editor has been told; but he has gone into silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the possible benefit of people of good will who look upon tffe leaders of that movement as holy persons who are worthy of more confidence than the ordinary orthodox parson, it seem? right not only to call attention to th« perverseness of the editor in publishing an obvious untruth, but also to say something about the general contour of the Advent Testimony’s attitude towards the message of the Scriptures which Jehovah’s people are spreading abroad as His witness to the people of good will, and His warning of judgment now hastening on to its culmination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The name they give themselves is The Advent Testimony and Preparation Movement, a name which indieat.es that its holders set themselves to prepare for a sudden revelation of Christ that at that moment they may be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JUNE 14, wsf </span><span class="font11">in a fit condition to be accepted of Him. They have no connection with the &quot;Seventh-Day Adventist” movement, but are supporters of orthodox dogmas and traditions. They differ from their fellow parsons in believing that the Lord Jesus returns, as He said, to set up His kingdom, while the parsons, following the Papacy’s lead, coneider that their task is to get the world ready for the Lord to come. That they have failed does not open their eyes, shut fast against the light of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses have for many years carried the witness that the Lord is returned; that the world ended in 1914; that then Jehovah set His King upon His holy hill of Zion, and that since 1918 a definite witness has been given of the fact of the Kingdom and the King. This witness is as obnoxious to these 'Advent Preparation’ people as it is to religionists generally. The preachers and parsons whose manifesto telling of their belief of the coming of the Lord was published throughout the earth in 1917 went in opposition to the witness then being given. These “reverend” gentlemen who have taken up the manifesto as their tradition do the same. The fact is the truth upsets their views, and its acceptance destroys their movement, and makes them what. in fact they are, misleaders of the people whom they gather round themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It would be reasonable to think that those who profess to keep themselves ready for the Lord’s acceptance at any moment would not publish perversions and misstatements about others. To aid him in his attack upon the truth and Jehovah’s witnesses the editor makes use of a pamphlet published by one of like mind as himself. It is a rather stupid affair, but the printing of the extracts from the publications of books published many years ago serves tc expose both the animosity of the opposers and also that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Advent</span><span class="font11"> editor and those whom he represents are still fast boundin the bonds and darkness of religion and its dogmas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Apparently something more than belief in the near return of the Lord is necessary for the cleansing of the mind from evil thoughts and for reception of truth. We suggest that such among them as sincerely desire to know “present truth” and be found serving the Lord by it should drop their title “Reverend”. It may be taken for granted that both the title and the dress that goes with it are effective barriers to the entrance of the truth of the Lord’s presence with His people-. Both those things represent religion, in its fundamental* error of dogma and in its conforming to the world, and surely nothing is clearer to those who know the words of Jesus and are taught of Him than this—that both religion and the world of religion and politics are in opposition to the Ruler now set on Zion. Among those who look to'the leaders of this Advent Movement, for guidance there must be some of good will towards God. Let such learn that the Scriptures are not only words of life to which they may trust, but that by His own words Jehovah is now speaking to those who arc wanting to know Him. In other words, the prophecies are now giving their message for this special time—the time of the Lord’s kingdom. Let such read that which their leaders reject and they will find the light and truth for which they seek.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>False Teachers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">• The dogmas of religion dishonor the name of God, and some are particularly harmful to those who accept them. The dogma of the Trinity, the chief dogma of &quot;Christendom” and the foundation of its theology, is the subtlest and most harmful of all. By it Satan. the Devil led the early churches away from the simplicity of the truth that God sent His Son to be the Savior of the world, and through their false teachers foisted on them a paganism covered with a mantle of Christian profession. This dogma was named the “mystery of the Trinity”. Mysteries there were and are in the Scriptures, made clear in God’s times and purpose; but this mystery is rhan-made, and instilled by the Devil, the father of lies. It is yet the girdle which keeps the priest’s robe on his back, and which enables the preachers and parsons to wear a special collar and dress. It is not to be expected that religionists will ever voluntarily let in the light of the truth and acknowledge that the Scriptures know nothing of the Trinity dogma; for if that should happen their great organizations would collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Roman Catholic writers can be franker than Protestants about the growth of this dogma, for the reason that they boldly declare their church’s authority over the Scriptures and their liberty and right to supplement the Word of God. In a new historical work by a priest the history of the &quot;mystery” is given. He admits that the early church knew nothing of it, says it was progressively unfolded, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">underwent changes before it </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">was set. It </span><span class="font11">was, he says, as the church (meaning the Roman Catholic church) reflected on the inspired writings the full meaning and importance of the Trinity was gradually brought to light. Exactly! It was the Devil’s policy to lessen the glory of God, pnd it pn»ved to be his best play to use certain words of Scripture to exalt the Bon of God, and then to make out that the Son is the same as the Father. To this dualism was added the doctrine that the spirit of God is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">person, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font11">the dogma of the Trinity was forged- Its acceptance meant that every doctrine of the epistles was vitiated, and the revelation of &quot;God, the Word of God, was made of none effect. The time is come for the judgments of Jehovah to disclose the strongholds of error, and to let the light of truth go forth through the earth for the benefit of al! who are of good will and who desire to be in harmony with truth and righteousness and the will of God. The witness from the Word of God which is carried abroad by Jehovah’s witnesses is the Word of God made plain, honoring the Father, who sent His Son into the world, and who now, in due time, has made Him His King in Zion—the first act in this great work which will end in the utter destruction of every enemy of God and the full establishment of His kingdom in the earth.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Astrology</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">• One of the means the Devil is using to keep' people from giving attention to the message of truth is by getting them to heed the tricks of astrologers. “What the stars say” is now a daily feature of some of the popular daily papers. That the messages and the prognostications differ according to the mood of the newspapers* prognosticators seems to make no difference to the dupes. The papers have found this foolishness among their readers to be a paying proposition, and it is pandered to. The astrologers themselves are going ahead. At an Astrologers’ Convention a woman lecturer said, &quot;Saturn determines the length of the parsnips, and Mars looks after the beans and radishes. ... A gardener who could get his work under the proper rule of the stars would have no need of artificial manure.” Another woman, well-informed in these matters, told the conference of the latest advance in curative medicine. &quot;You screw up some medicine in a dowser’s pendulum and swing it over the patients. The stars, it is believed, do the rest.” ’</span></p>

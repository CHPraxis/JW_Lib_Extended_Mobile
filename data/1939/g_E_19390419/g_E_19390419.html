<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Goyaz, One of Earth’s Treasure*Houses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">GOYAZ is the central state of Brazil, being the seventh in area among the twenty-one states of the republic. It is about three times as ” ' Jong as it is wide, running lengthwise north to south. Its area is 288,536 square miles, and the population is estimated at about 1,000,000, which gives a density of a little more than three inhabitants to the square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The altitude varies from 300 to 1,700 meters above sea level; the climate also varies from chilly in the elevated sections to hot and sultry in the low places near the rivers. The central high plateau forms the principal water divide of Brazil, where several of the largest rivers have their sources, amidst beautiful wild scenery. Some running east are tributaries of the Rio S. Francisco, which empties into the Atlantic at Penedo; some run south into the Rio Paranahyba, which empties into the Parana; others run west and mirth into the Araguaya and the Tocantins, which empty into the Amazon. Some geologists think that the high plateau of Goyaz was the first-dry land that appeared after the great Flood.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Agricultural Possibilities</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Goyaz being high and dry, the climate is very pleasant and in general healthful, except along the large water courses, which are malarious during several months of the year, directly after the rainy season and the overflows. But by being careful and taking certain precautions, one can avoid the malarial fevers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The southern portion of this state is composed mainly of vast rolling and level hills, covered with several varieties of coarse native grasses and, in some places, low, scrubby trees, forming thickets; in others, open pasture lands, or “campos”, as they are called in Brazil. Following the main streams there is generally a narrow or wide border of dense </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 19, 1939 </span><span class="font7">forest, where the land is very fertile’ and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font7">ductive; and here the majority of the people live and raise their crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farming is still carried on in a primitive manner. The underbrush and vines are cut with a blade about two inches wide and seven or eight in length, with a curved point, fixed to a handle four feet long; then the large trees are felled with the ax. This is done in the dry season. After two or three months the field is set on fire and all this mass of leaves, branches, creepers, etc., is burned, leaving a thick layer of ashes, and only the large trunks remaining; but these either rot, in a few years, or are reduced to ashes by succeeding fires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day after the “conflagration” the farmer begins planting his field. With the comer of the hoe he digs a shallow hole, into which a few grains of corn, rice or beans are dropped, and covers them with his foot. Generally one hoeing out is sufficient to keep down the sprouts and weeds until harvest.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Primitive Methods Still Used</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of the demonstration stations, maintained by the Federal Department of Agriculture, free advice anti valuable assistance given, even to loaning modern agricultural implements, very few farmers in this state have availed themselves of this help. So the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ma</span><span class="font7">jority of the crops, consisting of rice, corn, coffee, sugar cane, beans, cotton, potatoes, wheat, mandioca (manihot), arc still cultivated in this primitive style,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Strange to say, only a small portion of these products are shipped out of the state, due to high freight rates and lack of transportation facilities. Indeed this is the greatest hindrance to the development of the vast natural resources of this wonderful rich state of Brazil. Mandioca or maniva is the poor man’s food supply in this country, as it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">grows </span><span class="font7">on any kind of land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The. native squatter plants a small plot of ground near his dwelling, by burying short pieces of mandioca branches, and in six months he can dig out as many roots as are required for his daily consumption. If roasted in hot ashes the tubers take the place of bread; boiled with a piece of meat or fish mandioca is very palatable and nutritious. It is mostly made into flour or “farinha”, by peeling and grating the roots, then thoroughly drying while stirring in wide shallow pans over a mild fire of coals. This farinha can be prepared in many ways for the table. The stalks and roots may be left growing in the field for several years; the older, the larger they grow; some have been measured seven feet in length and have weighed 45 pounds.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Fruits of Paradise</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19390419_files/g_E_19390419-2.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:279pt;">
<p><span class="font7">On the slopes of the Andes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In the poorly-kept orchards on the farms or in the back yards of the villages are found all the tropical fruits: oranges, limes, lemons, mangoes, ma* mao or papaya, bananas, peaches, figs, mulberries, quinces, aba-cates (avocados) or alligator pears, and grapes which bear two crops a year in this state. Among the native arid wild fruits must be mentioned guavas, jaboticabas, mangabas, cajus, maracujAs, jacas, genipapos and many others. In some localities European fruits can be grown also. In the northern section of the state watermelons can be grown all the year round.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mangabeira, besides producing a very sweet-smelling and tasty fruit, gives latex which makes a good quality of rubber. In one district there are many miles covered only with wild guava trees, which produce enormous quantities, but all goes to waste. In another region one can travel for leagues through thickets of caju trees. Every year vast quantities of this useful fruit ripen, fall on the ground, and rot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Around Santa Luzia, 15 leagues from the railroad, quinces grow profusely, and the production of “marmelada”, or quince preserves, has become an industry there, and the product is sold in all the towns. On an elevated table land large quantities of arnica plant can be gathered, where it grows wild. In some places in the forest vanilla or baunilha grows and produces abundantly, but no one gathers it, although it brings a good price.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Mineral Treasures</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt Goyaz is one of the richest regions in this country in minerals. Here have been found rich deposits of iron, rutilo, nickel, gold, diamonds, mica, kaolin, slate, graphite, ocher of all colors, fine clay for brick, tile and china ware, silver, crystal, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;?he crystals from Goyaz have been pronounced of the finest grade in the world, due to not having the least trace of iron. The nickel mine near S. Josti do Tocantins extends over a large tract of land, and is second only to the famous Caledonia mine</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in quantity and percentage. Lately another large mine of the same ore has been discovered near the old capital, Goyaz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Near Trinidade, for many miles the stagnant water is covered with a film of oil smelling strongly of petroleum, showing evidence of a rich oil supply near the surface, awaiting to be tapped. Unfortunately only small amounts of these minerals, are being mined and exported at present.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Washing Out Gold by Band</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Gold is washed out in a primitive way. The gold-bearing gravel is taken, from the bottom of the rivers, or formations near a stream, and washed in a wooden basin by a circular motion, repeatedly pouring out the dirty water with tiic debris, letting in clean water by dipping the “'batea” or basin in .the stream, until only the small flakes of gold arc left with the heaviest material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To accomplish this feat advantageously, the gold-seeker must stand in the stream. Yet in this primitive manner is obtained from 15$000to 20$000. worth of gold per day, equal to about one U. S.A. dollar. When the “garimpeiro” has consumed the amount of food and “cachaga” (gin) he can purchase with that amount, then only will he go back to sock for more. The same process is employed to secure diamonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that during the time of slavery in Brazil many troops of pack mules were sent off loaded with gold from Goyaz. One of the main centers of production was around the old capital. They say that even now after a heavy rain small nuggets arc pjyked up by schoolboys from the gutters in the streets of the old city.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390419_files/g_E_19390419-3.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:288pt;">
<p><span class="font7">Goyaz, one of earth’s treasure-houses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The future home of uncounted millions; high, healthful, well-watered, fertile, productive, a land of all manner of fruits, a land of gold, diamonds, silver, fine clays, forests, fibers, great rivers and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">indeseribably beautiful religion.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">At another ancient town, Crixa,40 leagues beyond, there is a rich gold mine, now abandoned because of the distance and lack of transportation. They say that in the steeple of the old church at Crixa there is a bell, about one meter high and nearly a meter wide at the mouth, made of gold and silver taken from the mines arid cast there<sup>7 </sup>about a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After freedom was given to the slaves in Brazil, in 1888, most of the gold: mining; was abandoned in this as well as in other sections of the country. Yet at present there are many people engaged in making their living by washing out gold and diamonds by hand 'in several places in Goyaz and Matto Grosso. The larger number of “garimp ciros” collect wherever the turnout is best. At one place over 5,000 are at work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Trees That Manufacture Cloth</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">In the forests are found a great variety of medicinal herbs, beautiful orchids, valuable timbers and curious plants. The bark of one kind of trees can be stripped off in thin layers from one to two feet wide and as long as required; after drying it becomes dark brown, very strong, and a good imitation of thick cloth. Where these trees grow the Indians sew two or three strips together, which they use for blankets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many kinds of hollow canes or bamboo, of which the Indians and natives make many useful articles, such as baskets, mats, sieves, ete.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Where the roads are not suitable for oxcarts, or the people are too poor to pos-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">scenery, but cursed by sess them, all transportation is done on pack mules, the goods and farm produce being carried in large, strong baskets made of bamboo, one hung to each side of the pack saddle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The palm family is well represented in this state, as here many varieties grow promiscuously, some of them very valuable. From the leaves of one small. palm, the “tucum”, is' taken a fiber much stronger than linen, of which,the Indians make their fish lines, .nets, etc. The graceful ''burity.” in great numbers lends a distinctive mark to the landscape, with</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 18, 1938</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">its large, fan-shaped leaves growing along the banks of the streams and swampy lands. It bears several bunches a year of dark brown, varnished nuts, about the size and shape of an egg. Between the outer shell and the kernel there is a soft white mass, which can be made into a tasty and nutritious sweetmeat. Some of these bunches weigh 120 pounds. From the young leaves, torn in strips, strong cords and hammocks are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would require a volume to describe all the different kinds of palms growing wild here, but before passing *on special mention should be made of the “Babuassu” palm, the most important of all. These are encountered in untold numbers, literally covering vast tracts of land, in this as well as in other northern states. It grows everywhere, bears graceful leaves, some measuring 10 feet wide and 25 feet long. There are from 200 to 300 cocos In each cluster, from two to six clusters on a tree. From the kernels the natives prepare oil for seasoning food and for their lamps. ; A few years ago it was discovered that ba-buassu oil is a most important industrial product, splendid for lubricating purposes, and a good basis for soap manufacture; it provides a vegetable butter considered better than that from eows’ milk; it gives a combustible oil of first quality for internal-combustion motors; it is superior to kerosene oil; the shells produce more calories than mineral oil, therefore making an excellent combustible fo% railway locomotives. If there were navigation facilities available, unlimited quantities of this valuable product of nature could be easily shipped down the Araguaya and Tocantins rivers to the port of Belem on the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">azon and from there exported to foreign markets where there is a growing demand for it, thereby bringing in large capital, so much required for developing other natural resources.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>An Unexplored Utopia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">The watershed draining towards the north, composing the largest portion of the state, is covered with virgin forests and rough grazing lands, where droves of wild deer and ostriches roam at will, most of it unexplored. The land is very fertile and'.productive, and only a few scattered dwellers are found, along the large streams, who subsist mainly by hunting and fishing. Very little is known of the valuable resources to be found in this vast wilderness, lying as nature left it. A few tribes of wild Indians are found still wandering over this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Waterfalls are plentiful. The most important are found on the Paranahyba river, which marks the boundary between the state of Minas Geraes and Goyaz, The beautiful “Cachocira Dourada”, or Golden Cataract, deserves special notice, being estimated to produce electric current equal to 400,000 horsepower. There are many others of smaller capacity. Most of the principal towns have electric lights and power.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390419_files/g_E_19390419-4.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">It is almost impossible to describe the beautiful scenery on the Araguaya river, which divides Goyaz from Matto Grosso. Long stretches of wide, white, sandy beaches, where great numbers of waterfowd of many kinds and of gorgeous colors collect in search of food. Both margins of the stream, which is from a quarter to a half mile wide, present a dense wall of dark green, the outline of which is so (dearly reflected by the sunlight or moonlight, in the gently flowing waters, while droves of parrots of different sizes and bright hues fly overhead, keeping up an incessant chatter, from the small green parakeet to the large blue-black and yellowbreasted macaws, or “ar ar as”, as they are called. Then come the big “toeanos” (toucans), with yellow and red bills, eight inches in length, wearing a black coat with bright red vest; also lovely white cranes, storks, ducks and kingfishers. But lack of space will not permit a description of all the species of birds and game found in this wonderful region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This river is also famous for the quantity and variety of fish that come up every year during the overflow's to spawn? Then as the waters go down tons of fish are caught in the depressions, where they soon die and decay as the water dries away. Here many wild animals and birds of prey collect to gorge themselves. The largest fish found in this river is the ‘Tirarucu'’, sometimes w'eighing 150 pounds. &quot;When salted and dried the flesh is more nutritious than codfish.

<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Earth’s Largest Inland Island</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Many go to the Araguaya to appreciate the fine and novel scenery. At one place the river divides into two branches; the smaller, flowing to the east, is called “Brago Men or”, and the larger, to the west, “Brago Maior”; they meet again at the lower end of an island</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">300 kilometers [186 miles] long by 50 to 60 kilometers [31 to 37 miles] in width. It is considered the largest inland island in the world. It is covered with forests and fine grazing fields for raising cattle, and is inhabited by two tribes of tame Indians, the Carajfis and the Javahds, who subsist on what they can find in the woods and the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">Catholic mission post was opened there some years ago to attempt to catechize them. A Protestant missionary also opened a branch there and started teaching the Indians and Brazilian settlers, but the Catholic bishop, hearing of his activities, and having a strong pull with the state government, succeeded in having the American missionary expelled and prohibited from returning to the island during five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So in spite of separation of church and state since the advent of the republican government in Brazil, which guarantees equal freedom, to all creeds, we find the Catholic organization still holding sway and having their own way in most cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This interesting island called *Tlha do Ba-nanal” is considered one of the richest mineral regions in this state, especially in gold and diamonds. Malarial fevers and other tropical diseases during six months of the year are the principal drawbacks that hinder the development of the hidden treasures of this region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many curious and interesting insects encountered here, which cannot be described for lack of space, but, before going on, notice should be given to bees, of which there are many wild species. They produce honey, making their nests in hollow trees. Although the “Apis Melifera”, tame or European bees, are very seldom raised by the inhabitants, they are met with everywhere, making their hives and storing away large stocks of honey in hollow trees, also under the ledges of rock or in the caves on the sides of banks and cliffs, where the honeycombs reach from the roof to the floor. From one of these caves full of bees, 18 tins holding 20 liters [about 51/4 gallons] each were taken at one time full of honey.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>A Progressive Interventar</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Before November, 1937, the governors of the several states in Brazil were called presidents; since then they are called Federal In-terventors. In 1932 the present “inter vent or”, Dr. Pedro Ludovico, decided to transfer the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 19, 1939 </span><span class="font7">capital of this state from the old city of Goyaz, which is badly situated and a great distance from the railway, to a more Central and accessible point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After examining several places, finally preference was given to a nice tract of open land with a gradual slope, only 12 leagues from the present terminus of the railroad, surrounded by forests. The new capital was named Goyania. Here work soon began according to carefully drawn plans, opening wide streets and avenues, leading off from a central circular plaza, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. Around this plaza were constructed the principal public buildings, both state and federal, while the surrounding plots were sold to private individuals, who are rapidly building their modern-style bungalows for residence or for rent, besides many stores and shops. So there is much work, trading and traffic going on, and newcomers are arriving every day. What was only a grass-covered field a few years ago has now been transformed into a thriving center of activity, and it is anticipated that this infant city will soon become one of the most important in the interior of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this has been accomplished due to the courage and tenacity of one man, Dr. Pedro Ludovico, who had to overcome many difficulties and fight against much opposition. There are still some hard heads who insist and hope that the capital will be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">moved back </span><span class="font7">to the old city, which is gradually losing its importance, and many houses are being vacated. The great effort and success of this enterprise is considered one of the most important achievements in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On an elevated plateau, where the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">princi</span><span class="font7">pal rivers have their sources, 1,600 meters above sea level, a section many miles square has been surveyed and reserved by the Federal government, where, to this high, healthful spot, it is expected to move, in some future time, the capital of the republic from Rio </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">de </span><span class="font7">Janeiro.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Nearly all the towns and cities in this state are connected by motorear roads, but most </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">them are in bad condition, requiring repairs. Still a great amount of traffic is carried on by truck and motorears, in spite of the high price of gasoline, which is sold at about ten times the price at which it is delivered in Santos.

<p><span class="font7">with fixed axle, loudly screeching, drawn by from three to seven yoke of oxen, are slowly giving way to modem and more rapid means of transport. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is only one railroad in Goyaz, which reached Anapolis, the present terminus, three years ago, about 300 kilometers from the boundary with Minas Geraes. This railroad (Estrada de Ferro Goyaz) starts from Ara-guary, the terminus of the Mogyana Railroad. Due to being the stopping point of the railway, Annapolis is growing rapidly and is one of the busiest towns, as here a large amount of commerce is carried on with other districts, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">many traders, agents and tourists are constantly passing by. From S. Paulo to Annapolis takes two days’ travel by train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides this, there is another means of reaching the interior of Goyaz, by taking passage at Belem on the Amazon on one of the small steamers that make irregular trips up the Araguaya river to Leopoldina, the last port of navigation on that river; but this latter route is very seldom used, due to the time required for the trip.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Religious Racket</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">d In Goyaz, as in other places in Brazil where the Catholic priests hold sway, there are several localities where yearly festivals are held, dedicated to some of the many “saints” of their own invention. According to the fame, and material resources, a larger or smaller structure is built, erroneously called a “church”, where all the images, candles, crucifixes and other gewgaws are kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To make the business pay well, pilgrims must be attracted; so the rumor is spread relating the great healing powers attributed to that special “saint” whose name is given to the church and town. Wonderful stories are told of persons’ arriving there in the last stages of some dangerous or incurable disease and being suddenly cured by repeating </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">prayer before the image or by using some &quot;Agua Benta”, that is, water “blessed” by the Catholic priest. So the fame spreads far and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before a certain day set for the opening of festivities, which sometimes last from eight to fifteen days, people begin to arrive from every direction, some taking more than a month to make the trip. They come on foot, and on horseback, but most of them travel in oxcarts, covered with dried raw hides, like the old-time covered wagons used en route to the California gold fields before the railroads were built. Some come in simple faith to fulfill a promise made to one of the “saints” during the year; others, tor curiosity; but most of them come to make money by trading and gambling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Temporary sheds covered with' palm leaves and tents are set up all round the “church”; among these gambling stands are in evidence, as all kinds of betting is allowed. The people require food ; so some fix up stands to sell coffee, bread, sandwiches, hot-dogs, rum, etc. Temporary barber shops arc plentiful; trinkets, toys, cosmetics and articles of wear of every description are spread on tables or on the ground, all trying to make the best of the opportunity to make their racket pay the most.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Biggest Rake-Off</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">But the main racket is in the hands of the priests, who make themselves conspicuous, moving among the crowds, dressed in black gowns, red socks and queer three-cornered hats, ever ready and waiting to receive the presents of every description and sums of money offered to the “saint”, from poor and rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So between the pickpockets, gamblers, and the priests, the poor ignorant people are robbed of their hard-earned savings during the year; but the pope’s agents generally get the lion’s share of the rake-off. Naturally the main attraction of the show is the procession. Two lines of little girls take the lead, dressed in white, with wings on their shoulders to appear as angels ; then come several images, each one supported on poles, carried on the shoulders of four men; next the chief priest walking with solemn stride, with his eyes fixed on a little book held in his hand; a silver crucifix hangs below his waist, suspended by a cord around his neck; a yellow' eanopy with gold embroidery is carried over his head, attached to poles held by four lackies walking at his side; then come other priests with sedate faces, followed by the brass band playing an anthem in a subdued and measured tone; next come two files of men dressed in purple mother-hub bards, carrying lighted candles in their hands; then in the rear the people follow in a solid mass, all trying to keep as near as possible to the main aefor in the show.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">procession follows a certain route </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">around </span><span class="font7">the church square or through the streets of the town, all looking as grave as possible. Then as the parade returns and the images begin entering the church door, the bells start ringing, dozens of sky-rockets shoot up, each one carrying three bombs which explode high in the air, and at short intervals larger bombs fixed to a frame in front of the church fall as the fire releases them and burst with a loud report equal to a cannon. As the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font7">enter the door each one makes the sign </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the cross. On the last day of the festa an auction is held, at wdiich most of the presents </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">offered </span><span class="font7">to the “saint” are sold to the highest bidder. This is a great source of revenue for the “church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is strange </span><span class="font7">to see the variety of articles </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that are </span><span class="font7">offered: from a yoke of oxen down </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to cakes, </span><span class="font7">bordered cushions and towels, etc. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">At one </span><span class="font7">of these heathen feasts held yearly it was estimated that about 5,000 oxcarts were seen at a place called “Agua Suja”, that'is, Dirt/ Water; quite appropriate when considering the number of dirty lies taught by the crafty Catholic priests.—Vergilio Ferguson, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Brazil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ A picturesque feature of Sao Paulo life is doomed to pass away with the advance of “civilization”. Already an ordinance has been passed forbidding goats as well as cows to be driven through the streets and milked at the doors of the houses. The cows have disappeared, but the patrons of goat milk raised such a clamor of protest that the ordinance has not yet been enforced so far as the goats are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes the goat herders are as sharp bargainers as the venders of other wares, In </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">certain home, agreement was made to furnish a half liter of milk each morning at a stipulated price per month. A pitcher with a mark indicating y<sub>3</sub> liter [about a pint] was taken out every morning to be filled. For a time all went well, but after </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">while it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">noticed thqt, although the pitcher came in brimming over with foam, after a few minutes the foam was gone and about half a glass of milk was lacking. Upon close observation it was nofed that the goat girl held the pitcher at some distance from the goat’s bag, thus giving much foam and less milk. When this had continued for a time, it was called to her attention that the milk supply was short and that there was too much foam. With a serious countenance she said: “Ah! that is because the black goat is not being milked now. She doesn’t give so much foam. Please excuse,” —Maud B. Yuille, Brazil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ It was on a Sunday, February 24, 1924, that WBBR sent its first scheduled radio program to a small but eager and excited metropolitan radio audience. We say “a small audience” because in those days tadio was young and few were the “bugs” that expended time on this new contraption that within a decade was to revolutionize and so vitally affect the educational, so-eial, entertainment — yes, even political and economic — structure of the world. Today—only fifteen years later —there are ten million radio sets within the hearing of WBBR and few people anymore would think of getting along without a radio in the home. Radio has assumed a dominant place in the educational and economic life of the present generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of all the stations in the world, WBBR stands unique. All God-fearing and honest persons will admit that the most worth-while —in fact, the only really worth-while—cause 'to which any radio station can be devoted is the: honoring of Jehovah God and the unselfish service of man. Present greedy and selfish world conditions serve but to emphasize this point.

WBBR has established an enviable reputation for its consistently good music, but the really distinctive and most noteworthy feature of its history is the message of hope and comfort from the Scriptures, sent daily to a bewildered and heart-sick public, in the Bible lectures of Judge Rutherford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kingdom Instruction, by this the world’s foremost Bi</span><span class="font7">ble authority, not only is a well-liked feature at WBBR, but is, in fact, the very cornerstone on which the station rests. What other radio station in the world is exclusively devoted to informing the people of God’s Kingdom as the only hope of the world ? How many stations on your dial ignore the commercial opportunities of radio broadcasting so that they might the better serve people of good will with information worth more than all the silver and gold? What other radio station in the world day after day deals out the life-giving truths from God’s Word? Surely you will agree that WBBR occupies a position unique in radio broadcasting! And who is responsible for all this? Certainly no man. The radio belongs to God, who created it. It appears to be the Gord's good pleasure to maintain, in a world that so wantonly misuses all of His handiwork for selfish gain, one radio station which is truly devoted to His service and immovably stands for the honor of His name. Truly then, even as many of you in your fan mail attest, WBBR is more than just “another radio station”. It is part of Jehovah’s publicity channel, set apart from Satan’s commercial organization. God’s manifest blessing on WBBR during the past fifteen years is the best commentary on the public interest, convenience and necessity so adequately served by this station.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Here is a good one; too good to keep. My husband is the editor of a daily newspaper with a'wide circulation. Yet he goes all over the city in the witness work and tells the people that “among all the newspapers and magazines, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> is the only one that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IS NOT AFRAID TO PUBLISH THE TRUTH, </span><span class="font7">because it carries no advertising and is not controlled by Big Business”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the late </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font7"> have been strongly advocating keeping the sound equipment working. We wonder how many others are realizing the joy we are experiencing in having Judge Rutherford accompany us nearly every place we go and give warning and instruction to the people concerning Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We secure all the neighborhood territory on every side, and then we make a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font7"> call on our neighbors. They hear the message and nearly always get it also in printed form, and they invite us back. When we go back, it is with the phonograph and they know just what to expect. We never take time to visit friends or relatives or attend parties or other gatherings without the phonograph. If we call on someone in the hospital, we take the phonograph and let all in the ward hear the message of good cheer. We spend from five to ten hours on Sundays working with the phonograph, and Saturday afternoons and nights. We find no better time to work with the phonograph than nights; for often all the family are home and at leisure and sometimes guests are being entertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let none think they must have a car to work thus with a phonograph. We have no </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">car, </span><span class="font7">and have walked as far as twelve miles </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">a Sunday. Each day our joy increases for the manifold privileges and blessings Jehovah bestows upon us, and, by His grace, we shall never falter or slack oiir hands in this grand </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What eharm does Judge Rutherford’s voice </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">hold </span><span class="font7">for little canaries? and what terror does it strike to the hearts of &quot;dumb dogs” ? These thoughts come to mind in our experience with the phonograph. So many homes have canaries, but we do not see them as we enter, and not till Judge Rutherford’s voice begins to resound through the room telling about God’s kingdom of peace and righteousness. Then the canaries join with J. R. in a duet, almost bursting their throats with the melodious strains, and when the record is completed they are silent. Are they, we wonder, singing for joy, looking forward to the time of which J. R. is speaking: the time of their release, when they shall be free to join their feathered friends in the beauteous woodland?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As, from time to time, the dogs slink under the stove to hide, growling throughout the phonograph talk, we wonder, Is this a picture of the real dumb dogs (Isa. 56:10) who really growl when they hear the message of truth pointing to the time of their utter banishment, their final exit,—not under the stove, but into oblivion ?—-Mrs. Benjamin F. Myers, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">P.S. My husband had the “Safety” record on at the home of Mr. and Mrs. H. C. McElwain in this town. Baby Frances, 18-month-old, seemed entranced and stood beside the phonograph, which had been placed on a chair, listening in intently all the time. She is not able to talk much yet, but when the vast audience shouted “Aye” the little darling came in at the end with her “Aye” so loudly that it almost frightened us all. “A little child shall lead them.” Of course her parents got the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font7"> book.</span></p>

The same State Department of Justice should now demand amnesty for the gentlemen in charge of Holmesburg, Pennsylvania, prison who baked four prisoners to death. Also, the legislature should send a committee to Germany to ascertain the latest achievements in eussedness and meanness, and after submit- ting them to Cardinal Dougherty, put them into effect in the state that was once the state of William Penn—the only state in the United States where the Indians ever received a square deal.

When the machines thus patented are in operation the pressing of a single electric button will produce twenty-six full-fashioned stocking blanks at a time, with the result that a single operator will then be able to operate an entire factory. Here is a nice question for the wise. They will now rise up and explain (after they have shown what great profits will accrue to the owners of the machines) just what will be done with the thousands of expert operators in hosiery mills that will thereafter not be needed at all. If they were men it would be easy: start another war and kill them off. But they are women, and it is the women, principally, that wear the full-fashioned silk hose; and it is not so clever, after all, to kill off all your customers.</span></p>

They surrender it with a tremendous gesture and then say: “What will you give us in return ?”</span></p>

She loaded 1,800 families, containing some 20,000 individuals, in twenty ships and carried them across the Mediterranean. There the families were provided with 1,800 automobiles and taken to neat little homes, made and furnished at government expense. On arrival at their future homes the colonists were given the keys to their dwellings, as well as to their barns, and when they entered the latter they found the agricultural implements and the seeds which they need to put in their first crops. Schoolhouses and hospitals and other accouterments of civilization were all completed before a colonist arrived.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Misguided</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7"> WRITER in the Miami (Fla.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font7">says, in substance, that every Christian should salute the flag when requested to do so; and in support of that claim she quotes the, words of the apostle, to wit: “Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well.”—1 Peter 2:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the surface that scripture may seem to support the claim of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> writer, but in truth and in fact it has no reference whatsoever to the officers that govern this world or to any earthly laws. Note now that the apostle directs his epistle to the “elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father”. His admonition is given for the benefit of the church of God, that is to say, for the guidance of those persons on earth who have devoted themselves to God and Christ and who are diligently striving to walk in the way of righteousness. The apostle Paul, addressing Christians, said: “Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. . . . Keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.” (1 Corinthians 11:1,2) Peter and Paul were specifically commissioned by the Lord to make ordinances or rules for the guidance of the Christians, and in doing so they acted upon the command and commission of the great Theo-crat. For that reason their epistles were written for the instruction and guidance of the church, and such epistles were written under inspiration and the direction of the Lord. They were addressed to none other than the truly consecrated Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having this clear setting in mind, note then the words in the scripture cited first above, to wit: “Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake.” The apostles are the ones referred to in the Words 'ordinances of man’, because they promulgated such ordinances or rules for the governing of the eon-gregations and did so at the command of the Lord. It is absolutely certain that their ordinances had nothing whatsoever to do with flag-saluting. The apostle continues, “Whether it be to the king, as supreme.” These words, “the king, as supreme,&quot; have no reference whatsoever to earthly rulers, but apply to Jehovah God, who is the King of eternity, the Supreme One above all. “[Jehovah] is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king.” (Jeremiah 10:10) Continuing, the apostle says in the text first cited, “or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him.” This had no reference to the governors of states or nations of earth, but to the governors of the church of God and which Christ Jesus by authority of Jehovah God has provided. Christ Jesus is the Head of the church and is the Governor thereof, and He specifically chose the apostles to act for Him and in His name. They were the ones commissioned to promulgate the necessary rules for the guidance of the congregations on earth. Those apostles were “sent by him [Christ Jesus the Lord] for the punishment of evil doers” in the congregation “and for the praise of them that do well”. That they exercised that authority, note the account at Acts 5:1-6. Paul, by authority from the Lord, delegated both to Timothy and to Titus to announce certain rules and to act as governors of the congregations to which they were sent. (1 Timothy 5:20; Titus 1:13; 2:15) The apostles and their delegated representatives made and announced “ordinances” which were the ‘ordinances of man’, made under the Lord’s direction for the government of men who were of the congregation. This is the true meaning of the words of the apostle Peter, which apply exclusively to those men and women on earth forming congregations which are devoted to God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mark how unreasonable, yes, even ridiculous, it would appear to apply the apostle’s words to the ordinances made by school boards, city councils, legislators, or Congress. For instance, in some jurisdictions it is unlawful to have in possession or sell intoxicating liquor. That was particularly true for a number of years in the United States. In other jurisdictions bordering the United States it was entirely lawful. For instance, between Canada and the United States there is an imaginary line dividing the countries. The ordinances on the points mentioned here were exactly contrary the one to the other. Which should the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christian obey? God does not recognize any earthly divisions of land by imaginary lines. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">man may have part of his possessions in the United States and part in Canada. He is in one country one day and in the other the next. As a further illustration: The dictator Hitler demands that every person must give a certain salute to him and say “Heil Hitler!” meaning, “Salvation comes from Hitler.” Sure</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ly </span><span class="font7">the Lord could not command everyone to obey that ordinance of a worldly man, because the same is absolutely contrary to God’s Word. —Exodus 20:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">School boards make ordinances commanding every child to salute the flag and sing certain songs which attribute salvation to what </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">flag or song represents. The child has been told by its parents to believe in the Word of God and to obey that Word. The child says, “I cannot salute the flag, for the reason that, if </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">do so, I am violating the commandment of Jehovah God, because He has commanded His people not to attribute salvation to any power except Jehovah.” Humans can’t provide salvation themselves. It is wTitten in the Scriptures, “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” (Psalm 3:8, A.R.V.) To obey worldly ordinances contrary to God’s ordinances means to lose God’s favor, and, therefore, to lose everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In truth and in fact, compulsory flag-saluting is a scheme hatched in recent months by Satan and is a subtle means of turning men away from God and requires them to give devotion to men and is an attempt to cause God’s covenant people to violate their covenant with Jehovah. One who truly loves Jehovah God will not willingly violate His covenant, and therefore one devoted to God and Christ Jesus cannot </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">heil</span><span class="font7"> Hitler or any other man, cannot salute any flag and thereby attribute to such man or flag protection and salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great difficulty with such as the writer in the Miami </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> is that they are misguided. They apply the Word of God to organizations that are in opposition to God. They appear to believe that worldly governments are established and directed by Almighty God, whereas the Scriptures plainly state that Satan is the invisible god or ruler of this world. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Men have organized governments with good intentions of having a rule for the benefit of the people, but such rulers, failing to give heed to the Word of God and going contrary to God’s will by giving praise and devotion to creatures instead of the Creator, have fallen under the influence of the Devil and have been blinded to God’s purpose concerning mankind. Selfish men who follow this course God has permitted to go their own way. (Romans 1:21-24) Christians give their allegiance to Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and they obey His laws, and every law of the land that is in harmony with God’s law or commandments they obey; but when an ordinance or law commands them to do what Jehovah God’s law plainly forbids, then the Christian will obey God and not man. The apostles blazed the way in this regard when they stated before worldly courts: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto' you more than unto God, judge ye.” “We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 4:19; 5:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ An Italian scientist, Commendatore Salemi, working with an English scientist, Prof. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">F, C. </span><span class="font7">Lea, has produced a new form of power transmission, clutchless and gearless, which bids fair to revolutionize motoring on land, on sea, or in air. The man at the wheel in an automobile has nothing to think of but to steer the car and to use the right foot to accelerate or reduce speed. The only lever to use is the one that puts the ear in reverse. Trials at Cambridge, England, seem entirely satisfactory. The car accelerates to 30 miles an hour in six seconds from the moment of starting, and has been subjected to 65,000 miles </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of ac</span><span class="font7">tual driving.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ A motorist who drives safely without ever using a horn is in favor of elimination of auto horn. His suggestion will meet with the approval of most pedestrians daily startled unnecessarily by blasts that upset their nerves without the slightest reason. If a man cannot drive safely without using a horn to deprive other people of their rights, he should not drive at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦It not infrequently occurs that a person meets with an accident that automatically does for him what would otherwise require the services of an osteopath or chiropractor. Such an accident occurred at Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Joseph Havelka, Jr., was instantly cured of a case of stuttering which had afflicted him for twelve years. The patient was in a wheel chair, when he was accidentally struck by an automobile. Too bad he did not visit someone who could have given him a much-needed spinal adjustment twelve years earlier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ In the 17 weeks between July 20 and November 15 the “Reverend” Panos Constanti-nides, pastor of the Greek Orthodox Church of Atlanta, Georgia, received 13 summonses for illegal parking, reckless driving, leaving the scene of an accident, running past stop signs, etc. He ignored all but the last, and then suddenly found he had to stand trial for the whole thirteen. Such is life. Only a religious racketeer would have the effrontery to do a thing of this kind. The whole gang are a menace to humanity, and a curse.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Took Just One Week '</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ It took just one week for the Roman Cath-olie Hierarchy to wallop the city of Cincinnati into submission on the Bingo business. If any particularly dirty business has to be done in the open it seems that it is the ehan-cellor that has that end of it. The reason for this is that thus the Arch Bish Hop can keep his skirts (dear and put on that holy air so much sought in the pictures that flood the public press. So it was the ‘‘Reverend Father” Monsignor Mr. Sir Matthias Heyker, chancellor of the archdiocese of Cincinnati, that broke the ice in a column article in the Cincinnati </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer,</span><span class="font7"> November 17, in which he ■stated that while Bingo and other gambling is illegal, yet it is all O.K. with the outfit with which he is connected. That put the heat on the politicians, as it was intended to do, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Star</span><span class="font7"> of just a week later stated that by a vote of six to three the city council had agreed to let the Roman Catholic Hierarchy go ahead and violate the state law and nothing would be done about it unless the courts ■interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The regulations as finally adopted by the city council arc laughable. They stipulate that gambling awards must not exceed $100; that the prizes must not exceed 25 percent of the gross receipts ; that if the gambling racket is held more frequently than once a quarter it must not be advertised; that the police must be tipped off 24 hours before the gambling starts (so that they can keep out of the way, or arrest any law-abiding citizen that complains that the law is being violated) ; that a certified statement of attendance, receipts, prizes and expenses must be given to the police within </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">24</span><span class="font7"> hours after the affair is over; and that the only ones that may, thus violate the law must have been in existence not less than five years. This proposal, that a thing that has been decayed five years or more has superior sanctity in the eyes of the law over an institution that is less than five years of age is one of the funniest things ever advanced in legal history. Even the youngest American child, unless he has been “educated” in a pa-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rochial school, knows perfectly well that all persons and corporations are equal in the eyes of the law. What is legal for one is legal for another, and what is illegal for one is illegal for another. The city council of Cincinnati needs to soak its head.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Good Place to Plead Tolerance</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ There probably is not a better place in the United States to plead for tolerance than Seattle, particularly since Gerald Bishop Shaughnessy did his level best to prevent Judge Rutherford from speaking there, and subsequently bluffed and bulldozed the radio stations into apologizing for broadcasting the very things the people need to hear, and boycotted the radio stations’ advertisers, and without a doubt bullyragged the city council into preventing Judge Rutherford from again speaking-from the municipal auditorium, and cheap-skated the Seattle papers into folding up like an aceordeon and refusing to carry out their contracts to publish, at a price, news of the utmost importance. Well, Seattle has had a fine “Religious Unity Aim” meeting. This time Shaughnessy discreetly stayed out of the picture, but he put everybody else in. The governor of the state was there, Rabbi Rosenberg was there, the general secretary of the Y.M.C.A. was there, and all that Mr. Shaughnessy had to do was to say, after it was ail over, “Boys, you did a good job; between you, you pulled over another good one on the people, and after a few more just like it the people, the poor suckers, will forget altogether about the rotten deal given to Jehovah’s witnesses when they came to this intolerant and narrow-minded bailiwick of our lord god the pope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Revenue Must Be Falling Off</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">❖ Junction City, Ohio, fifty miles southeast of Columbus, Ohio, feels the heat, or at least “Reverend Father” Eugene Owens, guiding star of St. Patrick’s church, indicates that he does, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The. Catholic News.</span><span class="font7"> It is quite an interesting paper, four pages all told. The first page is given up to the philosophy which includes the aphorism “Ignorance is bliss”, and, being situated right under the pictures of the church and parsonage, seems to be in the right place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Page two is wholly given over to the proposition that “God blesses the । cheerful giver”, and lists by name five that dug up $3 each in September, eleven that were made to disgorge </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">$2 </span><span class="font7">each, three that parted with $1.50 each, 34 that were mulcted out of $1 each, 13 that let loose of 50c each, and one that gave $1.25. Following the list is the statement, “Honesty is the best policy.” Too bad that “Reverent!&quot; Owens did not think of this before he got those poor sinners to turn over $83.25 to him for which they get nothing in return, not a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fourth page contains a front and side view of the parsonage; looks like a twelve-room house. What on earth could a “celibate” man want with all those rooms?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it is the third page chiefly that is interesting. It is wholly devoted to hammering Judge Rutherford. Wonder why. Briefly mentioning </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The, Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> [now </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation],</span><span class="font7"> it says succinctly : “The latter is published in 12 languages.

Skelly, C.M., Director, 100 East Price street, Germantown, Philadelphia, Pa., seems to be doing a good business in so-called sterling silver, nickel silver, silver plate, rolled gold, brass inlay, brass tips, bronze finish and other medals, chains, crucifixes, rosaries, pendants, beads and other merchandise of no value to anybody. Persons who dig up 25c a year for their friends who are dead either mentally or physically or both can get this stuff and in years to come look at it and think how foolish they were to bite, and to part with their money to help along the biggest fraud on the footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Skelly’ tells about some of the “favors” that come to persons who purchase the junk. Here is one about an old gentleman that was</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ “liever end Father” P. C. Depew, of Perryopolis, Pennsylvania, is some shepherd of the flock, the shearing of which flock is his life business. He operates certain property tax - free as </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">charitable institution, but all the residents thereof pay rent, except two blind men who do chores for their upkeep. One of the tenants was Charles Clary, whose five children just had the measles. He got behind in his rent and the “Reverend Father” Depew had the family put off the property, and that night they slept on a slate dump. Residents of Uniontown talked of hanging the “Reverend Father”, but at length decided not to do anything to interfere with the holy racket in which he is engaged. The headlines of the Uniontown paper that carried the story said sympathetically:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Consider those headlines for a minute and see if their plain intent is not to draw sympathy to the “Reverend Father” Depew, rather than to the poor family that he forced in sickness and in poverty to sleep out in the open, in April, in the mountains of western Pennsylvania.

Now the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, being very law-abiding, were only going to chance off and gamble away everything except the nuns, tax-free real estate and priests. Everything was being put in shape, wheels of fortune oiled up, and brakes tightened in preparation for fleecing the flock, when, lo and behold, their own “higher powers”, the sheriff of Licking county, descended upon them like a cloud of gloom and enforced the law; and is somebody’s face red ? Catholics from all over Ohio were there, and are still wondering if gambling is more sacred than the divine right of politicians, and, if so, how old is Anne, god’s Boman Catholic grandmother.

It seems that he agreed to settle the General Equipment Cases for $85,000, aud a cheek of the city was given for that amount, but before the check was paid over Mr. Curley, well taught in the greatest of all rackets, wanted to know, “What is there in it for me!” The answer was that there would be $40,000, but for some unexplained reason only $30,000 of the graft was counted out into his itching palm. Probably some other grafter stole the other $10,000 en route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Splendid Example of Tolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Kansas City edition of the Catholic boiler-plate weekly, known as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Register, </span><span class="font7">tells of “a splendid example of toleration and co-operation” in Salt Lake City, engineered and sponsored by John J.

Looks as if Britain would have a warm time keeping the Wall intact.

He did not see the self-evident truth that the organization baric of the terrorism there is the organization which is itself back of both the Fascist and the Nazi terrors, blessed their murders in Spain and did not hesitate to use the Arabs of northern Morocco to accomplish its ends in the re-establishment of complete clerical domination of the Spanish peninsula.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ When trouble arose between Arabs and Jews in a village concerning the use of a well, the Military Governor drew attention to the new settlement of the Jews, clothed in luxuriant foliage, a veritable oasis of beauty in a barren environment. Then he asked the Arabs, “How long have you been here ?” “Since creation,” they answered, “at least a thousand years.” “And how long have the Jews been here?” he queried, and the Arab villagers replied, “Not more than ten years.” “Then why haven’t you planted a single tree in a thousand years, while the Jews have planted a forest in ten years?” sharply came the unanswerable question which was an effective reply to their complaint.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Exchange.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The law in Palestine makes the possession of arms and ammunition subject to the death penalty. Crimes with deadly weapons continue almost daily, and the Arabs have shown themselves adepts in dodging blame and putting the blame on the innocent. In one instance an Arab used a messenger to send a revolver to a younger brother with whom be had quarreled over an inheritance, and, as soon as he knew it had been “planted”, reported to the police, with the result that both were imprisoned, the younger for one year, himself for seven years.

<p><span class="font7">A study of vaccines for the common cold, tried on twenty thousand persons, shows that none of them reduced the number of colds. (Page 50)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">... as the composition of horse dung; house dust; glue and street dust is indefinite, it is irrational to test the hypersensitivity of a patient by means of a stock preparation; instead, an extract should be prepared from material which is likely to correspond with that to which a patient is sensitive.

<p><span class="font7">♦ The joy of International Murderers, Inc., reaches to the skies. The world’s armament bill for 1938 went up to $16,000,000,000, showing a rise of $2,500,000,000 over 1937. The seven terrors of the world, United States, Britain, France, .Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan, accounted for $12,528,000,000 of the total. The people that make the arms are delighted to sell them to anybody that will buy, and even to send demonstrators along to show them how to get the greatest results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ What gang is it that wants war, and hopes to get control of the entire country the moment it breaks out?

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>New York’s Temple of Religion</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">THOSE that are in the religious business will tell you right away that what the world needs is more religion, their reason for that being that they want to keep their jobs. The number of sects fluctuates somewhat from year to year. In 1917 there were 210 listed. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World Almanac</span><span class="font7"> for 1919 listed 201. A year later the Federal Council of Churches reported 194. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World Almanac</span><span class="font7"> for 1938 lists the general headquarters of the 64 largest ones. The other 150, or thereabouts, are considered small fry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a vague suspicion that all </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is not </span><span class="font7">well with the religious business; so the New York World’s Fair will have a Temple of Religion. A few suggestions might be in order; so here goes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Would </span><span class="font7">it not be a good idea to have a porthole in the temple for locating the new moon 1 In London there is a church of 30 men and women that worship the moon, and every time there is a new moon they bow three times with their heads to the ground and sing moon songs to their hearts’ content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There could be a dungeon in the cellar for the Satan-worshipers of Iraq. Maybe a few Iraqi might like to come along. So why not make them welcome? It could be explained to them that there are millions of Americans who do not believe there is any Devil, or even that there is any God. But they shouldn’t be shut out of the temple; they should have a run for their money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There should be a stable on the thumb-hand side of the temple in which to keep the sacred horse Trancelim, a race-horse worshiped in a section of Brazil. Brazilians could be told that many Americans worship the Democratic jackass, while a few worship the elephant of pre-Hoover days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The marriage- chapel will be needed. There the Turanian couples can come, a priest can puncture the arms of bride and groom and draw off some blood, and then they can drink some of the blood while the rest of it Is burned in a bonfire. The Queens Fire Department will keep an eye on the fire. Or will it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They might have a fire-walking exhibit in some mystic part of the lawn, made by a steam shovel out of the mud of Flushing meadows. If any fire-walkers come over from India they will naturally want to put on a little show to prove that their religion is just as good as those of the bombers of women and children.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>New York Should Step on It</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">John D, Rockefeller, Jr., gave $25,000 for this temple, and if he wants to get anything back on his investment the show ought to be good. How about getting one of those leopardmen from Africa ? Maybe he could be excused from prison long enough to show how he donned leopard skin and socked razor-edged hooks into enemies. Big Business ought to be able to learn something from this. The leopard-men had a ritual, which was religious, of course. Cannibalism was one of the features. This also ought to appeal to Big Business. The Belgian government put most of the leopardmen behind bars, thereby discouraging religion. New York can correct this and put the leopard-men back in good odor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There should be a stage for Aimee Semple McPherson, and if she could just be induced to put on her great disappearance act, in all its details, as it was carried out with one of her handsqjne male organists ten years ago, here is guaranteeing that there would not be enough people left in New York and Brooklyn to even watch the properties, let alone do business. The trouble with all this religious business in the past has been the cheap-skate way in which it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A big padded cell would be needed to show up properly the details of the great Koreshan cosmic shell. People! who think this world is round like the outside of a ball instead of round and hollow like the inside of an orange peel need more religion. Give the Koresh boys a break. They need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A platform in front could be set aside for the holy whirling dervishes. That would draw a crowd, and besides, it is religious. A good religious guy among the whirling dervishes can spin like a top for three minutes at a stretch and his skirts will stand out from his hips all the time like those of a ballet dancer. Just a soft note here. Wonder if among those whirlers they could not find a few of the good-looking Moslem females, give them souls (which according to Moslem theology they lack) and teach them the whole business. This would whoop up the attendance a lot. Men that wouldn’t give a plugged nickel to see a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">man whirl his head off would come from far and near to see a nice-looking girl whirler.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>How About Voliva?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Times have changed. There was a time when John Alexander Dowie could blow in $300,000 in a spectacular scheme to bring religion to New York, but he lost his wad and now his successor, Wilbur Glenn Voliva, lives in two rooms in the old mansion at Zion City, without any servant to attend him. For old times’ sake have a religious side show where Voliva could be one of the features. Many would pay a nickel apiece to see a man who believes the earth is flat and who claims to be a Christian and at the same time denounces the Lord’s prayer because it is a Kingdom prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A cemetery could be opened and the body of Mrs. Cecilia Novarro could be reinterred there. She was buried alive in California by seven religious persons because she violated some clause in the secret religion to which she belonged. All murderers, including the 10,000 that escape the penalty every year, as well as all munition makers, should be interested in this religion.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390419_files/g_E_19390419-24.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">A restaurant could be opened for any cannibals that might like to come. The Holmesburg prison at Philadelphia might be persuaded to do the cooking. Cannibalism is something religious. Maretu, a Cook Islander who became a missionary, describes the fat of man as being delicious, tasting and smelling much better than either fish or hog. Not sure about this, but religion ought to settle it. In the restaurant there could be a booth for the Swiss lemon eaters, who believe that when a person is buried the coffin should be decorated with lemons and plenty of lemons be thrown into the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other side of the restaurant the Hungarian League of Laughter that believes it is religious to laugh about everything, no matter what it is, would be a sort of offset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Penitentes of New Mexico could put on a crucifixion scene more realistic than the one at Oberammergau, after which it is aped. They occasionally kill people at this barbarism, imported from Europe centuries ago. One would have to see this in order to appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Purgatory” and “Hell-Fire” religions are too horrible to be exhibited; nevertheless they will be the principal exhibits at the Temple of Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Temple of Religion is a clever idea, perhaps. The more religions exhibited, the clearer it will be that Christianity is something wholly apart.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Welfare Island, Nice Place</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The cancer hospital on Welfare island, New York city, where the poor are cared for, is a wooden firetrap seventy-five years old and so infested with ants that the only way to clean it is to take it down, burn it, dig a new cellar and throw the excavated material into the ocean. As late as November, 1938, though by superhuman efforts the kitchen and operating room were kept free of vermin, a cancer patient who had had a breast removed was found with hundreds of ants crawling over her, and in the whole building there were rats, miee, cockroaches, bedbugs and ants galore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Innocent Custodians of Public Safety</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Newburgh, New York, has some innocent custodians of public safety. It seems that a girl in the town had a bank account of $468,000 two' weeks after she was employed. Also, one 10,000-gallon whisky still was located only 200 yards from the city hall. Just a suggestion here. If it had been operated in the police headquarters there would have been less chance of somebody’s squealing. Well, all good things come to an end; and so, after 44 men and this one woman had gypped the state out of $7,500,000 in taxes, and the Government out of $15,000,000, they were caught.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Benjamin Kotlowitz, now 113 years of age, fled to this country in his youth, to escape persecutions in his homeland, Russia. He was only 80 when he came over; that was in the year 1905, or 33 years ago. He has 108 descendants in five generations, and at his birthday party, the other day, was the life of the party. He received congratulatory letters from President Roosevelt, Governor Lehman and Mayor La Guardia. About 400 friends attended his party.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Political Chessboard</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">• Some smart moves arc being made on the Devil’s chessboard of European politics. The Devil, the enemy of God and of the kingdom of Christ, is stirring up strife in his war to prevent the full establishment of that kingdom in the earth. (See Revelation 12:12.) But his army is a mixed crowd, each lot with its own interests to serve, and the Devil must play one section against another in order to gain his ends. At the present time there is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">contest between Britain and France, on the one hand, and Mussolini and Hitler, on the other, with Franco’s friendship as prize. Franco now sees himself as master of Spain and it appears he wants to have Spain under his control without the overlordship of Mussolini; he wants to have Spain at liberty to act for itself. Mussolini has not caused Italy to shed its blood and spend its money for Spain’s freedom, nor to see that country onee again under the rule of the pope. Spain under his control means all the difference between his being master of the Mediterranean, holding a strong hand against France and Britain, and being weakened in his purpose. Britain and France need the friendship of Spain for similar reasons. A quick move in the game was made by Britain when, unexpectedly, a warship was sent to Minorca to take off the few representatives of republican Spain, leaving the island to Franco’s men. The island was a particularly desirable portion of Mussolini’s expectation, for with control of it Italy could prevent France’s sea communication with North Africa, and very greatly jeopardize Britain’s route to Palestine, Egypt and the Far East. The action vexed Mussolini, but greatly helped Franco. It seems that Italy may not get nearly as much out of its Spanish venture as was expected. Franco will want money for the restoration of the desolated country, and neither Germany nor Italy is in position to lend what is necessary, and Britain and France are able. If Mussolini should say that it is by Italy’s help Franco has got Spain, it can be said as truly that the non-intervention policy of Britain has been of equal service.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>Roman Catholicism and Fascism</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">• Cardinal Hinsley, archbishop of Westminster, warns the flock in England against talking so freely about Fascism as might create the thought that they arc allied. He does not want the Fascist label put on Roman Catholicism. That there is a. close connection is apparent, and the cardinal can blame the Roman Catholic! journals in Britain for his fears. In the Spanish conflict these have been so proFranco as to cause their readers to assume that Fascism and the church were together fighting for God and the Roman church, a fight for religion against Communism. At the moment II Duce and the Hierarchy in Rome have a difference, so important that it made the late pope speak out; and the members of the faith must keep in line with the authority in Rome, especially as the Hierarchy is busy courting the democracies in Britain and America. Mussolini follows the lead of the main member of the Berlin-Rome axis: Hitler has determined that if the church is to continue to exist in Germany it may do so only if subordinate to the state, and Mussolini wants the same, but is not in a position to demand it. The cardinal is rather late in the day in trying to keep the distinction between the totalitarian church and that of Fascism, but the flock are obedient, and in due time the Hierarchy in Rome will find the way to get the best of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">bargain with Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Freethinkers—Religious Section</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• Retired dean Inge, one of the lights of the English church who in the newspapers broadcast their unbelief in the Scriptures, has, he says, been assailed as a heretic and dishonest by “one whose orthodoxy is as stiff as a poker, and sometimes as hot”. He does not like the charge, and says, “It is unpleasant to be held as a hypocrite by truculent and furious fanatics.” The dean breaks away from the harsh creeds because he cannot support them. That is to the good; but he takes the same liberty with the Scriptures, and treats them as being no more than the opinions and beliefs of men. He will not accept the records of the miracles of Jesus as historical, nor be bound by the prophetic writings. He will make the Scriptures conform to his philosophy. All the same he wants to be considered as a good churchman, a true upholder and supporter of reli-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">gipn as represented by the Church of England. At the same time he makes a bid for a standing as one of the world’s philosophers. He says, &quot;The old arguments from miracles and prophecies do ’not appeal to us at all,” and he has the effrontery to quote the words of Jesus in his support, as when Jesus said in rebuke to the Jews, “Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.” Says the dean, “We do not want to see signs and wonders, and are beginning to realize that miracles taken as historical records add nothing which is of interest to religion.” Like so many of his cloth, he does not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, nor the record of His ascension ; nor does he believe that Jesus descended into hades [the grave] and was raised from the dead by the power of God. He also says, “We live in an age dominated by natural science,” and to him natural science is as much a revelation of God as the Word of God—evidently it is more so; for he believes in science but not in the Scriptures. The difference between the ordinary freethinker and the religious unbelievers is that one will have nothing to do with the hypocrisy of religion and the other is its ardent supporter. Both the bishop of Birmingham and dean Inge tell of their hope through extension of knowledge of natural science. Both admit they are in the dark concerning the purposes of God. The Scriptures say that God is near to all that call upon Him, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. These gentlemen know these sayings, but they have no faith in them, or they refuse the conditions of discipleship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">• 27ie </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font7"> makes a splash heading of a letter it sent to Mr. Chamberlain, and his reply. Recently Mr. Chamberlain made a request to Franco that he should not allow his army to wreak vengeance on the city of Barcelona and its inhabitants. To the editor this request was a slur on that “great Christian gentleman”, a man who does not make war after such fashion: it could not be other than that the “gentleman” would act as a gentleman should! Mr. Chamberlain suitably replied, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> got something for its pages. But it seems that the memory of the editor ’ was rather short; for last year the pope himself addressed a request to his friend Franco requesting that his army ^should not bomb women and chil-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">dren. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Herald</span><span class="font7"> did not take that chance to get a front-page heading by a letter from the pope. The British Catholic papers persistently minimize the records of Franco’s bombing of fugitives, and have as consistently exaggerated the records of the acts of the government’s forces. The lie factories, and their adjuncts given to the perversion of facts, have been working overtime all the time of this Spanish rebellion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The duke of Atholl, whose wife, the duchess, has been an active friend of republican Spain, makes a statement to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds News</span><span class="font7"> on what he says is absolutely reliable evidence. In the Catalonian retreat, he reports, “The planes of Franco dropped pretty little chocolate boxes and the children ran to pick up what they thought to be much-longed-for sweets. As they opened the boxes the bomb concealed inside went off, burning the hands and the faces, sometimes almost beyond recognition.” Says the duke, “As an old British officer I feel it my duty to make known this example of civilized barbarism as used in modern warfare,”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>Land Values</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• A writer who has knowledge of the situation calls attention to the following facts which he claims reveal a very dangerous situation in which the country would find itself in a time of prolonged war. He calls attention to the fact that the land under cultivation in Britain is not nearly as much in area as in 1914, and that there is no intensive cultivation to bring the land to its full measure., of fertility. With greater risk of cutting off of supplies from overseas, Britain is less able, to produce at home; with two and a half million fewer acres in use, there are now nearly five million more people to feed than in 1913. His figures are; The total area of Great Britain, excluding water, is over 56 million acres. The total area under cultivation in 1913 was 32 million acres; in 1936, 29| million. Allow-, ing an outside figure for towns and village^ and roads, there remains unworked and derelict, used only for grazing ,a few thousand sheep, and employing almost no capital, the appalling figure of 211 million acres. In other words, more than one-third of the whole lies waste, while Britain imports millions of tons of foods which these acres could be made to yield, and which would provide homes and work for thousands who must now queue for. their share of the “dole”. A strong point is made that so much of the land is used for,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sport. It is said that of Scotland’s total area of over 19 million acres no less than 3 j million are used as deer forest, withdrawn, much of it in late years, from cultivation to enable a few rich people to indulge their love of sport. Not only were crofters and others deprived of their livelihood, but the country was denuded of the food these acres would have provided, and its defenses thereby weakened. “It is clear,” this writer says, “that so far as agriculture has given place to game and sport this has been a leading cause of diminishing the welfare of 36 million people. The welfare of the people is sacrificed to the pleasure of a few 'thousand persons.” Here is an instance where democracy needs taking in hand. The few hold it for their destructive sport, and keep the people from that which is their right. But while the government of the country is ’ in the hands of the wealthy and the system under their control there is little probability that a change will be effected.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>Unemployment</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The register of unemployed rose in January to well over the 2,000,000 mark. Evidently the extra work caused by rearmament is not absorbing the out-of-work men and women. This means that trade is poor, and, in fact, the export values of last year were less than in 1929 by £200,000,000. There will be a terrible slump some day. The Yorkshire Agricultural Conference has called the attention of the Government to the farming condition of that county of broad acres—it is, of course, by far the largest of the English counties, having an acreage of 3,723,724 acres. It is said that through lack of policy the Government is allowing the land to deteriorate, and workers to leave the county. There is much less area under cultivation than in the time of the Great War.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Also the shipping and engineering unions call the attention of the Government to the fact that at the present time British shipping firms have vessels to the value off £7,000,000 under construction in foreign yards while there is a marked absence of orders in British yards; and further, that nine-tenths of old ships for breaking up were sold to be broken up outside the British Isles. It is clear that money rules.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>Praying for Peace</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• It appears that Pastor Miiller, of Berlin, the successor of Pastor Niembllcr, has incurred the anger of the German state officials by publicly praying for peace. It was suggested that he should be held to the charge of high treason, which involves the sentence of death, for thus interfering in the affairs of the State. To pray for peace is considered by religionists as an eminently proper thing to do, but the matter assumes a very different aspect to the dictator: why should a pastor set his congregation to pray for peace, when peace is not the policy of the State ? Here is interference with the affairs of State. In any case, Hitler represents the will of God to Germany —so he claims.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The pastor has no warrant in the Scriptures for his action: public prayers of this nature are an assumption of religionists. Jesus said to His disciples, ‘When thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy Father in secret.’ (Matthew 6:6) Religionists have taken altogether too much upon themselves. The true follower of Jesus does not act as they do; he knows that he is not called upon to interfere either publicly or privately in the affairs of the State in which he lives. He has the inviolable right C and the duty to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God, and also to deny the right of the State to interfere with his worship of Jehovah. The late pope, it is reported, died with the word “peace” on his lips, and it is said that the last years of his life were chiefly occupied with the preservation of peace in the earth. For this men commend him—the peoples do not want war. His example is considered by religionists to be a good one to follow, and, in fact, they take upon themselves an obligation to pray for the peace of the world. The true disciples of Jesus, acquainted with the Scriptures, know there comes a time when peace is taken from the earth, when the rider on the red horse goes forth, given power “to take peace from the earth”. (Revelation 6:4) Too, the fact that the time is now come when God arises to shake terribly.the earth is part of the witness to His word and to His name which is now being given by Jehovah’s witnesses. Jesus, the Prince of Peace, foretold the time when He as Michael should stand up and there would be a time of trouble in the earth such as had never been experienced. That time is come, and now there will be no peace on the earth till the final battle has been fought and the enemies of Jehovah and His kingdom are vanquished and destroyed.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>Cesar Abadia Estrellose</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Cesar Abadia Estrellose, Colombian aviator, was brave to the point of recklessness, but he was not obedient. After six months’ suspension for recklessness in flight be was doing stunts over a crowd of 20,000. His instructions were that he must stay up at least 500 feet. He came down to the 200-foot level, his plane struck the aerial of a radio station and in an instant fell to the ground, cutting a path through spectators for more than fifty feet. Estrellose and 36 others were killed, and more than 100 injured; all because he was disobedient.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Communication with Scientists</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ An airplane, searching for an overdue scientific party in the Grand Canyon, located a group nearly a mile below them and dropped three notes. The first read: “If you are the scientific expedition from the - University of Michigan, all persons lie down.” All six did. The second note read: “If everybody O.K., raise your arms to a horizontal position.” All six did. The third note said, “If you need food, everybody sit down.” Nobody sat down. Then the fliers reported to their commanding officer at El Paso that the six explorers needed no help.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>Around the World</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Howard Hughes’ time around the world, 91 hours 10 minutes 8 seconds, was at a rate (208.1 miles an hour) four times as fast as a fast railway train, and seven times as fast as the fastest ocean liner. The record, for seaplanes, is held by Agello. His speed of 441 miles an hour is about half the speed of a revolver bullet and considered fairly near the maximum of practical airplane speed. Speeds of 750 miles an hour in the stratosphere are envisioned, but at present are considered impractical.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>The Flight from Berlin</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The German Condor monoplane flew from the military airport of Staaken, Berlin, to New York in 24 hours 54 minutes and made the return trip in 19 hours 59 minutes. Average speed going was 157 miles per hour; returning, 196.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Y</span><span class="font7">OU will be astounded at the progress that is being made toward that end, when you read Judge Rutherford’s new booklet FASCISM OR FREEDOM. “Fascism w’ill never come here,” say many people in America; but are they aware of what is going On behind the scenes, things whieh the newspapers know but won’t publish ? A foreign power, operating under a religious cloak, has its men in key positions in the government, to further its aims. It controls the police, the courts and the newspapers to such an extent that the majority of the people are kept in ignorance and their liberties are being rapidly taken away. Men and women who dare to tell the truth are persecuted, imprisoned, threatened, and their peaceable assemblies broken up.</span></p>

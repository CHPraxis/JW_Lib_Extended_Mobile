<p><span class="font9">117 Adams Street » &nbsp;&nbsp;« Brooklyn, N.Y., U. S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFICERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J. F. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">President</span><span class="font9"> W.

<p><span class="font8">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Oflicer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Ofiieer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ITS MISSION</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“WAR OF VINDICATION” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">December marks the “War of Vindication” Testimony Period. Like the daily march around Jericho over a complete period, the testimony for Jehovah’s name and against the foes of Theocracy continues despite the season of the year. All Theocratic publishers should offer to the public first a three-booklet combination on a 10c contribution, including </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font8"> if available. If this offer is not accepted, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font8"> will be offered on a 5e contribution, or any contribution possible to the obtainer. This will insure a wide distribution of this most timely booklet. Portable phonographs are not to be left in idleness, but should be used from house to house to run the latest recording, and the publications announced thereon will then be offered to the listeners. The war is on, and you will now do your part therein, reporting at the end of the month’s campaign the effectiveness of your intensive activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YEARBOOK FOR 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 1940 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font8"> presents a comprehensive report of the past year’s world-wide activities of these publishers of Jehovah’s Theocracy by Christ. You will marvel at the most interesting and most successful service year yet, even with opposition increasing, nations being swallowed up by dicta tors, and wartime restrictions being generally applied, curtailing the Theocratic work in many countries. This report is prepared by the president of the Society. Additionally, there is a brief comment by the president on the text for the new calendar year, together with a text for each day of the year accompanied by an appropriate comment thereon as taken from recent issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font8"> The edition of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> is limited, and hence the regular contribution of 50e a copy is taken therefor Order promptly, with remittance to cover. Each company will place their orders with the local company servant, that he may convenience this office by sending in a combination order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1940 CALENDAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 1940 Calendar sets out the text for the new calendar year, to wit: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” (Psalm 13:5) A beautiful color illustration, specially painted, harmonizes with the theme of the text, and its portrayal of what is impending will gladden your heart. Neat calendar pads indicate the special Testimony Periods of the year and the special lines of endeavor of the other months of activity in publishing the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE THEOCRACY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?”—Ps. 24:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TEHOVAH is the Almighty Theocrat. Christ Jesus I is the King, whom Jehovah has enthroned and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font10"> sent forth to rule. “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) “To Jehovah belong-eth the earth and the fulness thereof, the world and they who dwell therein.” (Ps. 24:1, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font10"> To his mighty King, Christ Jesus, whom he has enthroned, Jehovah addresses these words: “Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.” (Ps. 2:8, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font10"> Christ Jesus has asked, in obedience to the command of his Father, and he is now the rightful Euler of the world, hence the Governor and Executive Officer acting for the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’ The Theocracy, therefore, is Jehovah’s government of the world by Christ Jesus, the righteous Overlord. “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) The princes shall exercise authority in exact harmony with and according to the decision of the King, Christ Jesus. Such is the government, or great kingdom, concerning which Jesus directed his disciples to pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”—Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The organization of The Theocracy, as disclosed by the Scriptures, is this: The Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” the Supreme One, is the Creator and Builder and Organizer; his only begotten and beloved Son, who is Christ Jesus, is Executive Officer of Jehovah God, whom God makes the King of the world; and associated with Christ Jesus by the grace and selection of Jehovah are 144,000 taken from amongst men, who prove faithful and are made “priests of God and of Christ”, and who “reign with him”. (Rev. 1:6; Rev. 20:4,6) There is “one God and Father of all, who is above all”. (Eph. 4:6) There is one Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus, the “mediator between God and men” (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6), whom God hath made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36); and one body, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (Eph. 1: 22; 4:15) Such is a brief description of the capital organization of Jehovah God, and which in symbol is called Zion. (Ps. 132:13) “The Lord [Jehovah] hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. I will also clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.” (Ps. 132:13-16) “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.”—Ps. 102:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VISIBLE REPRESENTATIVES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* The official or capital organization called “Zion” is not visible to human eyes. It is the new heaven of righteousness. The Scriptures further disclose that The Theocracy will have visible representatives on the earth, who shall perform the duties of governors under the direction and supervision of the theocratic King. Such men were in times of old called “fathers” in Israel. They proved their faithfulness unto Jehovah God and shall be made the children of The Christ and his representatives on the earth. This organization is described by the apostle Peter as the “new heavens and [the] new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The 144,000 body members of Christ are designated the “little flock” and share with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. (Luke 12:32; 22: 28-30) The visible representatives of the theocratic King are designated “princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16) The term “prince”, as used in this text, means governor, ruler or steward.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The Scriptures disclose another class of persons, whom the Lord gathers unto himself and who receive life everlasting and live on the earth, and which company collectively is called his “other sheep” and the “great multitude”. (John 10:16; Rev. 7:9-15) Those “other sheep” are brought under the full supervision and control of the Lord Jesus Christ, the theocratic King, and under his direction they carry out the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> It is a vital necessity that persons who desire to live shall learn of Jehovah’s purpose, particularly with reference to his Theocratic Government. His purpose God makes known through his Word, the Bible, and the reason for this Watchtower publication is to aid those who are of good will toward God to learn of his purpose and of his gracious provision for obedient men. Jehovah God created the earth for man, and he made man to inhabit the earth. “I have made the earth, and created man upon it; I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; I am the Lord, and there is none else.”— Isa. 45:12,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The earth shall be inhabited by men; that is to say, human creatures shall live on the earth forever, and never die, being obedient to the Theocratic Government. Not many persons now on the earth believe the good news concerning The Theocracy, but those truths are made clear and certain by the Lord himself. By his unchangeable Word he makes this declaration : “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. 46:11) ‘My word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that whereunto I have sent it.’ (Isa. 55:11) Those who will constitute the “other sheep” of the Lord, and who will form the great multitude, must now inform themselves concerning Jehovah’s purpose and must rely wholly upon his Word. It is therefore essential to receive his instruction, as set forth in his Word, and to be diligent in the study of that Word, together with the helps that God has provided for the understanding of the same at this time. Jehovah God is “the Fountain of life”; “salvation belongeth unto the Lord.” (Ps. 36:9; 3:8) All who live must please God, and therefore must believe that God exists, and that he is the rewarder of those who diligently seek him. (Heb. 11:6) They must know that Christ Jesus is the Redeemer of faithful men and that God has provided that life shall be given to obedient men through Christ Jesus, and that there is no other name given whereby men may be saved and receive life. (Acts 4:12; Rom. 6: 23) Those who are of good will must now fortify themselves by reading these Bible texts and carefully considering them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ God created man a perfect creature and made his life dependent upon complete obedience to God’s law. The Devil induced that man to rebel against God, and his disobedience brought sin into the world. Thus disobedience brought death upon men. All the offspring of that man have been born in sin, which means that they have no right to life. (Rom. 5:12; Ps. 51:5) The Devil then rebelliously and wickedly declared before God that he could cause all men to disobey God and curse Him, and thus he challenged God to put men on the earth who would remain faithful to Jehovah. (Job 2:5) That wicked challenge raised the question of who is supreme, Jehovah God or the Devil? God could immediately have destroyed the Devil and thus proved his own supremacy, but it pleased him to give the Devil full opportunity to prove his wicked challenge, and, he failing to do so, all creation must see and admit the supremacy of Jehovah God, and learn that life everlasting can be had only by full obedience to God’s law. Jehovah then said to the Devil: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font10"> Since that declaration centuries have passed and the Devil has had full opportunity to make good his wicked challenge. He has failed, and his end is come, and that he knows. —Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PROMISE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> God gave his Word that he would raise up a “seed” that would crush the Devil in due time. (Gen. 3:15) God then made prophetic pictures foretelling his purpose, and he used Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and others to make such prophetic pictures. To Abraham he said: “Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 12: 3; 22:10-18) In the picture made and recorded in the last above cited text Abraham offered his son Isaac in sacrifice. There Abraham pictured Jehovah God and Isaac pictured Christ Jesus, who is the real seed of promise. That picture foretold that God would permit his beloved Son, whom Isaac foreshadowed, to be offered as a sacrifice.—Gal. 3:16, 26-29; 4: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Jacob, who is also called “Israel”, was a grandson of Abraham, and Jacob was also used by Jehovah to make prophetic pictures relating to the Theocratic Government. Jacob pictured The Christ, that is to say, Jesus Christ, the Head, and the members of “his body”. (Eph. 5:23, 30) This prophecy is recorded in the Bible, to wit: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre [symbol of ruler] shall rise out of Israel. . . . Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.”—Num. 24:17,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Judah was the son of Jacob, and concerning whom this prophecy was written, to wit: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.” (Gen. 49:10, A.jR.7.) That prophecy foretold Christ Jesus, the Messiah, the King of the world, the Theocrat’s great Executive Officer. Jesus Christ is “the Lion of the tribe of Juda” and “the Bright and Morning Star”. (Rev. 5:5; 22:16) Thus God used Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to make prophetic pictures fore-teHing the coming of Christ his King and the One who should be the active Ruler of the great Theocratic Government. (For a more detailed consideration of this matter see the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font10"> pages 88-130.) That it is the purpose of Jehovah God, by his King, to destroy the Devil and all of his works and organization is abundantly shown by the Scriptures. “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8; Heb. 2:14; Ps. 110:2-5) The triumph of the Theocratic Government will be a complete vindication of Jehovah’s name and his Word. Christ Jesus the King is the Vindicator of Jehovah and the One who executes Jehovah’s purpose. From Abel to John the Baptist there were men who had faith in God’s promise that he would set up his Theocratic Government, and their hopes rested in that promised government. Because of their faith they received God’s approval, and in his due time they shall be fully rewarded.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVELOPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A long period of time elapsed from the rebellion in Eden till the coming of Jesus. The conception of the child Jesus was not by the power of man, but by the power of the spirit of Almighty God. (Matt. 1:20-25) Jesus was therefore born holy, pure, harmless, undefiled, and without sin, and which meant that he was entitled to live. (Heb. 7: 26) God caused Jesus to be born as a man of flesh and blood that he might be the Redeemer of man and the King of the Theocratic Government. Jesus thus declared: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world.” (John 18: 36, 37) The birth of the child Jesus was announced by the angel of Almighty God. (Luke 2:10,11) Thirty years after the birth of Jesus Jehovah God “anointed” him, which means that he commissioned him to carry out the purpose for which he had been sent. (Matt. 3:16,17; Acts 10: 38) Immediately thereafter Jesus Christ entered upon the work which he was commissioned to do, and he began his testimony by making known that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. (Matt. 4:17) He was then the anointed King of the Theocratic Government, and, he being then present in the earth, it was literally true that the kingdom was at hand. From that moment onward the development of the kingdom progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ENEMY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> Satan the Devil is the adversary of God and the enemy of man. From the very time of the anointing of Jesus Satan began his work of opposition in his effort to destroy Christ Jesus. He laid before Jesus that which would have resulted in His destruction had Jesus yielded thereto. Satan failed, Jesus emphatically declaring that those who live shall worship Jehovah God, and him only. (Matt. 4:1-11) Then the Devil employed every possible means to oppose Jesus and his work, and the chief instrument used by the Devil was religious leaders and the practitioners of religion, particularly called “Pharisees”, or clergy of that time. God had warned the Israelites that religion was a snare of the Devil, but the Israelites failed to give heed to that warning and, being led by and fearing men, they fell into the Devil’s snare. (Deut. 7:25; Ps. 106:36) The religious leaders called “Pharisees” having yielded to the Devil’s influence, they fell into the Devil’s snare and made the Word of God of none effect by teaching and practicing religion. (Matt. 15:1-9) Jesus informed those religionists that they were the instruments of the Devil, and they being blind, they were leading the blind people and turning them away from God and from his Word. (John 8:42-44; Matt. 15:14) The Devil continuously used the religious leaders and persecuted Christ Jesus, and at the end of three and one-half years that opposition succeeded by having Jesus arrested and convicted, upon false testimony, of the crime of treason; and Jesus was executed by being nailed to the tree, as if he was an accursed sinner. Then the Devil used those same religious leaders to bribe men to give testimony that the body of Jesus had been stolen from the tomb, and this they did in order to keep the people in ignorance of his resurrection. (Matt. 27:62-66; 28:12-15) The Devil thought his religious clergymen had done well and that he had defeated God’s purpose. Again the Devil had failed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1S</sup> Jesus being a perfect man and anointed to be King, why should he suffer ? He proved that man can endure the greatest suffering and at the same time remain faithful to God. Thereby he completely refuted Satan’s wicked challenge to Jehovah. Because of his full obedience under the most adverse conditions he proved his full perfection in harmony with Jehovah: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. 5: 8, 9) He demonstrated the fact that all who receive God’s approval must be faithful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Why should Jesus die? He did not die because of any wrong on his part. The manner of his death was as that of a sinner, but yet he was without sin, holy and harmless. He proved that man can be true and faithfully obedient to God even unto death. Because of Jesus’ faithful obedience God raised him out of death and exalted him to the highest position next to Jehovah in the Theocratic Government: “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—Phil. 2: 8-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">” The lifeblood of Jesus, the perfect man, poured out in death provided the purchase price for men who are sinners by inheritance and who by faith accept him as the Savior. Jesus is therefore the Redeemer, Purchaser, and Deliverer of those who believe on him and obey God’s law. (John 3:16) Adam’s sin brought death upon all mankind. The obedience of Jesus unto death opened the way for men to get life and to receive it as a free gift: “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that be-lieveth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abide th on him.”—John 3: 35, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> He died as a man. Jesus was resurrected to life a spirit with full power and authority to give life to all who believe and obey. “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit.” (1 Pet. 3:18) “Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” (Rom. 5:18,19; 6: 23) He “was dead”, but now he is “alive for evermore” and is the world’s rightful King. (Rev. 1:18) As the Purchaser and Redeemer of man Jesus Christ is clothed with power and authority to give life to those who believe on and obey him. “And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”—Heb. 5: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ENTHRONED</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> Jesus was raised to life “a life-giving spirit” and exalted to heaven more than nineteen centuries ago. (1 Cor. 15:45, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font10"> Did he begin the reign as King immediately after his exaltation? No; for the reason that such was not Jehovah’s due time for him to reign. When Jesus ascended on high Jehovah said to him, as it is written: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1) Concerning this it is written: “But this priest, having offered one sacrifice for sins evermore, sat down on the right hand of God: as for the rest waiting until his foes be made his footstool.”—Ileb. 10:12,13, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>80</sup> It was in the year 1914 that the period of waiting mentioned in the foregoing text came to an end, and God then placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and sent him forth to rule. (Ps. 110:2) “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) “Thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” (Rev. 11:17,18) The fulfillment of this prophecy came in the autumn season of 1914, and this is further corroborated by the prophetic words of Jesus and the facts coming to pass in fulfillment of his prophecy.—Matt. 24: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>81</sup> From the resurrection of Jesus until his enthronement as King Jehovah God continued to prepare and develop his royal organization. This the Lord has done by causing his purpose to be declared as written in his Word, that those who have heard and believed on the Lord Christ Jesus as Redeemer and King, and who have then fully devoted themselves unto God and Christ, have been given an opportunity to prove their faithful obedience unto God. The apostles and other faithful men did obey unto death and had the promise of partaking with Christ Jesus in his resurrection and in his kingdom. For that reason they must wait the second coming of Christ and his enthronement as King and the building up of Jehovah’s capital organization. Concerning this the apostle said immediately preceding his death: “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, 1 have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”—2 Tim. 4: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>28</sup> It is to the faithful apostles and others of like faithfulness that the promise is given that they shall have part with Christ Jesus in the kingdom or Theocratic Government. (Luke 22:28-30) To such Jesus addresses these words: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”—Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>23</sup> These faithful ones are the “little flock”, taken out from amongst men to be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God. (Acts 15:14) Such are the witnesses for Jehovah. Such faithful ones constitute the spiritual temple of God, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:16) It was in the year 1918, that is, three and one-half years after his enthronement, that Christ Jesus came straightway to the temple of Jehovah. (Mal. 3:1-3) That was the time for the resurrection of the faithful apostles and other like faithful men who died after them, and concerning which the apostle testified at 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17. These being resurrected were brought into Zion, God’s capital organization. Then Jesus caused the consecrated ones on earth to be submitted to a fiery trial or test, as set forth in Malachi 3:1-4. The approved ones were builded up into Zion, the temple, in order that they might offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness by becoming his faithful witnesses. Collectively that approved number the Lord designated as the “faithful and wise servant”, to whom he committed his kingdom interests on the earth. (Matt. 24:45-47) All of such must from that time forward prove their faithfulness and meet the divine requirements if they would be forever in the royal organization of the great Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>u</sup> Who of the consecrated shall be made part of the Theocratic Government? David, the prophet and king of Israel, pictured Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, and in answer to the foregoing question uttered this prophecy: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?” (Ps. 24:3) According to another translator the text reads: “Who shall ascend the mountain of Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy place?” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font10"> This question propounded clearly indicates that some might enter the temple, being approved, and thereafter might not stand or remain in the temple, by reason of their failure to meet the requirements. It is written that every one in the temple must show forth the praises of Jehovah.— Ps. 29:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>25</sup> They must show their praise of him by faithfully being his witnesses and faithfully obeying the commandments of the Lord. (Heb. 13:15) The Lord Jesus makes known concerning those who become offended and are lawless that he sends forth his angels to gather them out of the kingdom, that is, to remove them from the temple: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.”—Matt. 13:41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>26</sup> The spirit-begotten ones on earth at the temple judgment who enter therein because of the Lord's approval constitute the remnant of the temple company, all of whom must be witnesses for Jehovah. (Isa. 43:10-12) Every one of such must declare God’s name in the earth before Armageddon. (Ex. 9:16) To all such the command is given to ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom to all the world as a witness’. (Matt. 24:14) The remnant therefore constitute the “feet of him”, that is, the last members of the body of Christ on earth, who by reason of being the witnesses for Jehovah bring good news to those who have the hearing ear. (Isa. 52:7) Those who are gathered into the temple and who then fail or refuse to obey the commandments of the Lord cannot remain in the temple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>27</sup> The question is then propounded: “Who shall stand in his holy place?” That means, Who shall remain in the capital organization of Jehovah? The Lord causes the answer to be recorded: “He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.”—Ps. 24:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>28</sup> Those who are brought into the “holy place”, that is, the temple, must devote their faculties to right and righteousness in obedience to God’s law and must refrain from touching or having anything to do with the Devil’s organization, which is unclean. The “heart” is the seat of unselfishness, or love, and therefore those of the remnant must be unselfishly devoted to the great Theocrat and his King. Such must not desire or seek vain things. That means that they must shun religion, which is the snare of the Devil and which is a defamation of God’s name. If they would stand or remain in the “holy place” they must not fear man; they must not desire the approval of men or fear that they might not receive man’s approval. They must fear God and be diligent at all times to seek his approval. They having made a covenant to do the will of God, that covenant must be faithfully kept and performed, and to break that covenant willingly means that such person has sworn deceitfully and hence could not remain in the “holy place”. That covenant with Jehovah requires the creature to avoid religion and to proclaim only the truth. The remnant must be not only willing but joyful witnesses of the Lord, giving full devotion to the Theocratic Government. Claiming to serve God and at the same time co-operating with or attempting to co-operate with religion or religious organizations means the breaking of the covenant with Jehovah. To stand in the holy place one must be fully and completely devoted to The Theocrat and his government. The test that has come upon the remnant of the temple during the past few years has demonstrated that some have failed to meet the requirements and have been gathered out and made a part of the “evil servant” class, the “son of perdition”.— Matt. 24: 48-51; 2 Thess. 2: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>29</sup> The Theocracy is a government of peace. The King is the Ruler of Peace, and everyone of his official organization must be at peace with God and his King and at peace with every member of the royal house. Concerning the Theocrat and his King it is written prophetically, referring to his birth and to his reign: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall he called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isa. 9:6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>40</sup> There shall be no controversy, and there shall be no end of peace in the Theocratic Government. That peace and harmony must prevail with the remnant of the temple company. Let everyone who hopes to remain in the Theocratic Government bear this in mind: that peace must at all times exist between those who are of the remnant. Each one who is in the temple is the servant of God, and all of the remnant collectively constitute that one body designated the “faithful and wise servant”, to whom are committed the kingdom interests on earth at the present time. It is plainly written that God hath placed the members in the body according to his good pleasure. (1 Cor. 12:18) No one in the temple can willingly withdraw from God’s organization and the service thereof and offer as an excuse for such that he is offended at another person who is of God’s organization. God judges his own servants. “Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.”—Rom. 14:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>81</sup> God has placed upon certain ones of his organization the duty of seeing that organization instructions are carried out. It may become necessary and hence proper for such a one, by reason of his position in the Society, that is, of the remnant of God’s organization, to rebuke another who is going contrary to organization instructions; but such rebuke is no excuse or justification for offense or withdrawal from the Lord’s service.—1 Tim. 5: 20; Titus 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>82</sup> He having gathered his people into the temple, all the temple company have come to the full and complete unity in Christ. (Eph. 4:13-15) That means that all must be at peace with one another and continue in peace amongst themselves. If it appears that some are bent upon disturbing the peace of the earthly members of the temple company, such is strong evidence that the disturber is not of the temple and that such person should be avoided. (Rom. 16:17,18) All members of the temple, fully united in love, must stand firmly together. “Stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together [unitedly] for the faith of the gospel.” (Phil. 1: 27) Let all companies of the people of God see to it that complete unity, peace and harmony exist among them and that they are all united fully in supporting the Theocracy. All who 'stand in the holy place’ must be wholly and completely faithful to the Theocratic government. There can be no middle ground, and there can be no compromise. All the temple class are united, all being anointed with the spirit of the Lord; and the Lord voices his pleasure in them when he thus through his prophet addressed to them these words: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!”—Ps. 133:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>88</sup> There is neither excuse nor justification for any of the remnant to be at enmity with their brethren, and none who are will receive the Lord’s final approval.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>84</sup> Mount Zion is builded up, and Jehovah has there appeared in his glory. (Ps. 102:16) He there appears representatively by his King, Christ Jesus, and hence it is the place of dwelling and action of Jehovah in carrying forward his government. (Ps. 132:13-18) The Scriptures written concerning Jehovah’s organization now apply: “Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not; lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” (Isa. 54:2,3, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font10"> “But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.” (Obadiah 17) “But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him.”—Hab. 2:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“OTHER SHEEP”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>88</sup> The King, Christ Jesus, says: “And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:16) These are they that shall make up the “great multitude”. They are now being gathered by the King, and those who come seeking the way to life by faith in Christ Jesus are given refuge and protection under the organization of Jehovah. The means employed by the Lord to gather his “other sheep” is by sending forth his witnesses to proclaim within the hearing of the people the message of Jehovah of and concerning the Theocracy. (Matt. 24:14) Christ Jesus and the members of the temple make known that the King has come and that it is the Theocracy that provides salvation to those who obey. “And saviours shall come up on mount Zion.” (Obad. 21) Hearing the glad tidings concerning the Theocracy, the “other sheep” of the Lord come from all nations, kindreds and tongues, seeking the way to life. (Rev. 7: 9) This the people of good will are doing at the present time, and those who thus come are told that they must seek righteousness and meekness and, so doing, they may be hid and find complete protection in the great disaster that shall shortly fall upon the world over which Satan has long been the invisible ruler.— Zeph. 2:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE EMPHASIZED</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">** Again peace is emphasized. This does not mean that peace shall come to every person, but that it will be given to those who are of good will toward the Theocratic Government. At the birth of Jesus, Jehovah’s messenger announced: “Glory in the highest, unto God! and on earth peace, among men of goodwill.” (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font10"> That declaration from heaven limits “peace on earth” to those who are of good will toward Jehovah and his government by Christ Jesus. To be of good will means to fully support the Theocracy upon learning of the same. The facts show that at the present time those of good will who learn of the Theocratic Government joyfully and enthusiastically support the same, giving their devotion to God and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">” The religious systems have hoodwinked and deceived many persons. This is particularly true with reference to the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical systems, ruled arbitrarily by the Hierarchy. Many honest and sincere persons who are held in the Roman Catholic organization desire righteousness, and these must hear the truth; and, hearing and obeying the message of the Lord, they come seeking the way to Zion, God’s capital organization, and they come with gladness of heart. Learning the truth, they lift up their hearts and voices with songs of praise to the Most High. (Isa. 35:10) Those who thus seek the Theocratic Government are not limited to any earthly organization, but the sincere ones seeking the truth come from all peoples and walks of life. Learning of the Theocracy, that multitude of persons of good will stand before the throne of the King, engaging in the praise of Jehovah and his Vindicator. They learn that salvation belongs to Jehovah, and not to men or any man-made organization. Therefore they sing: “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:10) At once they see their privilege of full devotion to the Theocracy, and, seeing it, they devote themselves to the service thereof at all times thereafter. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:15-17) They become the joyful and obedient witnesses to the name and kingdom of the Most High, and hence they join with the remnant and bear testimony thereof to the people.-Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">” Note now the peace and harmony that must exist and persist among all of God’s organization, and those who have found protection under the Theocratic Government. The remnant of the temple say: “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem.”—Ps. 122:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">” “Jerusalem” in symbol stands for Jehovah’s organization in general, meaning all of the capital organization and those who find protection under it and who will form the great multitude. “Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.&quot; (Ps. 122:3) Zion is the capital organization over the entire organization of the Lord. “For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.” (Ps. 122: 5) David mentioned in this verse is the Greater David, the beloved Son, Christ Jesus: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee.” (Ps. 122: 6) This command is given to all who have been gathered unto the Lord, and all are told that peace must be within “thy walls”: “Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.” (Vs. 7) Thus it appears that both the remnant and the Jonathan class, who will compose the “great multitude”, are companions, and they must work harmoniously together: “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good.” (Vss. 8,9) There must be complete unity and peace amongst all thus gathered un • to the King. The remnant and the Jonathan class will have their hearts closely knit together in love and firmly support and aid one another. Jehovah used David and Jonathan to make a beautiful picture of this unity: “And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.” “Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.” (1 Sam. 18:1,3,4) All those of the remnant and of the Jonathan class vdll appreciate that now their greatest privilege is to fully and wholly give their support to the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>40</sup> Every government of earth is now against the Theocracy. There is not one that is for the Theocracy. The King of the Theocratic Government says: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.&quot; (Matt. 12:30) The facts now well known fully prove that all the political, commercial and religious organizations are against the kingdom of God. The reason is, because Satan, the invisible “god of this world”, and all his power, and the power of his agents, are against the Theocratic Government. (2 Cor. 4:4;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">John 14: 30) Prompted by the Devil and at the immediate instance of the religious system the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the political, commercial and religious elements of the world have conspired together against the Theocracy, to destroy those who serve that righteous government. Concerning this God prophetically foretold: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (Ps. 2: 2, 3) “They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.” (Ps. 83: 3) All the nations practice some kind of religion, and all the nations have forgotten God, and none of them call upon his kingdom and look to it as the means of salvation and deliverance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>41</sup> The end of Satan’s operation is at hand, and, knowing that his time is short, Satan has brought great woes upon the peoples of the earth. (Rev. 12:12) Fear has gained control of the political and commercial elements, and these have invoked religion to bring them aid. Upon earth there is “distress of nations”, “men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” (Luke 21: 25, 26) All the forces of the world under Satan’s command are gathered together for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Rev. 16:13-16) All of Satan’s forces are against The Theocracy and those who stand for The Theocracy. Jehovah’s time has come to show his power against all that oppose his government. (Ex. 9:16) It is Jehovah’s time when he, by his right hand, Christ Jesus, 'should destroy them which destroy the earth.’ (Rev. 11:18) That means everything that is against The Theocracy. Agreeable to his expressed purpose, Jehovah has given to Christ his King the nations for an inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for possession. (Ps. 2:8) And what shall the Lord do with all the nations that are against The Theocracy? He answers; “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Ps. 2:9) Such disaster will befall the nations at Armageddon. Only those who fear God and serve his government will survive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTRAST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">** Standing over against the institutions of this wicked world is the glorious kingdom of Jehovah. His government is that of everlasting peace, joy and life. Those who have been taken into the temple, together with their companions who trust fully in and serve the great Theocracy, now can joyfully and truly say: “I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.” (Ps. 4:8) There are no other people on earth who can truly utter these words of the psalmist. Those who know not God are in great fear and trepidation, but those who trust wholly in the great Theocrat and his King can rest in peace.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>43</sup> The remnant and the Jonathan class, their “companions”, love the great Theocrat and his. King. To them Jehovah now graciously gives a vision of his glorious government. It is the kingdom for which faithful men from the time of Abel till now have hoped and prayed. Those faithful men of old include all the faithful prophets, and by faith they beheld the coming of Jehovah’s government and they fully served God, remaining faithful even unto death. “Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city [a lasting-habitation ; a dwelling place in peace].” (Heb. 11:16) Soon those faithful men will be resurrected from death, made perfect, and exalted to the place of the visible governors in the earth. The righteous King shall be over them, and those men shall act in exact harmony with his decisions. Over them all is the Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” and that government shall be a righteous one. (Isa. 32:1) That government will bring peace to the people, and there the righteous shall flourish. (Ps. 72: 7, 8) Many of the nations of earth are now at war, and all nations are in fear and trepidation; but following Armageddon the Theocratic Government will establish everlasting peace on the earth. Of the mighty King of the Theocracy it is written: “And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isa. 2:4) The King at Jehovah’s direc tion will give life everlasting to all who obey. (Roni. 6:23) There will be no more tears shed, because The Theocracy gives to the people everlasting joy. (Rev. 21:1-4) The great multitude under the immediate command and direction of the theocratic King will fulfill the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth” with a people of righteousness. Truly then the earth will be inhabited in fulfillment of God's purpose, inhabited by human creatures whose peace and joy will know no end. Every creature that survives and lives shall sing the praises of Jehovah and his King. By faith the Lord permits his people now to see these good things near at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>44</sup> It is now the privilege of everyone who has a vision of the Theocracy to give his entire service to the Kingdom and devote every faculty that he possesses to that service, and such is his reasonable duty. Today those who have a vision of the Kingdom and an appreciation thereof and who continue with such appreciation can never withdraw from the service of the Theocratic organization. Having once been privileged to enter into the service of the Kingdom and then willingly withdrawing therefrom means the certain and complete end of that person: “For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.”—2 Pet. 2: 21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>45</sup> Complete faithfulness to the Theocracy is required of everyone who enters the kingdom. All must be faithful even unto death. The faithful men of old who shall be made princes exhibited that same degree of faith and faithfulness. Those who will form the “great multitude” must have and exhibit a like degree of faith and faithfulness, even unto death if such be required.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>48</sup> While darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people, and while strife and wickedness rule today amongst men, all persons of good will are invited to give their allegiance and devotion to the Theocrat and his King. Such is the only hope of mankind, as Jehovah has plainly proclaimed to the world. (Matt. 12:18-21) No one can pin his hope to anything the nations of the present -wicked world offer. He that devotes himself to the full and unselfish service of the Theocratic Government shall live. None other shall live. Let all who have a desire for life and all who hate wickedness and love righteousness give heed to the words of the Lord. The earth is his, and the fullness thereof, and he alone can give salvation to life. Zion is builded up, the Theocratic Government is functioning. All people of good will must now seek the Lord and his kingdom and give their unstinted and uncompromising support thereto. Therefore it is written in the prophecy: “This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, 0 Jacob. Selah.” (Ps. 24:6) To all who love righteousness and whose faces are turned toward the great Theocratic Government God through his prophet says: “Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory ? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory ? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.”—Ps. 24: 7-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>47</sup> Jehovah is the King of Eternity. He has enthroned Christ Jesus, his King of the Theocratic Government. Jehovah has appeared in his glory, and the day of deliverance is at hand for all those who flee to the Theocratic Government and give their allegiance and unselfish devotion to the Theocracy. Because of the limited space only a brief outline can here be given of the Theocratic Government. The books </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, Government,</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font10"> give a more detailed description thereof. By pursuing those studies together with the Bible, which God has provided for those who love righteousness, one may learn the truth and know Jehovah and his King: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark15"></a>FOUR ANGELS LOOSED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">TEHOVAH by Christ Jesus revealed to the apostle John I a vision of seven angels with trumpets. Each angel </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8"> sounded his trumpet in turn, which sounding was followed by interesting events, which the vision describes symbolically. When the sixth angel sounded John heard the voice of Christ Jesus command the angel: “Loose the four angels which are bound in [at] the great river Euphrates.” The “four angels” or commissioned messengers of the Lord are all of Jehovah’s witnesses anointed and commissioned and commanded by him to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth. (The term “angels” literally means “messengers”, and does not always apply to creatures having a spirit organism.) During the World War period these messengers had been held in prison or restraint by Satan’s organization, which is symbolically called “Babylon”, and which was foreshadowed by ancient Babylon built on both banks of the river Euphrates. In July, 1927, Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in international convention at Toronto, Canada, and sent forth the proclamation “To the Peoples of Christendom”, which proclamation was supported by the speech “Freedom for the Peoples”, delivered to a visible audience of 15,000 and at the same time broadcast over a network of radio stations, 53 in number, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Both speech and proclamation were issued shortly thereafter in a publication under the title </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples;</span><span class="font8"> and fifty million copies thereof were distributed throughout “Christendom”. The following quotation from the speech, which was delivered July 24, 1927, seems here appropriate, and its agreement with the command given to the sixth angel may be noted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The people desire peace, freedom, prosperity, life and happiness. All thinking persons must now see these can come only from God’s kingdom through Christ. They can never be realized by or through the false system called ‘organized Christianity’. The hypocritical and evil course of ‘Christendom’ is an insult to God and to Christ. It is the deceiver and oppressor of the people. It is completely under the control of Satan the Devil. It depends for its support and maintenance upon the multitudes of peoples, while at the same time it continues to defraud and oppress the people. Let the multitudes of peoples completely and entirely withdraw all support morally, financially, and otherwise from ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’, so called. Let them give their hearts’ devotion and allegiance entirely to God and to Christ, the Prince of Peace, who is now earth’s rightful King. Let them dwell together in peace, and do good to each other, and be ready to receive the blessings which God has in reservation for those who love and obey him. The day of complete freedom is at hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The peoples should therefore for ever abandon and forsake ‘organized Christianity’ called ‘Christendom’ and turn their hearts and minds and their allegiance wholly to God and his Christ for the following reasons, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">“(1) Because ‘Christendom’ is the Devil’s organization operated by him to keep the people in subjection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">“(2) Because it is an instrument of oppression which has been used to make the burdens of men grievous to be borne.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;(3) Because it is false, hypocritical, and wicked, and against the interests of the multitudes of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">“(4) Because it holds out absolutely no hope for the betterment of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">“(5) Because God’s time has come when that evil and hypocritical system shall be destroyed in the greatest time of trouble the world has ever known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">“(6) Because God commands all the peoples who love him to flee from that unrighteous system of so-called ‘organized Christianity’ and thereby escape the dire calamities that shortly shall befall her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">“(7) Because God has set his anointed King, Christ Jesus the Messiah, upon his throne, and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and obey him; and those who so do shall receive and for ever enjoy the blessings of complete freedom, everlasting peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Referring now to the prophetic picture of Revelation 9:13,14 concerning the ones bound at the Euphrates: The ancient city of Babylon was located on the river Euphrates and controlled the traffic and commerce of that river. It was the main part of the ‘waters of Babylon’. (Ps. 137:1,3) God’s prophet long ago foretold how spiritual Israelites, the messengers of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, would be carried away captive, to the river Euphrates, symbolically speaking. (Jer. 13:1-11) The “great river” was where the prisoners were bound, the river therefore picturing the multitudes of people under the control and dominion of Satan’s organization. As stated at Revelation 17:15: “And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore [Babylon, Satan’s woman or organization] sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Revelation 9:15 (A.R.P.) declares that, in obedience to the command, “the four angels were loosed . . . that they should kill the third part of men.” Note that, according to Revelation 16:19, Satan’s organization is “divided into three parts”, to wit: commercial, political and religious; therefore the expression “the third part of men” would not mean one third of Satan’s organization, but would symbolize the three-divisioned official element of Babylon. It is therefore seen now that the Lord through his angel directed the preparation of the contents of the above-mentioned booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font8"> which dealt with all three of the elements of Satan’s organization, to wit, high finance, statesmen and the clergy. God’s message of truth, like fire and brimstone, “shocked the religious susceptibilities” of the chief moguls of “Christendom”; and their mouthpieces, the public press and magazines, re-echoed their many howls. So badly was the National Broadcasting Company, which freely co-operated in the broadcasting of the Resolution and supporting speech, burned and scorched by the turning loose of that message of truth that thereafter its radio facilities cannot be used to broadcast the message of God’s kingdom. Then the ‘waters of the great Euphrates’ began to dry up, as foretold at Revelation 16:12-16, because the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, had turned them away to prepare “the way of the kings of the east”. This drying up of the river Euphrates follows the loosening of the four angels, which had been bound, and it seems clearly to signify that other bound ones aside from Jehovah’s witnesses would be released and would march joyfully to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prior to the time of the Toronto convention of 1927 many of the consecrated ones were still “bound” in fear, and thus their service to the Lord was hindered. Thereafter Jehovah’s witnesses became bolder and fearless. The witness work moved forward with greater unity and increased zeal. At that Toronto convention an address was delivered on the subject “The Mission of a Christian”, and therein the great importance of the house-to-house preaching of the gospel of the kingdom was stressed. It was at that convention that the so-called “Pilgrim Service”, of traveling lecturers, was superseded by field-service representatives; which has developed into the arrangement of the regional and zone servants of today. From that time onward, also, the pioneer service, by those devoting their full time to house-to-house work, increased. These matters were not deliberately arranged in advance by men, but the Lord himself directed them, because he is in charge of the service work of carrying the message to the people. He directs his angels what to do, and through them steers his witnesses on earth in the right direction, and all praise and honor are due to the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Note now Revelation 9:16: “And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.” It is written (19:14): “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, elothed in fine linen, white and clean.” These armies doubtless include the myriads of angels, as well as the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth. Joel 2:11 reads: “His camp is very great: for he is strong that executcth his word.” God’s army is well-equipped and is fearless. (Job 39:19-25) This two hundred million of the Lord’s army sound the message of woe to the world rulers under Satan. Jehovah’s anointed ones on earth should hereby be encouraged. Let them rejoice and say: ‘They that be with us are more than they that be with the enemy.’—2 Ki. 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John’s vision discloses that the horses and riders have breastplates of fire, jacinth, and brimstone, and the horses had heads like lions, and out of their mouths issued fire and brimstone. (Rev. 9:17) Such a fiery, sulphurous breastplate would be a terrifying sight for the enemy to behold. At Isaiah 63: 4 the Lord says: “The day of vengeance is in mine heart.” Such also is the heart attitude of the Lord’s army, pictured by the fiery breastplate, and that fiery zeal for Jehovah is pictured as covering the most vital organ, to wit, the heart, and it terrifies the enemy but speaks victory to God’s anointed.—Phil. 1; 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ Jesus, “the Lion of the tribe of Juda,” leads the army of the Lord, and the members of his body are appropriately described as having heads like lions. This is a very appropriate description of the cavalry division of the army of the Lord, which is strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. “What is stronger than a lion?” Like those who followed David, they are “men ... fit for the battle, . . . whose faces were like the faces of lions”. (1 Chron. 12: 8) The Lord’s people are of the Davidic class. Proverbs 28:1: “The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.”—Proverbs 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle John declares (Rev. 9:18,19) that the power of these soldiers of the Lord is in their mouths and in their tails, which are like the tail of a serpent. Jehovah has put his message in the mouth of his people and has made them his witnesses while he does his great “strange work”. (Isa. 51:16) These preach his Word and sing his praises, and this message issues from their mouths. The symbolic “tail” is the prophetic message which they deliver. God has not authorized the wicked to speak his Word, but has commissioned his anointed witnesses to deliver his message of truth and speak his word of vengeance against the enemy organization. (Ps. 50 :16,17) These servants of the Lord speak the message by their mouths, and leave the prophetic message, as the “tail”, behind, which the people read; and therefore they assault the enemy organization “both coming and going”. The public witness message that went forth from Toronto was spoken by word of mouth and broadcast over fifty-three radio stations. Without a doubt a great number of mouths (loud-speakers of radio receiving sets) took the message from the ether and heralded it to millions of listening people. The immediate response by wire and letters from every part of the country proves this fact to be correct. Then followed the world-wide distribution of the message in printed form. This message from the mouth and “tail” has stung the enemy organization, and still stings. By the three destructive agencies, “fire,” “smoke,” and “brimstone”, many were killed; that is to say, their influence and power to deceive the people was rendered nil. The message of the Lord, following in printed form in the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font8"> went both to the governing powers and to the people. It was not man’s message, but God’s message taken from his Word, and tells of his destruction of the unrighteous systems. Isaiah 30: 33, speaking of that destruction at Armageddon, says: “The breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. For Tophet [the valley of Hinnom, where devil worship was carried on] is ordained of old; yea, for the king [that is, the worldly ruling powers] it is prepared: he [Jehovah] hath made it deep, and large [to accommodate all the wicked] ; the pile thereof is fire and much wood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This “strange work” of declaring his vengeance against “Christendom.” the Lord does when he comes to his temple, to wit, from A.D. 1918 onward. Psalm 11: 4, 6 states: “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: Lis eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. Upon the wicked lie shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their eup.” That memage, spoken by word of mouth, and then thrust into the hands of millions of people, and left behind for them to “chew on”, left a smarting sensation like the sting of a serpent. God had said: “Behold, I will send serpents, . . . which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord” (Jer. 8:17); and this prophecy was fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The public press, which is the tool and mouthpiece of the ruling powers, immediately thereafter sent up a cry or howl, as a result of the sting. The Toronto press the next day after the convention speech urged the legal department of the government to take immediate steps to deport the public speaker of the occasion who read the resolution, and then vigorously denounced the message that was delivered in support. The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> broke its silence, and for once screeched and howled against the truth and delivered the cries of the clergy. The National Broadcasting Company, another mouthpiece of the unholy alliance, joined in the howl and denunciation, and ever thereafter has refused to have its radio facilities again used in broadcasting the message of God’s Word of truth. In an effort to offset the truth it sets itself up as the one to determine what shall be given to the people in religious matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was the Lord that sent forth his invisible angels to sound the trumpet and direct the message, and he caused his visible servants on earth to join in that work. By their mouths they have spoken the message; and they have left behind “the tail”, which is the prophetic message, and this has caused the Devil’s representatives to squirm and writhe under the torment. Manifestly this is what the prophet saw when he wrote (Psalm 2:4): “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.” God’s people laugh with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The public message delivered at Toronto showed the close alliance between the clergy, Big Business, and the politicians, the three elements of Satan’s official organization. Thereafter many of the clergy went out of the business and went into commercial pursuits. Their preaching business was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Revelation 9:20, 21 adds: “And the rest of the men whieh were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood; which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.” Men of the world of all divisions thereof still insist on a government without Jehovah God and without Christ Jesus. Even though the truth is pointed out to them that God has set his King upon his throne, and the time has eome to establish his kingdom, and that this is the panacea for the ills of humankind, they still persist in their wicked course of oppressing mankind, and insist on ruling them. They refuse to welcome earth’s rightful King. They continue to bow down to Satan and his doctrines concerning man’s origin and his destiny. They worship material things rather than the Creator. The influence of Satan still induces many of them to hate (which is murder) the Lord’s people and to persecute them. Many who profess to be Christians still continue their illicit relationship with the unrighteous things of this world, which is spiritual fornication. They have a preference for the doctrine of devils rather than for the Word of God. They rob and kill their fellow men. They rob God of that to whieh he is justly entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH now gives to his faithful servants glimpses of the magnificent arrangement and order that will prevail throughout all the earth after his slaughter of all enemies of his theocratic government, at Armageddon, the universal war now near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By his prophets he has declared that all the survivors on earth of that greatest trouble of all time shall regularly assemble to commemorate the mighty acts of the Most High God. Solemn feasts of worship have been divinely ordained for that purpose. For the benefit of all who come to those festal assemblies Jehovah has provided good traffic rules, as symbolically pictured in Ezekiel’s vision of the temple. The temple rule is stated thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the solemn feasts, he that entcreth in by the way of the north gate [of the temple] to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it [straight before him (R.V.)].” (Ezek. 46:9) The line of happy celebrants is kept moving in one direction, so there is no disorder; showing that with Jehovah everything is orderly. Furthermore, the people in exercising their privileges in connection with God’s temple, must go clear through, and not merely a part of the way, if they will be reconciled to God and be brought permanently into his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In “Christendom” the leaders have been foolish shepherds. In Jehovah’s organization the earthly “prince”, that is, the ancient prophets and other faithful witnesses from Abel down to John the Baptist, resurrected as perfect men (Heb. 11: 35, 39, 40), will with authority always direct the people in the right way. “And the prince [meaning each of the 'princes in all the earth’ who ‘shall rule in judgment’ (Ps. 45:16; Isa. 32:1) as visible representatives of the permanent theocratic government] in the midst of them [the people], when they go in [the temple], shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. And in the feasts, and in the solemnities, the meat [or meal] offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram; and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.” (Ezek. 46:10,11) The princes are thus in a responsible position toward Jehovah, and during the thousand-year reign of the Lord Jesus Christ will see that the people practice justice and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The symbolic temple had gates, both inner and outer gates, on the north, south, and east. The east inner gate of the temple will be open on state occasions. As to this it is written: “Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the sabbath day; then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.” (Ezek. 46:12) This is a further testimony of the loving-kindness of Jehovah, showing his consideration for the faithful prophets of old and that they will be favored with a “better resurrection” than those who come up in the general earthly resurrection. (Heb. 10: 35) There will be nothing about their service that is compulsory, but they will serve joyfully, willingly and with a ready mind. They will</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">be happy to worship and make offerings of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord privately and when not acting in an official capacity with the people. Note that when the princes conclude offering their voluntary (or free-will) offering ‘he shall go forth; and after he goeth forth one shall shut the gate’. This shows that the doors of audience with Jehovah’s heavenly priesthood, of which Christ Jesus is the High Priest, will always be ready to open to these princes of the earth whenever their personal needs require them to seek communion with the Lord of heaven. As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer: and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.” —Isa. 65:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, provision is made for daily sacrifices of praise to Jehovah. The temple rule says: “Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish ; thou shalt prepare it every morning. And thou shalt prepare a meat [meal] offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat [meal] offering continually, by a perpetual ordinance, unto the Lord. Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat [meal] offering, and the oil, every morning, for a continual burnt offering.” (Ezek. 46:13-15) All this is symbolic or prophetic: The acknowledgment of praise and thanksgiving will be offered up to Jehovah God through his royal priesthood consisting of Christ Jesus and his 144,000 associates in heaven, and it shall no more be that “the daily sacrifice [continual ascending-sacrifice </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]</span><span class="font8"> shall be taken away”. (Dan. 12:11) Then the Satanic political organizations symbolized as the “beast” and the “image of the beast” will have been disposed of, so that they cannot interfere on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “princes in all the earth” are granted an everlasting favor from Jehovah. Concerning this it is written: “Thus saitli the Lord God, If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall [belong to his sons. ff.P.] ; it shall be their possession by inheritance.” (Ezek 46:16) In the day of ancient Israel sons were raised up to perpetuate the family name and possessions that these might remain for a lasting inheritance. All this was necessary because of the dying condition of the human race Under Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus the resurrected leaders and faithful prophets or princes will not div “Neither can they die any more.” (Luke 20:36) They will not need sons to maintain the family inheritance, forasmuch as these princes are resurrected by and receive life through Christ Jesus and thus will be “sons” by reason of their inheritance from their princely Father, Christ Jesus. It is therefore plain to be seen that the terms “princes” and “his sons” here used jointly stand as a prophetic picture of all the “princes in all the earth” who are to be made the “children” of The Christ, the great Prince of Glory. (Sv Psalm 45:16.) Therefore this prophecy given to Ezekiel pictures that these princes shall never have their names die out and what God has ‘given to them as an inheritance shall be their possession by an inheritance for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “princes” appear to have granted to them certain discretions in matters of service unto Jehovah. This is pic tured in these words: “But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year 30C,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">of liberty [the jubilee year] ; after it shall return to the prince; but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them,” (Ezek. 46:17) There will be a world-wide service to be performed during the period of reconstruction, and it seems that the Lord will leave it to the discretion of the “princes in all the earth” as to whom they shall grant the honor of special service in Jehovah’s organization. The opportunity will be afforded to those of the people who really love God to show their faithfulness and their devotion and readiness to serve, and they will qualify themselves for service. It is the privilege of the remnant who now have children to teach them to really devote themselves to Jehovah God and to his service and to be in line for and ready for service under the direction of the “princes in all the earth”. Such is likewise the privilege of the Jonadabs or the present-day people of good will who have children. Let all such children be encouraged to read </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and study it with their parents. Take the children with you to the study classes where the Watchtower publications are studied. Remember that God’s injunction to you is that your children must seek righteousness and meekness before Armageddon begins. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> will be of great value to you in giving heed to the admonition of the Lord, and will enable your children to learn the way of righteousness. No doubt the “princes” or rulers will bestow benefits of special service upon those who possess the qualifications to serve and who are anxious to serve and to please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The full office of service in the earth is the inheritance of “the princes”, but this work will require service of many, and the “princes” will have the privilege of opening to others the opportunity of assisting in the work under the direction of the “princes in all the earth”. The privilege thus bestowed as a “gift” or favor “shall be his [that is, the servant’s] to the year of liberty”, and then it shall “return to the prince”. That means that the “servants” may have this privilege of service under the princes or rulers and that the honor that the position carries with it will endure to the end of the Millennium, and at the end thereof these servants shall not be different from others of mankind who maintain their integrity and who will then “be delivered . . . into the glorious liberty of the children of God”. (Rom. 8:21) It will be wonderful, however, to be privileged to serve the people under the direction of the rulers of the earth, and the faithful on earth should now instruct their children to this effect. Whatever glory the servants do have and enjoy in doing service will belong to the princes, but they will enjoy it by favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This scripture shows that persons of Hebrew nationality (sometimes by themselves and by others loosely called “Jews”) will have no favors different from those of other nationalities. During the Millennium Hebrew persons could at the very most have service under the princes. Such persons will not be favored any more than any other people; Jesus’ words show it may be “more tolerable” for these others. Faithfulness and devotion to the Lord and his kingdom will bring to such his blessings. Although as a people the fleshly Jews have been unfaithful to God, especially during the time of their covenant of old, yet Jehovah will extend his mercy to the redeemable ones, and because of the faithfulness of their fathers, which fathers are now during the Millennium made “princes in all the earth”, God will give opportunity to them to be fully reconciled to him. Of the remnant of the Jews that accepted Christ Jesus it is written: “They are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.” (Rom. 11: 28) There would be no reason why any Jew after the flesh should be given any special service during the Millennial reign unless he is specially qualified and devoted to Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus. The above-quoted words of Paul cannot be construed to mean that persons of Hebrew nativity will be given a favor above other people. Every one who comes into God’s organization must have faith like unto Abraham’s, and in that way they become Israelites indeed, true Jews, praisers of the Most High God and his loyal servants, under the King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah makes it plainly to appear that no oppression shall be tolerated in the kingdom. “Moreover, the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession: but he shall give his sons’ inheritance out of his own possession; that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.” (Ezek. 46:18) This shows that what God assigns to the prince shall not encroach upon the people’s inheritance. All the earth becomes the habitation of obedient mankind, and this they shall hold for ever. The people shall dwell permanently and in full security. The princes will acquire no glory or wealth at the expense of the people, nor will the people be scattered. The ‘rulers in all the earth’ will bring the people into close connection as one big human family of great peace, and all will give praise to the everlasting Creator.—Ps. 150: 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EAGERNESS FOR TRUTH IN NEW ZEALAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;I was witnessing to a lady one Sunday morning a little way out of Auckland. After reading the testimony card she said: ‘Wait a minute, please.’ She went inside for a little while, then came out with a sixpence on the card and said: ‘I will take the four booklets.’ I gave her </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Consolation, Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom or Romanism,</span><span class="font8"> a real good combination. She told me she could not afford to take the new book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font8"> but when I come around again she would take it. It was the last one I had with me. Before I left I noticed a cop’s hat hanging in the hall. I went to the next house and presented the testimony card again, and it was read both sides and the lady looked at my hand and said: ‘I will have </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.’</span><span class="font8"> She gave me 2/- for it, and said the extra would help to meet my expenses. Then I gave her the combination of booklets above mentioned, and she was delighted. On leaving that house I heard someone whistling. I looked around and there was a man standing in the garden of the house where I had just left. He said: ‘Here, I want you!’ He went indoors, and I thought I was in for trouble. When I got to the door the lady came out again and said: ‘I will take that book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font8"> if you like.’ ‘Sorry,’ I said, ‘you can’t have it now.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Because the lady next door took it joyfully.’ She looked very much disappointed. Then the man that called me in came to the door and said: ‘Why in the dickens didn’t you take it when you had the chance? Now I have missed Judge Rutherford’s latest book. That’s a woman all over!’ He asked if it was possible to get another. ‘Yes, sure. I will be here again next Sunday and bring you one.’ ‘What!’ he said, ‘wait till next Sunday. Oh dear, oh dear!’ The woman said: ‘If I give you the contribution now, could you post one to me?’ ‘Yes, of course.’ She got the shilling, and threepence extra for postage. The man said: ‘Now I will get the book.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“He often gives out the message of the Kingdom to his fellow signalmen during the early hours of the morning, and does so by means of the telephone. While on night duty, and during intervals between traffic, the signalmen of a dozen stations often link up together as if they were all in the same room. These stations are up to thirty miles apart. The publisher takes this opportunity to give out the Kingdom message, and as interest is shown by his fellow signalmen he posts the books and booklets to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ZONE SERVANT MEETS PARSON IN TRANSVAAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I happened to knock at the door of the English parson of the place. He was polite. I explained briefly what I was doing and gave him a copy of ‘The Protest’ (re banning of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Riches).</span><span class="font8"> He then remarked that he was in favor of certain books’ being banned because the uneducated people misunderstand them even though the author’s ideas might have been well meant. I then said: ‘Have you ever thought how many millions have misunderstood and still are misunderstanding the Bible? Do you mean the Bible should be banned, too? And furthermore, aren’t there many people who have already misunderstood some of your sermons?’ ‘Yes, they did,’ he answered. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘why not stop preaching!’ He immediately got up, went for a donation and took </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font8"> with the remark, ‘I’d like to study those books.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND-CAR EPISODES IN NOVA SCOTIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We were running our sound-car one evening near Digby, N.S., and had on two of the ‘Face the Facts’ records. We noticed a car stop and listen for a few minutes, then it drove on past about fifty yards and turned and listened again, and then drove back right close to the sound-car. Presently the woman beckoned me to come over, and they asked if we sold any of those records. Fearing a trap was being set I was careful in my reply, but all was O.K. Result: Placed a set of records, also </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font8"> and took a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> subscription. A couple of weeks later near Yarmouth we had one horn of sound-car toward the town and the other toward the Old Folks Home or county home. Towards the close of the lecture we saw a man coming down from the home<sup>-</sup>; but on seeing the ladies in the car he was going on by, so I spoke to him and asked if he could hear it O.K. at the home, and he seemed delighted. Took </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font8"> and said he was a Catholic but didn’t believe in the ‘Purgatory’ racket. He had l ead </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font8"> over and over and knew what a Jonadab is, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ILLINOISANS WOULDN’T SIGN THE COMPLAINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The police chief said: ‘If you will take down that one sign all the rest of your work is O.K.’ He was asked if he would furnish the name and address of a complainant if he disturbed us any more. He said he surely would. ‘Very well, that is all we ask. Goodbye, we are going back to work’; and we did. We marched in the main business district again. The chief had said: ‘If you carry that one sign there will be trouble.’ On Saturday, September 19, the officers took thirteen marchers down to the station after fifteen phone calls came in. All of them were asked to come right down and sign a complaint; and all refused. The marchers were let go at once; they had not been detained more than five minutes. The following Monday two publishers went to see the chief to find out if there were any complaints signed. On this occasion the chief was very much a different man. He said: ‘We have investigated your work, and it is all right. You can go ahead and come to this town any time you want to.’ He also said: ‘Any time they won’t sign a complaint I am off of them.’ He said: ‘If you would take off that one sign there would not be any trouble, and I don’t like it myself.’ We told him we would rather take off all the rest, that one thing was commanded to be made known b\ Jehovah and now is the time it must be done, and no power would be able to stop it.”</span></p>

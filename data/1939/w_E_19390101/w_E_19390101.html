<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DELIVERANCE GUARANTEED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“They shall not prevail against thee.”—Jer. 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TEHOVAH’S power is not limited, and his arm I is not shortened. He will fully bring to pass his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font3"> every purpose. The giving of his word of promise is a full and complete guarantee that what he has said shall be done. To know Jehovah and to believe his Word gives courage to the people that serve him. A comparatively small number of persons know of and appreciate these truths, because only a few know God and rely upon his Word. Those who do know Jehovah and who are in a covenant to do his will now have a grave responsibility resting upon them, the proper performance of which affords them an inestimable privilege and is accompanied by suffering. They need courage, and Jehovah provides that which is needed for them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> For centuries many nations of the earth have claimed to be Christian nations. They have possessed the Bible and pretended to teach it and to rely upon it. During the earlier part of that period doubtless many among the ruling factors of the nations did believe and rely upon Jehovah’s Word. Their modern-day successors in authority have chosen exactly the opposite course; they refuse to give honor and praise to Jehovah’s name, and the mass of the people blindly follow in that same way of unrighteousness. The net result is that all the nations called “Christendom” have forgotten God, and his judgment against those nations is written and soon will be executed. Ancient Jerusalem and the people of that land were in a covenant to do God’s will, and that people had sinned by giving their praise and worship to Jehovah’s enemies. Jerusalem was the type of present-day “Christendom”, and what came to pass upon Jerusalem and the people of that land is certain to befall “Christendom”. Jehovah commissioned his servant Jeremiah and sent him to give warning to Jerusalem and to all the people thereabout, making known to them that God had written his judgment against them and would shortly execute the same, and that any who would live must forsake Jerusalem and serve God’s appointed King. In fulfillment of that prophetic picture Jehovah has taken out from the world “a people for his name”, whom he has made in these days his witnesses. (Acts-15:14) To that company of witnesses now on the earth God gives a commission, and they are caused to fulfill the picture made by Jeremiah. They, as the true followers of Christ Jesus, are sent forth to give the warning to “Christendom” and to all the people thereabout that the final judgment of Jehovah against them has been written and will be executed within a short time, and this warning is given to the people in order that those of good will toward God may flee to the only place of safety.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The terms of the commission which Jehovah gave to Jereiniah are exactly the same as of the commission God has given to his witnesses now on the earth. In that commission Jehovah, amongst other things, employed these words, to wit: “And I ■will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.”—Jer. 1:1G-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The mission upon which Jeremiah was sent was fraught with great danger, as the above words clearly indicate. Likewise the mission of Jehovah’s witnesses is now fraught with great danger because of the malicious animosity toward them of the ruling factors of “Christendom”. Jeremiah was warned that he must not fear or be dismayed because of the opposition to him. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses are now warned that they must not fear or be dismayed or frightened because of the threats made against them and the assaults and persecution brought upon them. As God had surrounded Jeremiah with protection, so he now says to his faithful witnesses on the earth: “I have made thee this day a defenced city [organization].” God told Jeremiah that the ruling powers, particularly the religious element, aided by the politicians and commercial crowd and their devotees, would bitterly oppose him; so likewise Jehovah’s witnesses now know that the religionists, the politicians and the traffickers are allied together in a conspiracy against God and his kingdom and that they bitterly oppose Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. Furthermore Jehovah said to Jeremiah: “And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The words of the text, “But they shall not prevail against thee,” are the words chosen for the year text for 1939. Judging from past experience, and trusting wholly in the Word of God, his people know that strenuous times are here and that in the near future the witnesses of the Lord may be required to endure many hardships while carrying out their Godgiven commission. Those who trust in God and Christ now see the Devil and all his forces attempting to destroy all those that love and serve Jehovah. The Devil and his invisible angels have gathered all the nations of “Christendom” together against God’s faithful people. Visible to human eyes are the leaders of religion and their allies, particularly the dictators of the world, who are cruelly and maliciously bent on destroying all who proclaim the name of Jehovah, his King and his kingdom. By faith God’s people also see Christ Jesus and his invisible hosts surrounding the faithful ones on earth with a full and complete protection. The faithful witnesses of the Lord completely rely upon God and Christ, and they know that victory for the Lord is certain and that their own complete deliverance is guaranteed by the Lord, because the Lord has said to them concerning the enemy: “They shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Everyone who believes and relies upon that promise will be courageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CORROBORATIVE PROOF</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah is under no obligation to give corroborative proof of his faithfulness, but he does so for the comfort of his people in this time of stress and that their hope may be sure to them; and such hope is “an anchor of the soul, both sure and sted-fast”. The people of God now on the earth are facing the most critical condition of all time. Now they need to be very courageous, and such courage comes only by knowing and relying upon the Lord, and they know that they are being fully backed up and supported by the Most High. The Lord has placed within the reach of everyone consecrated to him the means of obtaining the necessary knowledge, and, when receiving such knowledge, they must rely upon that which comes from Jehovah. For many centuries God dealt with his chosen people of old, using them to make types and prophetic dramas of coming events, and he caused record thereof to be made for the benefit of his consecrated people now on the earth. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15:4) In the present time God brings to pass events in fulfillment of those prophetic dramas, and he reveals to his people the meaning of that which was long ago made and recorded, and a knowledge and understanding thereof is now of special benefit and encouragement to the faithful. On many occasions God fought the battles for his covenant people and delivered them from the enemy, and, seeing that such things are recorded for the benefit of those now on earth, we do well to recount some of them and keep always in mind what God has done and what he has promised to do, that we may be strong in faith and that our courage may not fail. Therefore there is here set out a brief statement of some of these pictures long ago made by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ENSAMPLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> At Genesis 14:1-20 is the record of a war of conquest by four combined kings coining from the land of Nimrod, or Shinar, and which was prosecuted against Sodom, and during which war Lot, the kinsman of Abraham, was captured and carried away. Abraham with his servants pursued the enemy, and recovered and fully delivered Lot and all that Lot had. There Abraham pictured God, while Lot pictured the “great multitude” now coming forth and which company must be involved in the great battle that is near; and in that fight the Greater Abraham will gain the victory for his royal house and their “companions” and will fully deliver the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9-17) To Abraham, the king-priest Melchizedek said: “Blessed be the Most High God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.” This is an assurance to Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions that God will fight their battles and gain the victory for them at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> God sent his angels to Sodom and to the house of Lot to bear a message to Lot. A mob of Sodomites attempted to commit an assault upon the angels (who appeared as men). Lot defended the angels, and the mob said to Lot: “Now will we deal worse with thee than with them.” (Gen. 19:1-29) For the protection of Lot and his household against that mob the Lord, operating through his angels, smote the members of the mob with blindness and thereafter led Lot and his household to safety out of the city immediately before destroying Sodom. Here again is a picture of God’s protection and deliverance of those who are devoted to him and who are associated with his service. The two angels appearing there as men seemed to picture the members of the royal house, including the members of Jehovah’s witnesses now on the earth, and whom Jehovah by Christ Jesus sends to the modern-day Sodom, that is, “Christendom,” to act in behalf of the “great multitude”, which was pictured by Lot and his household. That such was a prophetic picture is testified to by the apostle. (2 Pet. 2:6-9) Also it shows God’s protection and deliverance of those who love and serve him and that he always cares for his own; and this is made known now for the encouragement of his people on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• Pharaoh, the Devil’s visible representative in Egypt (the world), put into operation a scheme to destroy Moses at the time of his birth. (Ex. 1:8-22) The Lord God caused that scheme to fail, by miraculously delivering Moses. When Moses grew to manhood he was compelled to flee the land of Egypt for a time in order to prevent his destruction by Satan’s representative. Then Jehovah sent Moses back into Egypt to serve notice upon Pharaoh and to deliver God’s chosen people. The climax came when Pharaoh and all of his army, horses and chariots, pursued the Israelites to destroy them, who were being led by Moses. At the Red sea Jehovah exercised his power on behalf of and gave the victory to Moses and the Israelites. The miracle there wrought caused the Israelites to fear Jehovah and to believe him and to serve him and to obey his servant Moses. That great victory over the enemy and the deliverance of the Israelites by drowning Pharaoh’s army in the sea brought forth songs of praise to the name of Jehovah. (Ex. 15:1-22) The words of that victory song sung by Moses and the children of Israel foretell the song of victory and praise that will be sung by the “remnant” and the “great multitude”, and which song now by faith they are singing unto Jehovah. With full confidence in the Lord they sing now: “Jehovah is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation. . . . Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name. Who is like unto thee, 0 Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?” (Ex. 15:2,3,11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> That song further foretells the great victory of the Lord over the combined elements of the Devil’s organization that now seek the destruction of God’s people, and it was recorded for the comfort of those who are now facing the enemy; and concerning the victory upon the enemy Jehovah says: “Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; . . . till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.”—Ex. 15:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> This is a further guarantee to the “remnant” and to the “great multitude” that God, through Christ his Executioner, will deliver them at Armageddon. It is true that some of the remnant and some of the Jonadabs, who are faithful, may be slain at Armageddon^ but the Scriptures give assurance of a quick resurrection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Out from Egypt the Israelites began their long trek to the land of Canaan under the leadership of Moses, and in due time they pitched camp at Rephi-dim. There the Amalekites attempted to destroy the Israelites. At God’s direction by Moses the Israelites took the offensive. They did not hole up in the rocks or behind breastworks, but in obedience to Moses’ command they went out and fought the enemy. The Lord, in that battle led by Joshua, who represented Christ, assaulted the enemy, gained a great victory and delivered the Israelites. It was the victory of Jehovah for his people. (Ex. 17:8-16) That it was Jehovah’s battle and that he gave the victory is shown by the fact that Joshua prevailed only when the hands of Moses were held up. Thus is shown that Jehovah God will uphold the Greater Joshua at the battle of Armageddon and will completely rout the enemy. Now Satan’s forces go forth attempting to destroy God’s people, and those who trust wholly in Jehovah and his Vindicator, Christ Jesus, must take the offensive and go forth into the battle trusting the Lord, who gives assurance of their deliverance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah then and there declared that Amalek should perish: “I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.” In due time that final destruction came. Amalek was the one who fought against the Israelites; and said the Lord: “But his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.” (Num. 24:20) That latter end came in the time of Mordecai and Esther, when God delivered his people from the hands of their oppressors. Religionists have taken the lead in fighting against God’s people; and in his due time, at the beginning of Armageddon, the end of those religionists shall be that they shall perish for ever. This is pictured in the drama recorded in the book of Esther, chapters three to nine. The Amalekite, Haman, conspired to bring about the destruction of Mordecai and Esther and all of God’s chosen people in the land of Persia. The result was that Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had built for Mordecai, and in the battle that followed the Amalekites were completely wiped out. That prophetic drama disclosed Christ Jesus and his host of angels destroying all the enemies and delivering those who faithfully serve Jehovah. This is another picture made as a guarantee of deliverance of God’s people. All those who have sought refuge in the Lord and his organization should now carefully study the book of Esther and the explanation thereof, which is found in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> pages 9-168.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> As the Israelites journeyed forward toward the land of promise the Devil sought their destruction by means of his religionists. The Midianites practiced the devil religion of Baal-peor. The spiritual adviser of the Midianites was the unfaithful prophet Balaam. The Lord brought destruction upon the Midianites and upon Balaam. Thus the Lord gave assurance to his faithful servants that they shall be delivered from the religionists and their allies that now seek their destruction. — Num. 25:6-18; 31:1-17; Rev. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> As the Israelites continued to journey on to the land of Canaan God’s enemies fought against them. Arad the Canaanite, Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, one after the other, assaulted the Israelites, and the enemy was overthrown and destroyed by Jehovah, and in each instance Jehovah fought the battle for his covenant people. (Num. 21:1-3, 21-35) Thereafter when the Israelites were assembled on the plains of Moab Moses recounted to them how Jehovah had fought their battles for them and delivered them from their enemies. (Deut. 2:26-37; 3:1-13) Concerning those battles Moses said to the Israelites: “And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not; for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.” “And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings; so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. Ye shall not fear them; for the Lord your God he shall fight for you.”—Deut. 3: 2,3, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah’s time came for his covenant people to enter the land of Canaan, which at that time was held in possession by the enemies of the Lord. Putting Joshua in the lead as visible commander, God led the host of Israel across the flood waters of the Jordan and in the very face of Jericho, and caused the walls of Jericho to fall down flat. Thereafter the enemies of the stronghold of Ai made war upon God’s covenant people who, under the leadership of Joshua, fought against Ai, and God gave the victory to the Israelites. (Joshua 1-8) The Gib-eonites voluntarily put themselves under the protection of Joshua, and then the five kings of the Amorites conspired together to destroy Gibeon because they had sought protection by associating themselves with Joshua. (Joshua, chapters 9 and 10) The Gibeonites pictured the “great multitude” fleeing to Christ Jesus for protection. At God’s command Joshua courageously led his army against the conspirators. “And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.”—Joshua 10:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> That was one of the great battles foretelling God’s purpose to destroy his enemies at Armageddon, the record of which is made for the encouragement of those people of Jehovah who now serve him as Armageddon approaches. The great battle of Gibeon was fought by the Lord then as he will fight for his people at Armageddon: “And it came to pass, as they [the enemy] fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.”—Josh. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Thereafter the remaining kings of northern Canaan all formed a combine to destroy Joshua and his army. “And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. So Joshua came, and all the people of war with them, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.”—Josh. 11: 6-8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The combined enemy was bent on the destruction of the Israelites, even as the religionists and their allies are now in the conspiracy to destroy the people of God on earth, and which the presentday enemy does because God’s consecrated people uncompromisingly and unqualifiedly advocate the kingdom of God under Christ. It is written concerning that combined enemy that came against the Israelites, and which words apply to God’s people: “There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all other they took in battle. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses.”—Josh. 11:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The record of that victory was made especially for the comfort and encouragement of God’s people now on the earth. There Joshua pictured Christ Jesus, and those Israelites who followed and obeyed his command foreshadowed those who today believe on Jehovah and Christ and who earnestly and faithfully follow Christ Jesus and joyfully obey his commandments. Those who really love Jehovah and his King and kingdom now will not fear the enemy, but will boldly go forward in obedience to the Lord’s command.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> It appears that one of the major difficulties of God’s covenant people is lack of faith in Jehovah. Particularly is this shown in the experiences of the Israelites. Whenever they departed from the Lord and turned to religion, affliction came upon them. When they repented and cried unto God, he showed mercy toward them and fought their battles and delivered them. The king of Mesopotamia for several years oppressed the Israelites by Jehovah’s permission, because the Israelites had turned to the Devil religion. Then they repented and cried unto Jehovah, who in mercy and for his name’s sake heard their cry and sent them a deliverer. Jehovah then fought the battles of Israel and gave them the victory, using Othniel and Ehud as his chosen instruments to accomplish his will.—Judg. 3:7-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> Thereafter Jabin, king of Canaan, and his captain, Sisera, were permitted to oppress the Israelites because that people had become unfaithful to God and had turned to the Devil religion. Again the Israelites repented and cried unto Jehovah, who heard them and who used the prophetess Deborah and Barak to lead the battle against the enemy, which Jehovah fought, and overthrew and destroyed the enemy at the first battle of Megiddo. (Judg. 4:1-24) In that battle Jehovah used the stars of heaven and the swift waters of the river Kishon to destroy the enemy. (Judg. 5:1,19-21) That was an example of Jehovah’s unlimited power disclosed and foretelling what He will do to his enemies at the final battle of Armageddon, and the record thereof is made that the covenant people of God may now have their faith made strong. Trusting wholly in the Lord and continuing to perform their duty unto God, without fear of creatures, they shall receive Jehovah’s protection, and share with the Lord in the victory.—Ps. 83: 8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>82</sup> Again the faith of the Israelites weakened and they turned to the Devil religion, and God delivered them into the hands of Midian for seven years. Again the Israelites repented and cried unto God, and God reminded them that he had been their deliverer, but that the Israelites had become of little faith. To the Israelites he said: “And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice.” (Judg. 6:10) Then Jehovah raised up Gideon, who, under the Lord’s command, led the faithful Israelites against the enemy, and routed and destroyed them. (Judg. 6:1-40; 7:1-25; 8:1-35) There was made another prophetic picture of what Jehovah will do for his faithful servants at the battle of Armageddon.—Ps. 83:11,12; Isa. 10:26; Jer. 1:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>83</sup> The Israelites became weak in faith, again fell away to the Devil religion, and Jehovah delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. That oppressed people cried unto God. Then he raised up Samson and used him to break the power of the Philistines and to deliver the Israelites. That was another evidence of God’s mercy and unlimited power exercised in behalf of those who serve him faithfully.—Judges 13-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>84</sup> God anointed the shepherd lad David to be king over Israel. David beheld the giant Goliath frightening the Israelites into inactivity and defying the Almighty God. David’s zeal was stirred to incandescent heat and, trusting wholly in the power of the Almighty God, he boldly engaged the giant in combat and slew him and put the Philistines to flight. That is an example of what Christ, the Greater David, will do to the enemy who are now persecuting God’s covenant people. (1 Samuel, chapters 17 and 18) David exhibited the faith of God’s people which they must now have and exercise. When David was installed as king of Israel, the Philistines attempted to destroy him. Twice the enemy joined battle with David, at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon, and David completely routed the enemy. (1 Chron. 14:8-17) It was God who gained the victory for his faithful servant David, and it is God’s sure promise that at Armageddon he will again fight for his people as he fought for them at Mount Perazim and Gibeon. (Isa. 28:21) David was a type of Christ, God’s Anointed, who will completely destroy the enemy at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>85</sup> Later another prophetic picture was made and recorded, showing Jehovah’s protection and deliverance of his faithful servants. The people of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir formed a conspiracy to destroy God’s covenant people, and, in their effort to carry out that conspiracy, marched on Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat, in command of God’s covenant people, was instructed by the Lord what he must do. The enemy far outnumbered the Israelites and were fully equipped for war. God assured Jehoshaphat and the Israelites and others with him that they had no occasion to fear the enemy, for the reason that the battle is God’s; that the duty of the Israelites was to boldly march out and meet the enemy, singing, as they went, the praises of Jehovah. Then God fought their battle and the enemy was completely destroyed; and that was another example of God’s unlimited power exercised in behalf of those who love and obey him. Thus Jehovah foretold again what will come to pass at the battle of Armageddon in behalf of his people. Do you believe it? Then deport yourself accordingly.—2 Chron. 20:1-29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">*• The Assyrian king Sennacherib marched against Jerusalem, bullying the Israelites and defying the Almighty God. Thus he pictured the combined opponents of God’s kingdom that now, in defiance of Almighty God and Christ his King, march out to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. Hezekiah, the king of Israel, prayed unto Jehovah for protection and deliverance, and in answer to that prayer Jehovah said: “Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. . . . For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake. Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.” (Isa. 37:33-36) This is further proof that Jehovah will deliver his faithful covenant people and completely destroy the enemy. That was a test of the faith of Hezekiah and the other Israelites, and God rewarded their faith. A similar test has come to God’s people now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> Faithless Israelites turned again to the Devil religion and were carried away in captivity. Later God brought the faithful remnant thereof back into the place he had assigned to them, and there he prospered them. Then the wicked forces of Gog of the land of Magog gathered together to destroy the faithful Israelites. Here again Jehovah furnishes a picture of the host of wicked angels, invisible to human eyes but who bear rule over the earth, together with their religious allies on earth, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Fascists and their insane radicals, who have formed themselves into a conspiracy and are marching to destroy the servants of God now on earth, including both the remnant and those who will form the great multitude. These covenant people of God are now restored to their proper place as servants of the Most High and his King. The combined enemy is fatally bent on the destruction of the servants of the Lord. In the prophetic picture Jehovah maneuvered the combined enemy and permitted them to come up against his people. In this was pictured “the last days”, the time of great peril, the time which now is at hand. Jehovah defeated the enemy, and will again defeat them. Shall Jehovah’s covenant people now on earth fear or be dismayed because of the enemy marching against them? What Jehovah said concerning Gog and the land of Magog now applies with stronger force concerning the present-day enemy and His own people, to wit: “And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel [God’s covenant people now on the earth], as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, 0 Gog, before their eyes. Thus saith the Lord God, Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them? And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel.” “And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against his brother. And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.”—Ezek. 38:16-19, 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” Jehovah is the Almighty God of all power, and he will show his strength in behalf of those who are devoted to him; therefore they need not fear: “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” —2 Chron. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">** The three faithful Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, were under the power of Nebuchadnezzar. Because they refused to yield to Satanic religion, determining to remain faithful and true to the Most High, King Nebuchadnezzar caused them to be cast into a red-hot fiery furnace. The flames did not scorch them, because they were protected by the Lord; but the flames destroyed the men who threw them into the fire. Because of their faith and faithfulness the Lord God protected his and delivered them. Another faithful Hebrew, Daniel, was betrayed to the king by those men who sought his destruction. Fearless of the enemy and trusting wholly in God, Daniel refused to yield to their influence and to practice the Devil religion. Because of his faithfulness to God, the king caused him to be cast into a den of lions; but God’s unlimited power was exercised in behalf of his servant Daniel, and the wild beasts did not touch him, but did destroy those who formed a conspiracy against the faithful servant of Jehovah. The foregoing are some of the instances which the Lord has caused to be recorded as a further assurance to his people now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•’Why did Jehovah so often show his mercy to the backsliding Israelites and so frequently restore them to him and fight their battles for them and deliver them from the enemy? Such Jehovah did for his own name’s sake. (Isa. 43:25; 48:9-11; Ezek. 20:8,9) “Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, 0 house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.” (Ezek. 36:22) From the time of Satan’s rebellion till now the great name of Jehovah is the important issue, and his purpose is to fully vindicate his name. Why did Jehovah God so often fight the battles of Israel and deliver them ? For his own name’s sake. Jehovah God will prove to all creation and compel all to know that he is the Almighty, whose name is Jehovah. He has purposed it, and he will do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; Why did Jehovah cause so many prophetic pictures to be made in times of old and a record thereof to be made and preserved in his Word? The answer is written: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) God has taken out from the nations “a people for his name”, and his time has come when those people thus taken out shall bear witness to his name. (Isa. 43:9-12) Graciously Jehovah has provided for the aid and encouragement of his people who maintain their integrity toward him, and this he does that they may have no reason to become discouraged and fainthearted. This is the time for boldness in the Lord, the time to be very courageous. God is opening to his people the meaning of his prophecies recorded of old. The time for his victory and vindication has come. Zion, of which Christ Jesus is the chief and head of God’s anointed, is “the apple of his eye”, and none can with impunity touch God’s anointed. (Deut. 32:10; Zech. 2:8; Ps. 105:15) God’s time has come to exalt his name, and Zion is his instrument to bear testimony to his name. Therefore Jehovah says: “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” —Isa. 62:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” Associated with and under the protection of Zion are those who will form the great multitude, now called “Jonadabs” (2 Ki. 10:15-23), and God has declared that to such faithful ones he will give protection. As Jehovah used his power in behalf of his covenant people of old, so now in these last days he will use his power in behalf of his anointed and those who have sought protection in his organization under Christ. Into the hand of Christ Jesus God has committed all power and has commanded him to exercise that power in behalf of those who love and faithfully serve him. Do you believe that Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and that the day of vindication is at hand? Do you believe that the conflicts in times past, when God showed his power to his covenant people, were pictures of what is now at hand and will come to pass ? Then, if so, “according to your faith be it unto you.” (Matt. 9:29) Let your eyes of understanding, now being opened by the Lord Jesus, be set entirely upon the Lord, and know that he will accomplish Jehovah’s purpose and, therefore, that it is our privilege and duty to stand firm and fear no creature. The battle is not ours, but is Jehovah’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">VICTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>ss</sup> Jehovah sent Jeremiah to prophesy against Jerusalem of its impending disaster. Jeremiah pictured Jehovah’s anointed ones now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Likewise Jehovah has sent his anointed witnesses now to proclaim to “Christendom” its impending disaster. The words which Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah now apply with greater force to Jehovah’s witnesses on earth. Within himself Jeremiah had no strength, and so stated; but, being encouraged by the Lord, he had full faith and confidence in Jehovah. Likewise the witnesses of Jehovah now on earth have no strength in themselves, but the Lord is their strength and song. To “Christendom”, which has become grossly adulterous, arrogant and blasphemous, and whose religious leaders assume to represent God and Christ, but in fact have entirely forsaken Jehovah and “burned incense” to the Devil, the Lord’s words are now applicable, to wit: “And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.” (Jer. 1:16) Men of the world insist that attention should not be publicly called to the derelictions of others. The argument generally advanced by them is, “Let us dwell in peace and not speak of trouble.” Those who obey Jehovah God cannot follow that rule, because Jehovah now says to his witnesses: “Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.” (Jer. 1:17) In obedience to this commandment Jehovah’s witnesses must go forward and tell the truth. It is not their message, but God’s message, which he commands must be delivered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>84</sup> God’s “strange work” must now be done until it is finished, and those who have made-a covenant to do his will and who then fail or refuse to perform their assigned part in his “strange work” cannot have Jehovah’s approval and blessing. (Isa. 28:21) To engage in the witness or “strange work” now necessarily brings reproach upon all who faithfully perform their duty, and such reproach is the privilege of suffering with Christ. (Phil. 1:29) Instead of shirking such duty, the faithful now greatly rejoice in being permitted to have a part in the sufferings of Christ. “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.”—Col. 1: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Those who have and exercise full faith and confidence in Jehovah and in Christ Jesus will not fear any creatures, but with boldness will proclaim the message as commanded. The remnant, accompanied by their companions, know that they must go out to meet the enemy. No longer are God’s people on the defensive, but must take the aggressive and offensive and be very courageous in performance of their duty because they know that Jehovah and Christ are bacldng them up. To them Jehovah now says: “For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city [organization], and an iron pillar and brazen walls [an irresistible and impregnable fortress] against the whole land, against the kings [political, dictatorial rulers] of Judah [who profess to praise God, having a form of godliness, but denying entirely His power], against the princes thereof [the commercial traffickers who support the dictators], against the priests thereof [the religious leaders who exhibit their gaudy garments that they may receive the plaudits of men and exalt themselves against God and his kingdom], and against the people [who support and give their allegiance to the anti-God-totalitarian-religious-Fascist combine] of the land.” (Jer. 1:18) Not only are those elements against Jehovah’s witnesses, but they act in defiance of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> The day of Armageddon is near. The combined enemy is gathered together and moving forward to carry into operation their wicked conspiracy. Behold the Fascist dictators now in the saddle and on the march, and together w<sup>T</sup>ith their commercial war lords, who manufacture munitions and guns and traffic in human blood. Riding on the back thereof and forming a part of the wicked anti-God crowd, are the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, arrogantly strutting their stuff. Does that combination speak peace to the people of God who are following and obeying “the Prince of Peace”? They do not. Our natural eyes behold only the forces and power of men, but by faith in God’s Word we see that joined together with the Fascist-religious-Godless element is a host of wicked angels and the entire wicked army is fully under the command of the Devil himself and all are bent on rule or ruin. Without full faith and confidence in the Lord the army of the enemy would strike deadly terror into the hearts of men; yet the faithful remnant and their companions do not fear. Concerning that wicked horde Jehovah speaks, and to his faithful people on earth he says: “They shall fight against thee.” We are therefore fully forewarned that the ruling powers of “Christendom”, which is antitypical Jerusalem, are maliciously making war on those who faithfully serve Jehovah God and his King. Shall any faithful servant of God now fear or be dismayed? No! Because Jehovah says to his faithful little band of servants,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“THEY SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST THEE”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>87</sup> How is it possible for a small band of witnesses to withstand the onrush of that wicked horde coming against them? The Most High, addressing his faithful servants, answers: “For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Be not dismayed at the faces and power of the enemy; and for encouragement look at the other side of the picture. Those who now love and serve Jehovah believe his Word and follow its instruction as their sure guide. To them the prophecies are now made clear, and by faith they behold a host of heavenly, glorious angels, under the command of Christ Jesus, marching to the battle of Armageddon, and they know that that invisible host shall gain the victory. The Lord is delivering to the little band of his faithful witnesses on earth, for their encouragement, this message: “[The enemy] shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” John, as set forth in The Revelation, had a vision of the approaching final conflict. There John pictured the anointed remnant now on the earth, and the vision he had is the vision of Jehovah’s remnant and also their “companions”, and concerning which it is written: “And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”—Rev. 19:11-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Christ Jesus is the head over Zion, around which Jehovah has erected an impregnable wall, and into that place of safety God, through Christ, has gathered the faithful anointed. The people of earth who are of good will toward God and his kingdom, upon hearing the kingdom message and learning of Jehovah’s gracious provisions, are hurrying to that defensed city, that they may have there complete protection until the storm of Armageddon has passed. Outside of that fortified city or organization there is no protection for anyone, and God’s announced purpose is to destroy all who are outside thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Those who think to escape the terrors and destruction of Armageddon by taking a neutral place and remaining inactive are greatly deceiving themselves. Furthermore, those who do find protection and safety under the Lord’s organization cannot wait until Armageddon begins and then seek such protection. That great conflict is a time of greatest distress upon the earth and is designated by the Lord as the winter time. Jesus gives this warning: “Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter [time].” —Matt. 24: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> Over a period of many centuries Jehovah dealt with his typical covenant people and fought their battles for them and delivered them. They were fought for his own name’s sake, because he had given his word that he would have a people for his name that would prove their integrity toward him. Now the end of Satan’s rule has come and the time for complete vindication of Jehovah’s name. It is a time of the final showdown, when the issue of supremacy shall be for ever determined. God has given his word that he will show his strength in behalf of those who have full heart devotion to him in this day. But that promise does not extend to any of his enemies, nor to those who remain indifferent and inactive toward God and his “strange work”. Each one must take a positive stand for the Lord. It is the day when the kingdom under Christ shall prevail and when the Lord will cover himself with glorious victory, and to all the words of Jesus now apply, to wit: “He that is not with me is against me.” (Matt. 12: 30) Those who find refuge now must boldly stand on the side of the Lord and fully and completely trust in him, for in him alone must the people hope.—Matt. 12: 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“Jeremiah had no personal fight with the men of Israel. He was sent as God’s messenger to proclaim the judgment of Jehovah that the people might know Jehovah’s purpose. Likewise today Jehovah’s witnesses, in fulfillment of the prophetic picture made by Jeremiah, have no fight with men on earth, but are sent as the messengers of Jehovah to declare unto the people God’s judgments already written and to inform them according to God’s Word what will be the result; and this they do to the end that those of good will toward God might be informed and flee to safety. The words of Jehovah given to Jeremiah now with stronger force apply to Jehovah’s witnesses, to wit: “I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.” Of the very things described by these words of the Lord “Christendom” is guilty, and Jehovah’s adverse judgment is written against “Christendom”, and particularly against the religious element led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That religious Hierarchy falsely and blasphemously claims to represent God on the earth. They have kept the Bible away from the people and thereby kept the people in total ignorance of Jehovah’s purpose and of his loving-kindness, as well as of his severity against those who disobey him. The judgment written against the Boman Catholic Hierarchy and like religionists means their complete undoing, because it states the following, to wit: &quot;Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”— Isa. 28:17,18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> To them and their allies Jehovah says: &quot;Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jer. 25 : 34,35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Those who are now in a covenant with Jehovah must keep this in mind: that there are many people held in bondage by the religious institutions and who are persons of sincerity, desiring righteousness. They must be warned and informed, and the Lord has laid this obligation upon his witnesses and their companions to give the warning. Those who love God and his King and kingdom will do exactly as commanded. They will not be fearful, but, on the contrary, will be fearless and have boldness in this day of judgment, making known Jehovah’s purpose.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The power of Jehovah God is without limitation. He has committed into the hand of Christ Jesus the power to execute his judgment. The enemy cannot successfully resist the Lord. Do we believe that this is true) If we do, then there can be no excuse to hesitate or to be inactive in the service of bearing testimony to the name and purpose of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> To now be fearful of the enemy means to fall into the snare of the Devil. (Prov. 29:25) To entirely trust in the Lord and prove that trust by full obedience, means deliverance and salvation. There is now no middle ground for Jehovah’s witnesses and the Lord’s “other sheep&quot;, their companions. To all such the Lord says: “According to your faith be it unto you.” For centuries past Jehovah has furnished the opportunity for men to prove their faith and integrity toward him. Now the greatest of all opportunity is offered, and all who receive the blessings of life from his gracious hand must seize upon that opportunity and perform joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The Lord is the buckler and shield of his people. We must therefore conclude that he is guiding all those who love and serve him and that such guidance includes his providing the text for the year 1939, and that the Lord is now saying to his people concerning the fight of the enemy against them: “They shall not prevail against thee.&quot; No foe can successfully fight against God and the people whom God has chosen for himself and who are blessed by his protection. To the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who now bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom, he says: “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.”—Deut. 33:26,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4T</sup> Jehovah and his King shall gain the complete victory, and those who maintain their integrity toward the Lord shall share in that victory. Be very courageous, therefore, and go out to meet the enemy; and as we go let us continue to sing the praises of the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CAPTIVITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">B</span><span class="font2">ECAUSE Job maintained his integrity toward God Jehovah “turned the captivity of Job”, whom Satan had specifically afflicted. (Job 42:10) Death is the penalty inflicted for the violation of God’s law; and therefore death cannot be said to hold anyone in captivity. (Rom. 6:23) Neither Jews nor any others are God’s captives by reason of death. “The whole world in the wicked one [Satan] is lying.” (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.}</span><span class="font2"> All the human race, therefore, has fallen captive to Satan and his organization ; and only those who have devoted themselves wholly to the Most High God and his King, Christ Jesus, have escaped, and in order to receive Jehovah’s continued favor they must ever afterward maintain their integrity toward Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sodom, Samaria and Jerusalem were the captives of the Devil’s organization, and all went down into death as such captives. The Almighty God will destroy Satan’s organization and will bring the people of those nations, with exceptions, back from that captivity. “When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them.” (Ezek. 16:53) These scriptures show that the captivity means, not death, but captivity to Satan and his organization. Through his prophet Jehovah says: “But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam.&quot; (Jer. 49:39) The religious systems falsely called “Christian” are like “silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts&quot; into captivity to Satan and his organization. (2 Tim. 3:6) Such are “taken captive by [Satan the Devil] at his will”. —2 Tim. 2:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ten tribes of Israel at Samaria went into captivity to Assyria, but this was merely the visible evidence that, having forsaken Jehovah’s typical organization, they had gone into captivity to Satan’s organization morally and religiously, and then actually became the captives of Assyria. Nor do the words of Jehovah by his prophet, “I shall bring again their captivity,” have reference to the return of the Israelites from Babylon by the order of Cyrus, because Sodom was not returned at that time. The return of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font2">must take place at the same time, according to the Scriptures. Today all the Sodomites are the dead captives of Satan. Likewise the unfaithful Israelites are the dead captives of Satan. All these captives must be brought back or returned “in the latter days”. (Jer. 49:39) This can take place after Satan’s organization is destroyed and Satan is bound, and the divine mandate to the survivors of Armageddon to “fill the earth” has been carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The bringing of the captives back will open their minds to the truth: “That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.” (Ezek. 16:54) Israel will then bear her shame, not shame before Sodom by measuring and comparing themselves with themselves, because such is not right, and God will not permit it. (2 Cor. 10:12) They bear their shame before Jehovah, the great Judge, due to the light which exposes and correctly measures the depths of all sin and wickedness and reproves it. “But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.” (Eph. 5:13) “In the day [of light] when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.” (Kom. 2:16) “[He] will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.” (1 Cor. 4:5) The Israelites will be ashamed of their wickedness before Jehovah, and those of “Christendom” will also bear their shame. The shame of both Israel and “Christendom” will be greater than that of Sodom and Samaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor does God’s Word necessarily mean that the Jews will be brought back to the land of Palestine. The prophet says: “When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.” (Ezek. 16:55) The word “estate” does not appear in the Hebrew. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser</span><span class="font2"> renders the text: “Shall return to their former state [condition].” Satan dragged them down into destruction and brought them into captivity, and the returning of them from captivity will mean their return unto a condition of conscious existence, freed from Satan’s organization, which will then have been destroyed. It would matter not whether they were brought back to Palestine or the United States. The Jews did much worse than the people of Sodom, and “Christendom” has done much worse than the Jews; and yet the people of Catholic and Protestant religious associations will be brought out of the graves, together with those of all other religions, and all will be given a knowledge of the truth for the purpose of judgment. This is all due to the fact that Christ Jesus, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man that believes and obeys and that it is the will of God that such shall first be brought to a knowledge of the truth.—Heb. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Scriptural testimony abundantly supports the conclusion that the purpose of returning them from captivity is for judgment. (John 5:29; 2 Tim. 4:1) In that judgment the Jews will have a harder time than the people of Sodom, and the people of “Christendom” will have a harder time than either the Jews or the Sodomites. This is proved by the words of Jesus: “But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.” (Matt. 11: 22-24) In the resurrection those of “Christendom” who have died as captives to Satan’s organization will find, when awakened from death, that Satan’s organization is gone, and there will be no more opportunity for spiritual fornication therewith. (Ezek. 16:58,59) In the full light of the truth they will be ashamed, except those who have been willfully wicked and who will not live again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The heathen, such as Sodom, must return, if at all, in order to learn that the name of God has been vindicated. All then must have and will have opportunity to know and obey God’s law. Then all must see that they are not deserving of everlasting life, but that what God has done for them in providing the means of everlasting life is because of his great love and for his own name’s sake. “Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, 0 house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.” — Ezek. 36:22; John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Christendom” is the most hypocritical of all organizations. “For thus saith the Lord God, I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.” (Ezek. 16:59) She has.called herself by the name of God, claiming to be in a covenant relationship with him and claiming to be the followers of Christ Jesus. She has had the clergy officiate at the crowning of all of the kings; had her rulers sworn into public office by an oath with uplifted hand, on the Bible; and has designated her clergy as 'God’s ministers’; and declares that the “higher powers . . . ordained of God” are the rulers that have controlled and rule the nations of “Christendom”; and her clergy and the principal of the flock emphasize the “fact” that these rulers of “Christendom” are ruling by divine right. In the face of all this outward show “Christendom” has despised her oath, denied God and his Word, and denied the blood of Christ that purchased the life of humankind, and has taken a course under the Devil’s leadership that has brought the greatest reproach upon the name of Jehovah God that any peoples could possibly bring upon his name. For this reason “Christendom” is hypocrisy gone to seed, and is the most reprehensible of all peoples that have ever lived under the sun, and hence, according to God’s announced judgment, will be subjected to the most severe punishment of all nations or peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH declares that he will give his glory to none besides his ‘elect servant’ class. (Isa. 42:1,8) No man takes this honor to himself; but the man must first receive the call from Jehovah, accept and respond to that call, and then prove faithful according to the measurements or requirements of Jehovah. Such a one is not anointed to the kingdom as soon as he is spirit-begotten. 11 is only after he has proved faithful up to a certain point that then he is anointed and is pictured as entering the temple of which Christ Jesus is the Head; hence the relationship or position thus pictured is closed to all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was in the year 1930 that Jehovah caused to be published in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> the clearer view of the way into “Jehovah’s Royal House”, and since then the remnant discerned clearly how “shut” a proposition God’s royal house is. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> January 15 to March 15, 1930) Only those who comply with the rules or measurements can enter and be made members thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These truths are emphasized in the prophetic vision of his sanctuary or temple given by Jehovah to his prophet Ezekiel. In that vision Ezekiel, led by an angel, saw himself making a tour of inspection of the grand approaches to the temple structure and of it itself. Having passed into and through the outer eourt, and then into the inner court, Ezekiel was brought to the east gate. “Then he [the angel] brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary [the outer gate of the sanctuary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.</span><span class="font2">)], which looketh toward the east, and it was shut.” (Ezek. 44:1) This gate is the entranceway from the outside into the outer court. The gate “which looketh toward the east” is the one that Jehovah’s glory used in entering into the temple. This gate Ezekiel saw was shut. To say the closing of this gate would indicate, as some claim, that the remnant class in the temple will never fall out is erroneous. The remnant are now in the temple, but faithfulness must be maintained unto death marking their complete change in the likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ, in order to abide there for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be sure, the ‘narrow way to life’ (Matt. 7:14) will be closed in God’s due time, but the ‘shut gate’ seen by Ezekiel does not seem to refer to the closing of the narrow way to life. Rather it seems to mean this: that since the coming of the Lord to the temple the privilege of entering into the royal house of Jehovah is seen to rest entirely with Jehovah, and with no creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reason for the shutting of this outer gate Jehovah told to Ezekiel. “Then said [Jehovah] unto me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because [Jehovah], the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.” (Ezek. 44:2) This decree Jehovah declares to him “that hath the key of David, [him] that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth”. (Rev. 3:7) Jehovah gives this honor to whomsoever he will. (Isa. 42:8; Heb. 5:4-6) It is certain that the Lord’s angels look well to the safeguarding of the entrance to the temple and carefully inspect every one who is presented at that gate. Elsewhere it is shown under what circumstances, and when, and to whom, the east inner gate is opened.—Ezek. 46:1-8,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Scriptures give abundant proof that the faithful</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">prophets of God will be given by Jehovah the honorable place of “princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16) “As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way. of the same. (Ezek. 44:3, A.R.P.) These faithful men of old will be perfect human creatures when resurrected and will be representatives on earth of the Lord, the great “Prince of life”. These men are to have a “better resurrection” than other men, and thus enter into the glory of God. In support of this conclusion Jesus said: “Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.” (Luke 13:28) “And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.” (Luke 14:15) The faithful men who are made “princes in all the earth”, sitting in the outer gate of the temple, do not detract from the glory of God that first passed through it. “He [the prince] shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.” But note that these princes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do not enter</span><span class="font2"> the inner court or step over the inner threshold of the east inner gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “prince” does not enter the “inner court”, which is a precinct of the priests. The close proximity, however, shows the close relationship that shall obtain between the royal priesthood and the faithful prophets of God who will be made princes in all the earth. The word “prince” here includes all these princes. These are given an honor that the members of the “great multitude” will not share. The princes bear this honor only because they are the earthly representatives of those to whom Jehovah gives his glory, to wit, the royal priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ezekiel is then brought into the inner court by way of the north gate. “Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of [Jehovah] filled the house of [Jehovah] ; and I fell upon my face.” (44:4) The cast gate being shut by Jehovah, Ezekiel is led from the east gate and goes north and around and enters the inner court through the north gate used by the priests. Ezekiel beholds the glory of Jehovah filling the temple and he falls down to worship. After this he sees God’s river of life, the waters of which flow forth from the temple. He hears further instructions of Jehovah from this time onward, as the record shows down to chapter forty-six, eighteenth verse. Since the remnant have discerned the ‘shut gate’ proposition they have beheld Jehovah’s glory in his temple in a far greater degree than ever before. “[Jehovah] is in his holy temple, [Jehovah’s] throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” (Ps. 11:4) “But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” —Hab. 2:20, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font2"> see also Ezekiel 10:3, 4; Isaiah 6:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The instruction given to Ezekiel begins: “And [Jehovah] said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine cars, all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of [Jehovah], and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.” (Ezek. 44:5) Judgment begins at the house 14</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) Ezekiel is told to mark well what he sees and hears. “The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.” (Prov. 20:12, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> God has graciously given both the hearing ear and the seeing eye to his faithful remnant now on earth. Ezekiel is thus made to occupy the position of a law-transmitter to God’s people like unto Moses declaring unto Israel the tabernacle pattern shown to him in the mountain. (Heb. 8:5; Ex. 25:40) God’s remnant is now being thus used. Jehovah’s commandments must now be called to the attention of his covenant people, and these commandments must be observed and kept by them. The manner of the remnant in serving God in going in and out of his temple service is very important to observe. We must get acquainted with his gates of praise and must use them as he has commanded. His organization directions must be observed and obeyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rebellious “Christendom” must be warned. “And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, 0 ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations.” (Ezek. 44:6) Therein is the “great multitude”. “Christendom” must be told that “the end of all things is at hand” and that the time for the end of their abominations has come. Let this suffice them for all time. The message of warning that the remnant has delivered to “Christendom”, and particularly that message first proclaimed July 26, 1931, was here clearly foretold. “Christendom” has committed many abominations in the name of Almighty God. “In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, because of all your abominations.” (Ezek. 44:7) The clergy have brought into what they called 'the church of Christ and of God’ those who made no pretense of consecration to do the will of God, who were not justified by the shed blood of Christ Jesus, and who then had no faith in the merit of his sacrifice. Many of these so-called “pillars in the church” of “Christendom” wholly repudiate the blood of Christ and the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clergy have had no real, honest concern about God’s house and its reputation, but have been ready to let it be polluted by bringing in those men of uncleanness, just so they could get members into their congregations for support and from whom they received collections. They have opened their arms to the big and corrupt politicians, the capitalists and the crooks, and have invited them to come in and share their delicacies, and paid them for so doing by giving them their support and full co-operation in their oppressive schemes. In the face of such abominations the clergy have broken God’s everlasting covenant by participating in the shedding of human blood, and also broken their covenant which they have claimed to have with God to do his will and his service. Assuming his name and the name of Christ, they were in at least an implied covenant to do God’s will, and such they have utterly failed to do. They must be warned, and the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses is now engaged in that very work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT HIS WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Loving greetings in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With great joy and gratitude in our hearts to Jehovah, through his dear Son, we wish to outwardly express this by writing to you, his servant, whom the great Jehovah has led in such a wonderful way to guide his people in this great witness work; and to have a share in this great work (a strange work) is the joy of our hearts. We are seven pioneers here, and very happy. The home is very comfortable and pleasant, and well managed, and is a haven of rest, even in this day of intense battle, and helps us to press the battle to the gate with greater intensity. This letter, too, should be a help for all who will to join the pioneer service while there is yet time, and for more homes to be opened up, that the dear Jonadabs may all come into the city of refuge before the great storm breaks forth. The joy of serving these dear ones is a joy known only to those who have that blessing. Those that take Jehovah at his word will find how he will sustain them. Truly dear Brother Schroeder was a gift from God and now England is fully awake and carrying high the banner of truth. “Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.”—Psalm 60: 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM A LETTER ENCLOSING SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This is the result of a four-month Jonadab study meeting, which is being attended by 20—25—28 and 30 respectively, and gradually increasing. When they were asked how many would like to subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">eight of them gladly responded Yes. Ten of them are full of zeal for the Lord and regular workers for the last two months, and the others take part in the Kingdom service as soon as they see the privilege; four of them have ordered phonographs, and one of them is inquiring for a sound equipment. It requires a little effort on our part to go two or three times and help them to come to these meetings. That is our work, especially now. The commandment of the Lord (John 21:17) applies now with greater force to the anointed ones than ever before. We had to go after every one of them to bring them to this meeting the first time, and now they come by themselves and bring new ones along with them. When the question was propounded to them whether they want to be organized as a separate unit (because they live twenty miles from here) they gladly responded Yes, and willingly gave their names for service, whose names I like to submit to the zone servant and, if it is proper, to help organize these groups of real Jonadabs as a separate unit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“WATCHTOWER” SAMPLE COPIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The usefulness of extra copies of back numbers of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch toiver</span><span class="font2"> as part of each publisher’s regular equipment is emphasized in a publisher’s experience here narrated. It serves to show the need to be always alert to display a sample copy to any person that exhibits sincere interest, even at the publisher’s first call upon such person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A lady of the house courteously refused to take the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font2"> pleading she was not in position to offer any contribution. Holding out the booklet to her, the publisher quickly rejoined that since she had greatly enjoyed reading some of the other booklets it was important for her to have this timely information and she could share in the work by making a small contribution voluntarily. At once she took the booklet, remarking as she started away: ‘Oh, I can certainly give a dime.’ She did. Then the publisher presented another booklet, saying: ‘One of your relatives or good friends will greatly appreciate receiving this information, and here’s an extra copy of the same booklet that you can use in that way.’ She gladly accepted it. Then, alert to the opportunity, the publisher followed up with a 'Ey the way, have you heard the latest record ?’ Thereupon she welcomed him onto her porch to play the recording ‘Relief’. At its end she said: ‘I certainly want to hear the Resolution also.’ That played, and just before proceeding to pack up, the publisher handed her a sample </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">remarking: ‘This sample copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> you will also enjoy. It comes to you by mail, twice each month, and the subscription is only a dollar a year.’ As he was packing up his phonograph and records she hastily glanced through the journal and said: ‘Maybe I’ll send in a subscription sometime, or perhaps you will take it now ?’ ‘Yes, your subscription can be entered right now,’ said he, and took out his pad of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription blanks and began filling in the house number and name of street while she was inside procuring the dollar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to this publisher’s observation, the particular piece of literature, whether book, booklet or magazine, actually produced by him and turned over to the householder’s hand is an essential aid to such to clearly understand what the publisher then tries to describe verbally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULT OF A REFERENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An interested man who wrote the Society was referred to its local representative, who now writes concerning him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Mr. ------ called on me and, of course, I was glad</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to have him. I arranged for a back call, and placed a Bible, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning.</span><span class="font2"> He said he would subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> next time. Also listened to the phonograph and seemed to enjoy it. Wants to attend our meetings at the hall next Sunday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSISTENCE IN BACK-CALLING REWARDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I decided to make another try for a back call. Son was home, and mother. I started [the lecture series] ‘Warning’, and in more than an hour between questions, explanations and appreciations I got in four lectures, four bound books, three booklets, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> sample, and a contribution of $1.10 with no solicitation or urging whatsoever, and a very definite invitation to re-call at ‘10:00 a.m. next Sunday’; which I assuredly did. All three heard the rest of ‘Warning’. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">They had been reading.</span><span class="font2"> With much appreciation the man said: ‘I can now understand what it is all about. I can read these books now and understand them.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MODEL STUDY HELPS TO SEE THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In another home where we have conducted a model study for some time, the father never ‘joined a church or religious organization’, but is now engaging in the witness work with the phonograph.

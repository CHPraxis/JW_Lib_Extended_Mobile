<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DRAMA OF VINDICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Jehovah God of hosts! who like thee is potent, 0 Yah? with thy tokens of faithfulness surrounding thee?” —Ps. 89:8, Rotherham Psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JEHOVAH is always and forever faithful in the I performance of his covenant and in carrying out </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> his testimonies. When Jehovah takes a creature into a covenant with him, that creature could never have cause for doubt as to Jehovah’s carrying out His part of the covenant. The man who seeks Jehovah with a pure and whole heart is blessed. He must always know that whatsoever Jehovah has promised, that He is certain to perform. Extolling the name of Jehovah the psalmist says: “Righteous art thou, 0 Lord, and upright are thy judgments. Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.” (Ps. 119:137,138) Every creature taken into a covenant with Jehovah must prove his faith and faithfulness if he would receive Jehovah’s approval. That means that the creature must be put to the test and under the test prove his integrity toward God. Those who are faithful have part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. When the crucial test is applied and the creature seems overwhelmed with the burden, he must take courage and know that, if his faith remains strong and he continues faithful, Jehovah will bring him through in safety. “For the Lord preserveth the faithfiil.” (Ps. 31:23) As God’s people near the end of their earthly journey, and just preceding Armageddon, the tests upon them increase in severity; but that is no reason to be dismayed. “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted [tested or tried] above that ye are able.” (1 Cor. 10:13) The remnant are a called people, taken out from amongst men for Jehovah’s purpose: “Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.” (1 Thess. 5:24) The Word of Jehovah repeatedly assures his covenant people of his own faithfulness; and such he records for the aid and comfort of those who love him. In the prophetic dramas recorded God has performed that which emphasizes his own faithfulness and has stressed the necessity for his people to be faithful. These are days of great peril; in these days Satan is desperately attempting to destroy those who have made a covenant to do Jehovah’s will. Therefore the people of God have need to strengthen their faith and prove their faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The trespass of Achaij had given great distress to Joshua; and this is shown by the fact that Joshua prostrated himself before the Lord and cried unto the Lord “until the eventide”. (Josh. 7:6) The entire camp of Israel was in distress and their faith put to the test. The faith of Joshua did not fail, and, when commanded by the Lord, he arose, stood up, and was diligent to obey God’s commandment to cleanse the camp. Jehovah foreknew that a time would come when spiritual Israel would be defiled by wrongdoing of some in the camp or congregation, and in his faithfulness he made a picture thereof, and now in his due time he has revealed the meaning thereof; and this he does for the aid and comfort of his people. Let no one who today truly loves and serves God be dismayed by any trials that come upon him. If faithful in the performance of our commission, we may be entirely certain that Jehovah in his faithfulness will preserve us and deliver us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Immediately following the cleansing of the camp of Israel God caused his people to make another part of the drama picturing and foretelling the vindication of his name. “And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.” (Josh. 8:1) Thus Jehovah foretold that the vicious and malicious acts of the “evil servant” class, pictured by Achan, could not succeed and will not be permitted to retard the advance or increase of His witness work, which work must be done preceding Armageddon. The wrongful acts of the “evil servant” temporarily had an adverse effect upon the people of the Lord, but that is no reason to be afraid or dismayed. Jehovah commanded Joshua to go up to Ai, and this was proof that the camp of Israel had been cleansed and his covenant people was ready for war. A call was immediately issued, not for a few thousand to engage in the war, but for “all the people of war” to prepare for and go into battle. Likewise, as set forth in the text for the year 1937, the command is given to all of the remnant and the “camp”: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” (Obadiah 1) That part of the drama recorded in Joshua the eighth chapter is another picture of what God brings to pass at Armageddon and immediately preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty. It is another picture of Armageddon, separate and distinct from that of Jericho. Joshua there played the part picturing Christ Jesus, who commands the forces of Jehovah of hosts. That part of the battle forces that was concealed in ambush against Ai pictured the invisible host of the Lord, which host does the real slaughter work. While the ambuscade was set, the other part of Israel stood before the city of Ai and enticed the enemy to attack, and thus pictured those who fearlessly carry on the witness work just preceding Armageddon, and which brings on the attack of the enemy. The following part of the eighth chapter of the book of Joshua discloses God’s purpose to destroy all those who oppose him and to completely remove the reproaches that the Devil has brought upon His name, and the drama shows the means by which He will accomplish that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Just before starting on the march to Ai Jehovah gave Joshua assurance of what would be the result of the assault upon that city of the enemy: “And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.”—Josh. 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> That the same fate was to befall Ai as that which had befallen Jericho shows that it also is a picture of Armageddon. Jericho, being the first city of Canaan to be assaulted and taken, was the first-fruits of the land unto the Lord, and the spoil thereof was to be completely destroyed. Ai being the second city of Canaan to be taken, the spoil thereof was not to be destroyed, because not devoted exclusively to Jehovah; and this is shown in the text, which says: “Only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves.” In preparation for the assault upon Ai God commanded Joshua: “Lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.” An ambush is a military term meaning that troops are concealed from view in order to make a surprise attack upon the enemy. This, prepared by Jehovah, is the first ambush recorded in history. This shows that the forces that will do the slaughter work at Armageddon are hidden or unseen by the organization of Satan on the earth for the reason that the enemy do not believe what God has recorded in his Word. It is further proof that God’s witnesses may publicly and repeatedly declare God’s purpose concerning his enemies and their testimony will not be believed by the ungodly. The forces of the Lord are so stationed in the battle of Armageddon that, when the fight begins, all avenues of escape are cut off and none can escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Ai was north and west of Jericho. Still on farther west, and somewhat to the north of Ai, was Bethel. On the north side of Ai was a valley, and on the east thereof a desert plain. No doubt Joshua had inspected the country round about Ai, and he moved his troops into position to the best advantage, as directed by the Lord: “So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.”—Josh. 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>T</sup> In the fulfillment that means a command from the Greater Joshua: “Forward! March toward Armageddon, always facing the foe and never turning back.” Joshua moved his forces by night march to locate them in strategic points. This suggests that Jehovah’s witnesses are not to disclose everything of their movements to the enemies and to thus permit the enemy to forestall their activities. Let the enemy draw their own conclusions by their distorted minds and then take whatsoever course they may choose. It appears that Joshua moved his troops in different divisions and at different hours in the night. Those forming the ambuscade were located in the hills on the west of Ai and between that city and Bethel. That division under the immediate command of Joshua, and with which he encamped, moved out also in the nighttime and took their position on the east of the city of Ai in the desert plain, and later on that night moved about to the north and pitched camp at a point where there was a valley between the Israelite troops and the city of Ai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Joshua issued his orders to each division. That division hiding on the west side of Ai received the following orders: “Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready.” (Josh. 8:4) It appears from verse twelve that there were five thousand in this division concealed in ambush; and that division seems clearly to picture the invisible part of Jehovah’s battle organization, and which division is ready under the Lord’s command to attack and do the destruction work against Satan’s visible crowd, and that at the appointed time. The further orders were issued by Joshua: “And I, and all the people, that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.” —Josh. 8: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•At the proper time that division was to appear before Ai as if to make an attack. This shows all Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth, the “remnant” and those associated with them, their “companions”, who appear before “Christendom” by going from house to house and doing the witness work, which in fact invites the attack by the enemy, and who, at the proper time and when commanded to by the Lord, perform some maneuvers that seem to the enemy like a retreat: “(For they [the conceited and boastful enemy] will come out after us,) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.” (Josh. 8:6) The fulfillment of this part of the drama may take place when the enemy forces feel fully assured that Jehovah’s witnesses are hard-pressed, and then they determine to viciously go after them and destroy Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Furthermore Joshua instructed those in the ambush that, when they saw the enemy chasing the fleeing Israelites of the other division that were with Joshua, those in ambuscade should come forth and begin the attack: “Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.” (Josh. 8:7) This shows that Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, in command of all the forces of Jehovah of hosts, is maneuvering the invisible, heavenly hosts so as to co-ordinate them with the movements of Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth. Every movement of both will be harmonious. Considering this in connection with the instructions given by the Lord at Ezekiel 9:1-7, the movement of the invisible force will begin immediately after the witness work is completed, and the invisible force will attack and destroy Satan’s visible organization. Thus it is seen that the invisible forces of the Lord take the organization of Satan and destroy it. Joshua issued further instructions to the invisible ones, or the ambuscade: “And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.” (Josh. 8:8) As to destroying the city by fire, as stated in this text, this symbolically pictures the destruction that comes upon Satan’s organization at Armageddon, and which is named by the Lord in another prophecy of Ezekiel, showing the invisible forces of the Lord attacking Satan’s organization. Also by another prophet of the Lord (Habakkuk 3:5): “Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Joshua had issued his orders to both divisions, and now the first division of the army moved out to its position: “Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.” (Josh. 8:9) The army moved by night, and this division of five thousand went to the west side of the city and were concealed from the view of the enemy. Joshua then moved the large division, containing approximately 25,000 troops, out by night, and this division was placed on the east side of the city. This larger division of Joshua’s forces pictured Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth moving into action following the general convention of 1937, when the Lord’s people throughout the earth were moved to greater activity: “And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered [inspected] the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.” —Josh. 8:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> As it appears according to the record of verse twelve, that division put in ambush contained only 5,000 men. It follows, then, that the other division must have been made up of approximately 25,000. Thus was foreshadowed all the witnesses of the Lord rising up in 1937 and marching to their positions for war. Those who were privileged to assemble at Columbus, and other thousands assembled elsewhere on the earth at that time, well remember the conditions and enthusiasm of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, moving into their position for action. The slogan on that occasion was the chosen year text, which, no doubt, was chosen by the Lord and was provided for the occasion: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” As Joshua inspected his troops early in the morning, before daylight, likewise the 1937 convention was an inspection of Jehovah’s people, the receiving by them the battle instructions, and such inspection was made by the Lord Jesus throughout the entire earth. The “elders of Israel” that accompanied Joshua were not such as the “elective”, self-important type of modern time, but those Israelite elders pictured the ones who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, and who are likewise on the alert to carry out instructions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> It appears that after the early morning inspection made by Joshua he then moved his forces from the east to the north side of the city of Ai and pitched his camp there. That was immediately across the valley from the city of Ai. “And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.” (Josh. 8:11) On the north the camp was right before the city gates and in sight of the city. The north appears to be the position, symbolically, from which Jehovah’s Executioner comes. The Israelites’ there appearing before or in sight of the city pictures what Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing since 1937 by increasing the house-to-house witness work, both inside and outside of “Christendom”. The valley between the city and the camp of Israel on the north was selected as the point from which the attack would begin, and evidently the Canaanites expected the attack to be from that point, from what afterwards came to pass. The land sloped from the north down to the bottom of the valley and then up, upon the south side or that side next to the city; and that would make it appear to the Canaanites that the attack on the city would be very difficult for Joshua by reason of his forces’ being compelled to climb up the steep embankment and attack the city walls. The ambush had already been prepared, and is described as follows: “And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.”—Josh. 8:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Thus the ambuscade was on the right side of Joshua’s main force as he faced Ai. These positions are important, and hence described in detail, and show that Jehovah maneuvers the forces before Armageddon, both his own and that of the enemy, and he puts them exactly where he would have them before the battle begins. The invisible angelic forces are the right-hand support and defense of Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth, while the earthly force work and walk in “the valley of the shadow of death”, and there the invisible forces serve as Jehovah’s protection provided and give assurance to them that no evil shall befall. (Ps. 23:4) Concerning those on the right hand, and which forces are concealed from the enemy’s view, the Lord caused to be written in his Word: “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?”—Heb. 1:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“After pitching camp on the north of the city early in the morning, and even before daylight, Joshua moved down into the valley with his troops: &quot;And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.” (Josh. 8:13) As the darkness lifted and the daylight began to appear the watchers on the walls of Ai discovered Joshua and his army in the valley in front of the city gate; and seeing Joshua there the watchmen would immediately sound the alarm. The king of Ai, no doubt, was in command of all the fighting men of Ai, and the information that the Israelites were preparing to attack the city would immediately be brought to the king’s attention: “And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.”— Josh. 8:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The quick rushing of the Canaanites to battle showed their self-confidence and their total ignorance of Jehovah’s purpose against them. They would have in mind the previous battle, when the Israelites fled. Even so the Devil and his forces are self-reliant and now ignore the warning, ignorantly, and are completely ignorant of what Jehovah will do to them. The king of Ai and his men would be flushed with the former rout of the Israelites and would be eager to rush out of the city and again defeat the attacking forces. As to the fulfillment of this part of the prophetic drama, no man could now tell how and when it will come to pass, because we can understand prophetic pictures only after they have been fulfilled. But it does plainly appear that the fulfillment is in the near future and that not yet has the time arrived for the enemy to give the signal for a general attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses. The Lord’s people, thus being forewarned, may be better prepared for the attack. When the Fascist-Roman Catholic Hierarchy - dictatorial element have fully overrun the democracies of the world, and the dictators are in complete control, then would appear to be the time when the signal is given, that is, the “time appointed” and agreed upon by the enemy when there will be a general movement by those combined elements to crush the witnesses of Jehovah. The conspiracy and overt acts performing that conspiracy are described in Psalm eighty-three and appear to fit the time here mentioned : “They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83:4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” The ones pictured that will join in this united movement against the Lord’s people include the “evil servant” class, who, together with the others, are determined to completely crush and destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. God’s people then totally relying upon him pray to the Lord as set forth in the Psalm concerning the enemy: “Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish.” (Ps. 83:17) The purpose of this prayer is that the name of Jehovah may be vindicated. As to the present movement of the enemy, while these words are being here written the enemy all over the world is preparing for an attack on the Lord’s devoted ones and the enemy’s machinery is being oiled and put in running order. Daily the enemy’s newspapers publish accounts that strongly point to the fact that religionists and their allies, the political and trafficking element, together with the “strongarm squad”, are acting together to destroy the witnesses of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The surprise appearance of Joshua and his army in the valley before Ai was a warning that the attack upon the city was imminent. Likewise today in fulfillment the enemy's visible organization and forces have been warned that Armageddon is the battle of Jehovah God, and that he will destroy all the enemy at that battle. That warning, however, is ignored by the visible representatives of the Devil. They laugh at the warning and make no provision against that which they are warned is coming, because they are ignorant of the Scriptures and have no faith in what they have read concerning them. The enemy senses an impending danger moving upon them, but they do not know what it is. They hear Jehovah’s witnesses announcing it, and they hate to hear it. They do not fear Jehovah’s witnesses, but they hate them because they sound the warning. They do not believe that Jehovah is backing up such witnesses, who are now proclaiming the message of the kingdom. The prophetic drama has been performed and fulfilled up to this point sufficiently to show that the battle of Armageddon is very near.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Concerning the position of the opposing force, those in ambush and the main army under Joshua, the description of a well-known authority on Bible history may here be properly considered and that with profit (McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia, </span><span class="font6">Volume 1, page 193):</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Joshua, encamping within sight, but with a valley intervening, when he came up to make a false attack, necessarily appeared to disadvantage, the enemy being above him, and his retreat toward his own camp rendered difficult by its being likewise above him on the other side, and both sides no doubt very steep, as they are in general in the hills of this region. His men therefore fled, as directed, not toward the north, where the camp was, but eastward, toward the plain and desert; while in the hills, not behind, but on the west side, lay the ambuscade, in sufficient force alone to vanquish the enemy. This body of Israelites had not therefore the objectionable route to take from behind the city, a movement that must have been seen from the walls, and would have given time to close the gates, if not to warn the citizens back; but, rising from the woody hills, it had the shortest distance to pass over to come down directly to the gate; and, if an accident had caused failure in the army of Joshua, the detachment could not itself be intercepted before reaching the camp of the main body; while the citizens of Ai, pursuing down hill, had little chance of returning up to the gates in time, or of being in a condition to make an effectual onset.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The hour has struck, and the battle begins. The gates of the city of Ai are flung wide open, and the entire fighting force in that city, under the command of the king, rush out and expect to quickly dispatch the Israelites. &quot;And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.”—Josh. 8:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> As Joshua’s men fled, the enemy reasoned that the Israelites would flee back toward their camp on the north, but here Joshua fooled them by immediately withdrawing all of his forces eastward into the plain or desert. That drew the army of Ai down the steep slope into the valley, away from the city gate and farther away from the position of the 5,000 men in ambush. The chase is on, and with eagerness and self-confidence the army of Ai left the city behind entirely unguarded, with the gates wide open, and rushed on after the Israelites. Up to this point in the drama Joshua had not struck a blow against the enemy. As to the fulfillment:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> It is now only a short time before Armageddon, and Jehovah’s witnesses are in the open before the enemy, with no carnal weapons and no means of striking a mortal blow, if they had such a desire, and they do not desire nor are they permitted to use carnal weapons. The situation seems clearly to indicate that the combined force of the enemy, political, judicial, legislative, commercial, military, police, propagandists and others, will make a combined attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. This may come about by restrictions being placed upon Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions; and that, from the enemy’s viewpoint, would put God’s people apparently on the run, and an effort of the enemy would then be made to completely crush those who are on the Lord’s side. The Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, the Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the Most High, will permit it to be so, that Jehovah’s witnesses apparently are on the run, and this in order to draw the enemy into the open and cause a combined assault upon those devoted to the Most High. Then would be the time when the Lord commands his force in ambush, that is, the angelic host of heaven, to go into action, and that invisible force obeys the command.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>83</sup> The king of Ai pictured Satan, and his closely associated officers would picture Gog and other wicked angels: &quot;And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.” (Josh. 8:16) Here Satan is pictured as bringing into action all his visible forces against Jehovah’s King, the kingdom message, and those who bear that message, and the attack is made with the wicked determination to wipe out completely the forces of Jehovah from the earth. Every fighting man in Ai was ordered out and went forth to engage in the battle: “And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.” —Josh. 8:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">**The town of Bethel joined also in the attack. Those of that town probably represented the religious element. All forces of the enemy were called into action to make a complete clean-up of natural Israel; thus foretelling the determination to wipe out spiritual Israel, that is to say, Jehovah’s witnesses and those who associate with them. The enemy left their city with no protection; and this shows that the enemy played into the hands of the Lord, who is wiser than any creatures. As the enemy of natural Israel at Ai relied upon their own strength, so at Armageddon the Devil and his forces rely upon their own strength. “They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.”—Jonah 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* Evidently the Lord had instructed Joshua as to the time and manner of giving the signal to the forces in ambush for them to get in action; and so now, as shown in the picture, this was the time for them to act. “And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.”—Josh. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘•Jehovah timed the maneuvers of the battle forces, and so he gave command to Joshua to stretch out his spear, and Joshua obeyed exactly at the appointed time. The sign of the glittering spear was doubtless the spearhead, and the shining of the rising sun on that spearhead would be reflected to the men in hiding on the west of the city, where those men were eagerly waiting for the signal directing them to go into action. A similar manifestation of the Lord’s power was given in another battle fought shortly thereafter at Gibeon (Josh. 10:12-14), and concerning which it is written (and which scriptures foretell Armageddon), to wit: “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.”—Hab. 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>,T</sup>In flashing his spearhead Joshua would have to turn about with his face toward the pursuing enemy; and immediately the men in ambush, seeing that flash of his spear, advanced to the attack. This part of the prophetic drama pictures the signal given by the Commander-in-Chief, Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, to the angelic host of Jehovah to attack and destroy God’S enemies: “And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.”—Josh. 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The great battle of Almighty God will grow with intensity. Fiery destruction will reduce Satan’s organization to a burnt-crisp ruin. It is the battle of the Almighty Jehovah for the vindication of his holy name, and he will wipe out the enemy. Concerning that fight it is recorded in Jehovah’s Word: “And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against his brother. And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” —Ezek. 38:18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Will any of the enemy escape the devastation resulting from the battle of the great day of God Almighty 1 Mark now what follows: “And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.”—Josh. 8:20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> At this point Joshua wheeled his army of superior numbers and began a forward attack on the approaching enemy. Naturally this astonished the enemy and the commander thereof would want to know why, and, looking back, he saw the city of Ai on fire. “Trapped!” would be the astounding cry. Likewise when the Lord Jesus begins his aggressive assault upon the enemy at Armageddon, not one of the enemy will find a way of escape. If some for a time hide themselves, they will be searched out and destroyed. By that time all the opposers of Jehovah on the earth will have donned their fighting garments of identification, and they will be easily found out and no mercy or quarter will be shown them by the fighting forces of the Lord. (2 Ki. 10:22-27) Satan’s representative, the king of Ai, and his army, looking back and seeing their city burning, seemed at this point in the drama to picture those who behold Babylon going down and who stand far off and weep and howl: “Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.” (Rev. 18:9,10) The Devil’s forces at that point will have abandoned religion and will be going exclusively after Jehovah’s faithful servants, and then will quickly meet complete defeat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> At this point in the battle Joshua’s turning back on the pursuing foe also pictures the angelic forces of heaven joining in the destructive work at Armageddon. Thus it is seen that Joshua and those under his immediate command played more than one part in the great prophetic drama at the battle of Ai.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“ Those in ambush rushed into the city and fired it. The smoke arising therefrom warned the forces on both sides that the city was doomed to destruction. “And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.” (Josh. 8:21) The king of Ai and his fighting men, picturing the Devil and his fighting element on the earth, had left behind in the city the women, and the burning of the city at this point of the drama pictures the destruction of the religious element that run to cover and let others do their fighting, and which element suffers complete destruction. (Jer. 51:30) The entire fighting army of Ai and of Bethel, that had joined them in this fight, were destroyed by Joshua’s forces upon the battlefield; and that pictured the destruction of all the elements of Satan’s visible organization, which go out to destroy the only people on earth who truly serve God and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The 5,000 men, who had been in ambush, but who had now fired the city of Ai, immediately left the city burning and hurried out to join in the slaughter of the enemy then upon the battlefield: “And the other issued out of the city against them: so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.” (Josh. 8:22) The enemy of God’s covenant people were then surrounded by the Lord’s forces under Joshua, and no one of them was permitted to escape. Here the picture speaks in thunder tones of the battle of Jehovah at Armageddon and what will be the results. Surely now seeing the revelation of this prophetic drama up to this point will cause Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions to be strong in faith, strong in courage, and hope. The combined enemy marching on the faithful servants of Almighty God to destroy them are certain to fail. To his faithful and obedient servants Jehovah now says, as he said to Jehoshaphat: “Tomorrow go ye down against them.” We now are in the “tomorrow” and are going out, facing the enemy with the message of the kingdom. The Lord then shows his people that they have no need to fight with carnal weapons, because he says to them: “Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; . . . the battle is not yours, but God’s.” (2 Chron. 20:15-17) Like Jeremiah, the faithful servants of Jehovah now on the earth go out before the enemy with the message, and as they go they know that they will meet strong opposition. They know great difficulties are before them, and for their encouragement Jehovah now says to his faithful people concerning the enemy: “They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.”—Jer. 1:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>34</sup> The revelation of these marvelous truths to God’s people at this hour of stress is proof of Jehovah’s grace and loving-kindness; and those who serve him faithfully, the true followers of Christ Jesus, now will not fear or be dismayed, but with full faith and confidence in the Lord and with real courage they will advance to the work and do so without slacking their hand or efforts. Let the faithful now be strong and very courageous. Victory is certain 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> The only creature permitted to see the complete slaughter of the last man of Ai was the king himself. There he pictured Satan the Devil, who is the last to see his forces destroyed: “And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.” (Josh. 8:23) This is exactly in harmony with Revelation 20:1, 2. The king, being brought alive to Joshua, was held for the time to see the complete finish of all his fighting men: “And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.”—Josh. 8:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> As to the fulfillment, some of the “male women”, who have been wearing skirts while collecting money on the strength of “purgatory” and other parts of their racket, may, as Armageddon starts, change their garments, that they may appear like farmers, in order to hide their identity, with the hope of escaping. (Zech. 13:4-6) But that will avail them nothing. They cannot deceive the Greater Joshua, because he will search out all of God's enemies. Those would-be ‘farmers’ will be completely wiped out: “And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.”—Josh. 8:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> The number twelve thousand mentioned in this verse evidently referred exclusively to the fighting men, and not to the non-fighters, they being not worthy to be counted. The picture shows the complete and thorough slaughter of all of God’s enemies, which form Satan’s organization. Players in a prophetic drama often picture different things at different times. All the forces of Joshua now engaged in the slaying work at this point represented all of the unseen or angelic forces fighting under the command of Christ Jesus at Armageddon. In that fight none of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth will have any part. Their part of the work is to participate in God’s “strange work”, to sing forth his praises; and since it does not appear that there was any singing after the slaughter began, this supports the conclusion that appears in other scriptures that the “strange work” will be done when the slaughter work begins. The destruction of Ai was so complete that it pictures complete extermination at Armageddon of every part of Satan’s visible organization in order that the earth may be entirely clean preparatory for the execution of the divine mandate concerning the filling of the earth.—Gen. 1:28; 9:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> The Jericho picture discloses the people of good will that form the “great multitude”, and which were shown in the saving of Rahab and those of her household. The battle of Ai makes no specific mention or picture of the “great multitude”; but, since Rahab and her household had been absorbed in the organization of Israel, the presumption must be indulged that the “great multitude” will be closely associated with the remnant at the battle of Armageddon as it progresses. This is further corroboration that the gathering of the “great multitude” must be completed before Armageddon. Other prophetic pictures show the “great multitude” in the “cities of refuge” at the time of the battle of the great day of God Almighty and that they are under the protection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that they must abide there until the battle is completed.—Num. 35:9-32; Josh. 20:1-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> It is stated in the record that, when those men of ambush had fired the city and rushed out to attack the enemy in the open field, the men of Ai “were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side”. This shows that the host of heaven, under the immediate command of Christ Jesus, will completely encompass the enemy and wipe them out. Joshua did not give a signal to stop fighting, but commanded that the fight go on; and this is shown by the fact that “Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear”. (Josh. 8:26) Jehovah had commanded Joshua to “stretch out the spear that is in thy hand”. (Verse 18) It is not specifically recorded that the continuous success of the battle over the enemy depended upon Joshua’s keeping his spear outstretched, but the presumption is that he continued to signal with that spear to go on with the battle. At Rephi-dim, where Joshua led the battle as field marshal under the superior command of Moses, fighting the Amalekites, the continued success of that battle depended upon Moses’ hands’ being upraised. (Ex. 17:8-16) Probably the continued success of the battle of Ai depended upon Joshua’s constantly signaling with his spear. At least, his outstretched spear was a sign to keep on fighting until the last man was wiped out. This seems to mean that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Field Marshal in command at Armageddon, will continue to signal his forces to continue the fight until every vestige of the Devil’s organization is completely done up. Joshua wanted to be fully obedient to the command of Jehovah of hosts and to completely exterminate the enemy regardless of how long the fight had to last. With him there would be no unfinished job, such as when, years afterwards, Saul left unfinished the commands of the Lord to exterminate the Amalekites. Had Saul profited by the experiences of Joshua he would never have spared a single one of the Amalekites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> The fight and complete slaughter of the inhabitants of Ai was not an act of fiendish and needless slaughter, as critics would have it appear. No proper appreciation of that battle of the Lord nor of Armageddon can be had until one gets an understanding of Jehovah’s purpose. The name of Jehovah is the great issue to be determined. Satan had challenged Jehovah and defied him to put on earth men that would remain true and faithful and who would thereby show the supremacy of Jehovah. The Amo-rites and other Canaanites that held possession of Palestine were entirely on the side of the Devil and were practitioners of the Devil religion, and hence the judgment of Jehovah is that all such shall be destroyed. At the great deluge of Noah’s day Jehovah had wiped out all the human race, saving only eight persons. Had men thereafter profited by that expression of God’s wrath, and the exercise of his power, they would not later have turned to Devil religion. Having done so, they are in line for destruction. In the battle of Ai Jehovah was making a prophetic picture foretelling his purpose to wipe out at Armageddon all of the Devil’s supporters. That prophetic picture is certain to be fulfilled, and now those who believe God and who love and serve him profit by the record of the battle of Ai, and hence put themselves entirely on the side of God and the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus. All such consist of the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses and the “great multitude” and are the only ones that God will permit to survive Armageddon. This information is now disclosed by the Lord for the benefit of all who desire righteousness, and who desire to continue to live. It is the great privilege and duty of those who receive an understanding of the truth and profit thereby to carry that message to other peo-pie who are of good will, that they too may seek the only place of safety. The battle of Armageddon will be entirely in favor of the Lord and result in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. With Joshua and his army at Ai Jehovah was making a dramatic picture of the vindication of his name, and which drama is certain to be fully enacted in reality in the very near future. The fight between the Lord and the Devil began in 1914; and then in 1918 Jehovah stopped that fight, thus ‘shortening those days of tribulation’, and the interim of comparative peace furnishes the opportunity for the witnesses of the Lord to go about in the earth and warn the people and serve those of good will that they may find the way of safety and salvation. That good and “strange work” is now in progress and is drawing near to an end; and when it is ended, there will immediately follow ‘great tribulation such as the world has never known, and which will be the last. (Matt. 24:7-22) That means the complete blotting out of all of Satan’s forces and the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> At the battle of Ai Jehovah invoked a rule different from that at Jericho, sparing the cattle from destruction: “Only the cattle, and the spoil of that city, Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the Lord, which he commanded Joshua.” (Josh. 8:27) According to the rule and practice announced at Numbers 31:25-31 a tribute was levied upon the prey which was to be used by the priesthood of Israel to the glory of the Lord. There will surely be a fulfillment of this part of the picture. And while we may not know just how this will come to pass, we do know that those who actively share in kingdom service against the enemy will reap durable riches, that is, treasures that will never vanish. The faithful servants of the Lord are therefore now laying up treasures that shall endure forever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> The work of Joshua discloses the approaching fate of Satan’s wicked world. “And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.” (Josh. 8:28) As to the fulfillment of this part of the drama, note Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s organization: “Behold, I am against thee, 0 destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.”—J er. 51: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> The Devil himself then receives attention: “And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.”—Josh. 8:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> The gate of the city was the place of judgment. The fate of the king of Ai, therefore, proclaims that Satan, after witnessing the total destruction of his organization, shall be executed as an accursed thing and upon his name there will remain everlasting reproach. Other scriptures show that Satan will be brought forth at the end of the thousand years; and some have very unwisely suggested the impossibility of his being brought forth, assigning the reason that there is no ransom for Satan. The ransom is not at all necessary in order for one to be brought out of death. God’s power knows no limitation. It is within his power to do as he has announced, that is, to awaken Satan at the time when the earth is filled with righteous creatures and then show Satan what a great fool he has been all the time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> Immediately after the battle of Ai Joshua proceeded to march his army about twenty miles farther north, to a historic spot. Abram, upon entering the land of Canaan, made his first stop there, the location being near the site or place of Sichem, and which is between Mount Ebal and (on the south) Mount Gerizim. At the command of Jehovah Abram entered the land of Canaan: “And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.”—Gen. 12: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Moses, transmitting God’s instructions to the Israelites before entering Canaan, had said to them: “And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gil-gal, beside the plains of Moreh?”—Deut. 11:29,30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> Thus it is seen that the locality was one of historic interest and was sacred to those who loved Jehovah. “Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal.” (Josh. 8:30) The time had come to obey God’s instruction to build an altar at the identical place where God had promised Abram, “Unto thy seed will I give this land,” and which promise had at that time begun to have a fulfillment upon the natural seed of Israel, who had just entered Canaan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Joshua was carrying out the command given by Moses: “As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.” (Josh. 8:31) This was near where Abraham built his first altar. (Gen. 12:7; Ex. 20:25; Deut. 27:5,6) With great gratitude to Jehovah for the fulfillment to Abraham’s natural seed, and for giving them the victory over their foes, Joshua there offered sacrifice upon that altar. Now Jehovah’s faithful remnant, the spiritual seed of Abraham, God’s anointed children, are in the &quot;land of promise”. They are “living stones” placed in the temple. (1 Pet. 2:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font6">Now they ‘offer sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to Jehovah by Christ Jesus, even the fruit of their lips’, by faithfully proclaiming the name of the Most High and his kingdom. Jehovah has already given the “remnant” victory in his kingdom country, and with the “great multitude” they thank him and praise his holy name.—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Joshua did not write a message on the altar stone, but upon stones prepared and plastered over for that purpose: “And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.” (Josh. 8:32) The stones upon which he wrote were prepared in obedience to the command received by him through Moses: “And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister; and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou may-est go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee. Therefore it shall be, when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.” “And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.” —Deut. 27:2-4,8.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> This act magnified Jehovah’s law and stressed the importance thereof, and the record made thereof was a testimony to all coming that way, and that could not be ignored, and none could plead ignorance of the law and the covenant of Jehovah. “It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.” (Isa. 42:21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font6">His law is his Word, and by it Jehovah vindicates his name. Since the spiritual Israelites have crossed the antitypical Jordan, and particularly since 1936, Jehovah has caused his law to be magnified against religion and its tradition; showing that his law is honorable. Religion transgresses and nullifies God’s Word or law. (Matt. 15:1-9) The booklet entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection,</span><span class="font6"> published by the Society in 1937, specifically calls attention to this, and which testimony furnishes a warning to those who practice religion, that they may have no excuse to plead ignorance in justification of their action in practicing religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> Now behold the company of people that hear the blessings and the curses the law of God has set forth: “And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the stranger as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.”—Josh. 8:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> All the Israelites were there. It seems certain that Rahab and her household were there, as they could not have been safe elsewhere. The father-inlaw of Moses and his descendants had come along on the journey, and hence those “children of the Kenite”, the forefather of Jonadab, was there. (Judg. 1:16; 1 Chron. 2:55) The “mixed multitude” that came out of Egypt with Israel was there. (Ex. 12:38,39) All of such were there, seeking protection by remaining with the covenant people of God. If those “strangers” wanted a share in the privilege and protection of the Lord they must subject themselves to the one law of God. (Ex. 12:48,49; Num. 9:14,15; 15:14-16) It was therefore vital for them to learn of God’s law and what the requirements are. Those strangers pictured the “great multitude”, who today must learn God’s righteous law, the same as the anointed are required to do, and they must be anxious and willing to learn. Such is the means of seeking righteousness and meekness. (Zeph. 2:1-3) The place of assembly was about in the heart of the land of promise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>83</sup> Now note the fulfillment, at least in part, of this part of the drama: Jehovah’s witnesses are now within the mountains of God’s kingdom under the immediate command of the King, the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus. They are assembled at the temple to learn the law of God. The 1937 convention at Columbus was a marked expression of this. The remnant stood in the Lord’s presence to hear and rehearse the blessings and the curses of the law of God. The prophetic truths, which Jehovah caused to be published in 1937, emphasize these things. Particularly, here note the articles “Understanding” (published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font6"> of May 15.1937) and “The Kingdom Interests” (published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> December 15, 1937), as well as the warning messages in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> of that year entitled “His ‘Work’ and His ‘Act’”. The remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs, walking together, have together learned the law and the testimony of God from that time onward.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> The blessings were read from Mount Gerizim, on the south, and the curses were read from Mount Ebal, on the north, according to the assignment of the Lord. (Deut. 27:11-13) “And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.” (Josh. 8:34) Thus all the Israelites and the “strangers” were duly forewarned and were responsible from that time on; foreshadowing that the remnant and the people of good will who will form the “great multitude” are warned and are responsible for the outcome of the course taken by such.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>M</sup> The message of the Lord was not censored for fear of offending the religious susceptibilities of anyone, nor for any other reason: “There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.”—Josh. 8:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>M</sup> The faithfulness of Joshua was shown by careful attention to every word of the text of God’s law. All the people were required to remain still and listen. Even the “little ones”, that is the “tripping”, little children, were there with the grownups, and all were required to listen, whether they could understand or not. That was an important occasion. Even so now, the Lord brings to the attention of the people through the Watch Tower publications his message of warning and instructions, to the end that all who love God and his kingdom may be instructed in that which is necessary that they may escape the curse and may receive the blessings of the Lord. The faithful grownups are seeing to it that this information and knowledge is transmitted to their children. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> April 15, May 1, 1938.) The people of good will are being helped to understand by those faithful witnesses who call back upon them and help them to get a start in the study of God’s Word. Many readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">will call to mind that large number of “strangers” who stood up at the 1937 convention, thus forcefully illustrating to many that those of good will today are walking and working with the anointed “remnant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; This marvelous drama, which Jehovah caused his covenant people to enact long ago, was recorded in the Bible for the learning and comfort of his people now on the earth. (Rom. 15:4) Those who are now hearing and appreciating the Word of God know full well that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is near. The Devil also knows it, and he is desperately attempting to plunge the entire race into destruction. He is applying the whip of affliction on God’s people, causing some of them at least much distress. He is gathering all of his forces under the immediate command of Gog to engage in the final conflict. While this copy is being prepared the evidence is hourly piling up proving beyond all doubt that the dictator element under Satan’s command is assembling for the final conflict. Stalin, who is the representative of Communism; Mussolini, the representative of Fascism; and Hitler, the representative of Nazism, are all traveling the same road and are all anti-God and anti-Kingdom. They place the state above Jehovah God, and for the time being they accept the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Devil’s chief religious representative, as their spiritual guide. Even the hated and persecuted Jew, under the Devil’s cruel lash, is bowing to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, being apparently entirely ignorant of the history of the persecution of that people. The entire combine is the fruit of Satan’s work. The liberties of the people are about gone, and the woes that weigh them down are daily increasing; and some are learning the reason why, to wit, as it is written: &quot;Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>58</sup> Whether they know it or not, the leaders of Communism, Fascism, Nazism, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are all under the command of the Devil, bent on the destruction of God’s people that they might defeat Jehovah and his King. Standing there against all of this ungodly and cruel horde of Satan are those forming the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, and their companions, the people of good will, and who are proclaiming the warning to the people; and for that reason these are the objects of Satan’s attack. (Rev. 12:17) All of Satan’s force are marching to the open attack of Jehovah’s faithful people on earth. But let no one on the side of Jehovah and his King be dismayed. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Joshua, is in command, and the King of Eternity says to his faithful witnesses : ‘The enemy shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee. Be of strong courage.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>69</sup> For the encouragement of his people Jehovah is disclosing his truths to them at this time. Appropriately the dramas of vindication considered in these seven </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> articles lead up to the great and dramatic battle of Gibeon, as foretold in the book of Joshua, chapters nine and ten, and which heretofore have been considered, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">of 1936, pages 245-251, 259-267, 275-282, which God’s people may again study with profit. Note this for a certainty: that the time for the battle of the great day of God Almighty is nigh at hand and that Christ Jesus, the Commander-in-Chief, leading that battle, will gain complete victory, to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ON EARTH AFTER ARMAGEDDON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE PEOPLE want peace; but the prediction is freely made that when another war is declared they will respond because they are commanded to do so and are put in fear and jeopardy by the governments if they fail to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">War engenders hatred. One of the great benefits the people will have under the righteous theocratic government of Christ Jesus is that he will stop all war and plant love in their hearts. Lasting peace will be the result, and this the people of good will shall for ever enjoy who shall survive that final, universal war, the battle of Armageddon, now near. Nineteen centuries ago the angelic host proclaimed this message of gladness in the hearing of the shepherd witnesses : “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of good-will.” (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> This definitely settles the matter that those who will enjoy “his government and peace” are the people of good will toward God. All such must and will believe Jehovah is the Almighty God, Christ is the King, and his kingdom is man’s hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through his prophet (Isa. 2:2-4) Jehovah foretells the establishment of his righteous government, exalting it above all the earthly governments which must pass away in Armageddon, and he declares that unto it the people of good will of “all nations” shall flow: “And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain [symbolic of the government] of the Lord, to the house [temple] of the God of Jacob [Israel] ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths [of righteousness] ; for out of Zion [God’s capital organization] shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [the New Jerusalem]. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning his King, whom Jehovah, in A.D. 1914, placed upon the throne to rule the world, it is written (Isa. 9:6, 7): “The government shall be upon his shoulder” ; he is “the Prince of Peace”; and “of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end”. That will mean to the people of earth universal peace. The horrors of war will be gone for ever, and there will never be another war. When people of good will learn and understand this truth they sing for joy.—See Psalm 97:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The animals of the mountains and of the forest are at enmity with man. They try to kill man, and man kills them. Under the Lord’s righteous government peace shall for ever be established between even the wild beasts and man. God, of course, knows the language of the animals and of the fowls of the air, and he will speak to them in their own language and quiet their fear of man, and peace will be for ever established between the wild beasts and man. The prophecy of Hosea 2:18, concerning spiritual Israel, also refleets man’s future state on earth under the government of Him who says: “And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow, and the sword, ami the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.” Concerning his righteous government and its peacefulness it is written of Christ the King: “And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [government] : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isa. 11: 5-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the present unsatisfactory governments the people in general do not feel secure in their property, in their limbs, or in their lives. Totalitarian, dictatorial rule obtains in many lands, yet in some lands the people go through the form of electing their representatives to the various departments of government, but these are overreached by the selfish interests. Such conditions, however, will not be possible under God’s government, because that government will be a righteous one and all the people shall have an equal show. There will be no rich and no poor. The haughty will have been brought down from their exalted positions and the poor and meek will be lifted up, that all may have an equal and common standing before the great, just and righteous Judge. A man will be secure in his home and in his property. Then men will build houses and live in them as their own. They will not build for another to take it away from them. (Read Isaiah 65: 22.) The oppressor and extortioner will not be permitted then to operate. The conditions will be favorable and equitable and everyone will have a fair opportunity. Under the righteous government of the great Theocrat man will not fear. “But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”—Mic. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Earth,” as used in the Scriptures, symbolically represents the visible organization of mankind under God’s kingdom. Psalm 85:11 says of that time: “Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.” God made the literal earth for man. (See Isaiah 45:12,18.) God put the electricity in the earth and around the earth for the benefit of the people of good will. The power that is in the waves of the sea belongs to Jehovah, for “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof”. (Ps. 24:1) The power of the ocean waves will operate the great machines that may be invented, and will produce the electricity that will light all the homes, provide the heat for all the homes as well as generate the power for all the necessary machines in the homes and upon the farms. No one will be permitted to reap a selfish profit therefrom, because none will be permitted to oppress or hurt in all that holy kingdom.—Isa. 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the wealth and all the power in the hand of the Righteous Ruler will be used for the general welfare. Then there will be no heavy burdens laid upon anyone, and no men and women seeking employment that they might earn their bread. The theocratic government will carry on a great reconstruction work for the general welfare. He will restore the waste lands and make the places that once were desolate blossom like the rose and bring forth in abundance. The people will feel secure in their property, in their lives, and in their liberties; and all will learn to do right. Isaiah 65:23 tells us, “They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble.” They will all enjoy the fruits of their work. Thorns and thistles have long encumbered the ground and made it difficult for man to obtain a good yield from the soil. The Lord will show man how to remove these hindrances, that his crops may be raised in abundance. Famine has been one of the great enemies of man under Satan’s rule over man. There will be no famines when Jehovah’s government under Christ is in full sway in the earth. Psalm 67: 6 foretells: “Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conditions will be entirely different when the Righteous One has full sway and exercises it. Then the people will have plenty and will rejoice. As stated at Proverbs 29:2: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” With the production and distribution of food and raiment carried on in justice and righteousness the people will be contented and happy. Isaiah 25:6 announces: “And in this mountain [government] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, ... of fat things full of marrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The health of the people is of very great importance. If all the people could have health, that would be a great benefit to them. The present governments take some steps to safeguard the health of the public, but in so doing the people are exploited. Many who claim to serve the sick connive at making even the well sick that they may be able to reap pecuniary gain therefrom. Foods are adulterated to sueh an extent that much sickness results therefrom. However, under the Lord’s righteous government the people will be taught what is proper to eat and howto eat it; they will be taught proper sanitary conditions, how to sleep and exercise, and no one will be permitted to deceive them. They will be told the truth; and, knowing that they are receiving the truth, they will be encouraged and benefited and will progress rapidly. God will cure the sick that they may remain well, and, according to Isaiah 33:24, “the inhabitant shall not [any more] say, I am sick.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the enemies from which man has long suffered are fraud, deception, exploitation, extortion, robbery, war, and religion. Man has suffered at the hands of grafters, oppressors and religionists. He has suffered because of famine, pestilence, sickness and death. All these enemies God will destroy through Christ by his “strange act” at Armageddon and by the operation of his righteous government. Of Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, it is written (1 Cor. 15:25,26): “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sorrow and pain shall pass away, and “there shall be no more death”. (See Revelation 21:4-6.) The people will learn that God in his loving-kindness has bestowed all these benefits upon them. The faithful and obedient will have strength and health and life in their perfection. They will stand upon the earth in the image and likeness of their great Creator, and their prayers of thanksgiving will ever ascend unto Him through Christ Jesus. They will delight themselves in the Lord Jehovah God and express their heart’s sentiments to him.—Psalm 145:1-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A CENSORED LETTER FROM WAR-TORN BARCELONA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“My dear Sirs: It is just a month, that I received at the same and duly time the books and your letter. I cannot tell with your language my thanks, and it is a great pleasure for me to be able to congratulate you for the favor, that I cannot pay today with money. I have 17 years and at this young age I have had the fortune to know the God’s Word, and the truth of this near Kingdom. Perhaps, after this cruel war, I shall can give you my thanks personally. In the interim meanwhile, receive many blessings, and the assurances of my friendship for you.” (Dec. 1,1938)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHE HAD READ THE SAMPLE “WATCHTOWER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A lady had accepted a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Upon calling back a week later she was able to intelligently discuss the article. We now have a Model Study in her home; her husband is as much interested as she is, he being formerly a Catholic. The children, one girl age twelve and another age eight, sit in on the Model Study and take part therein; and the family is now taking </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">The man told me last week: ‘My wife studies </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> all the time and she arranges to give the children a daily lesson from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and assigns them paragraphs to read out of it.’ It is joyful to observe how this entire family is doing as the Lord commands: ‘Seek righteousness, seek meekness.’ The fact that the children offer intelligent comments during the study shows they are progressing too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Sunday, January 15, while witnessing in Ventnor City, N. J., I witnessed to a very bigoted Roman Catholic family. The name is Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sterling, 201 N. New Haven Ave. Ten minutes after my departure, a police officer accosted me and took me to City Hall. At first the officer said I was not under airest, but after telling him I had an important message of God’s kingdom and that I must continue on my way, he then said I was under arrest. When brought before Judge Bruno, without my having spoken a single word he arose and shook hands with me, making this statement to me: ‘Be assured that you are not under arrest.’ He asked for my name and address and what I was doing for a living during the week. After stating to him my secular employment, he then asked what I did on Sundays. I told him I preach the gospel of God’s kingdom, going from house to house. He then said: ‘It is a pleasure to meet people of your type, and there should be more like you.’ Prior to my leaving he wished me good luck. I then asked him for the name and address of the complainant, whose name appears above.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“DOORSTEP METHOD” IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By the Lord’s grace, have more than made the quota on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, having a total number of 21 to date. I’m hoping to bring up the number of booklets placed during the remainder of the campaign. The doorstep method with the phonograph seems very appropriate and this method had been employed here last summer; but found it difficult in cold weather to get the people to stand and listen. However, now that it is getting warmer, now and then, I have good success in giving an effective witness in that manner. To illustrate: On Monday, February 27, the doorstep method was employed eight hours. Results were as follows: 21 setups, 35 sound attendance, 28 booklets placed and contributions amounting to $.33. Seldom is the time available to engage in the service a full day, due to the many back-calls which make it necessary to spend practically every afternoon in going back to those of good will, and naturally this brings down the number of books and booklets placed. I attempted to get my 200 hours [as a pioneer] during the month in spite of the car breaking down and being sick one afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CATHOLIC ACTION FIGHTS FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was at 5 o’clock, three hours before the recorded lecture ‘Fascism or Freedom’, that the manager of the theater called and said: ‘I can’t let you have the theater for that lecture tonight.’ I went down to him and soon found out who was protesting. The Hierarchy, working through prominent citizens, had been calling in protest after protest. I outlined to the manager the responsibility that rested upon him, showed him the Hierarchy had lied to him and misrepresented the lecture to have him break the agreement to rent us the theater. It took him a long time to decide, but the weight of threats of boycott, etc., was too heavy. He said: ‘Here is your money, and if you will bring me a bill of your advertising expense, I’ll be glad to pay for that too.’ There is a small hall in Grand Island [Nebr.] that is always available for Jehovah’s witnesses, regardless of opposition, but we figured it was too small. It was all we could get on such short notice, so we engaged it. We had a large sign made telling what had happened, mounted it on a stick and paraded it back and forth in front of the theater. At the curb were six cars ready to take people to the other meeting place. It was interesting to heai<sup>1</sup> some of their expressions when they found out what had happened. Still the Hierarchy wasn’t satisfied. They sent three thugs up to cause a disturbance at the new meeting place; but since the police force are not under Hierarchy control, we soon had a cop there, and when the men found we had police protection they went away. We had good attendance under the circumstances, all accepted free </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> booklets, and almost all contributed toward printing more as they left the hall. March 2 was set for the second lecture to be given in Grand Island. Before any advertising was done for that lecture the company servant there was found along the side of the road north of Grand Island, unconscious and all cut and bruised up. He doesn’t remember ever leaving town or anything about what happened. Another brother, who works for a grocery store, went to collect a bill from the fellow who painted our signs, and the fellow hit him and broke his nose. ... We may have to call in the [kingdom publishers of the] whole zone to finish the job there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOW PREFERS BUSINESS TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One brother, very timid in this part of the work and having usually worked in the rurals, came out and tried it for the first time last December. Now he would rather work the business than the rurals. He obtained many back-calls, and placed quite a few bound books with the business people. In reaching the managers of many of the leading finns he uses the City Directory.”</span></p>

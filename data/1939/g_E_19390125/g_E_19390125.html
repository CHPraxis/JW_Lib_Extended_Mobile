<p><span class="font15">Jesuitized Albion. &nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">(In </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Parts—Part</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE French police, when seeking to solve a particularly puzzling crime, proceed upon the assumption that there is somewhere, somehow, a woman involved, and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">if they can locate the woman they will be able to solve the mystery. Hence the phrase, &quot;Find the woman,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In international affairs, where the various factors that enter into a given situation are particularly mystifying, the presumption that somewhere in the background there is a Jesuit, or Jesuit influence, will often lead to surprising discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The influence of the Jesuit organization in the Roman Catholic system has long been recognized. The head of the Jesuit order is often referred to as the &quot;Black Pope”. In his book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">While Peter Sleeps,</span><span class="font9"> E. Boyd Barrett, an exJesuit, shows how the Black Pope can and does dictate to the regular pope, who is, by way of distinction, referred to as the &quot;White Pope”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The influence of the Jesuit system in England cannot be doubted, although its workings are hidden from the public eye. But straws show the way the wind is blowing in Albion. It is further in order to utilize these straws to find some solution to the “Munich Plot” which has so perplexed the observer of international trends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the outset it is of interest to reveal the Jesuit in the Cliveden woodpile, than which it is difficult to find a more imposing and voluminous woodpile in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Cliveden Set</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Considered one of the most influential groups in Britain, the Cliveden set is suspected of being pro-Nafi and of having forced favors to Hitler at the expense of Britain. The Cliveden set practically controls the British press. The set includes Lord Lothian, educated in a Jesuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 29, 1939 </span><span class="font9">school, but ostensibly converted to Christian Science. He makes frequent visits to Hitler. Lord Londonderry, another member of the set, is a close friend of Goering. Major John Jaeob Astor, owner of the London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9"> Geoffrey Dawson, its editor, and Barrington Ward, assistant editor, Sir Neville Ilefidcrson, ambassador to Berlin, Montagu Norman, head of the Bank of England, and Lord Halifax, the Foreign minister, are also identified with the set. Lady Astor, formerly Nancy Langhorne of Greenwood, Va., entertains the Cliveden set at her home every week-end, and it is there that most of their planning and plotting is done. Sir Stafford Cripps, of the Labor party, referring to the Cliveden set, stated, “People do not fancy the future of this country as does the gang of Lady Astor, as being that of a junior partner in a Fascist Internationale.” Lord and Lady Astor both deny that there is such a thing as the Cliveden set. That, however, is not significant. The Jesuits, and their pupils and sympathizers, are adepts at plain and fancy subterfuges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prosperity, as well as adversity, makes strange bedfellows, and the Jesuits are pleased to co-operate with anyone who will further their schemes for world-domination. One may be a “Christian Scientist” or &quot;Anglo-Catholic” or what have you. That is of secondary consequence. The main requirement is a certain pliability and agreeableness with an eye to the main chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “Fuehrer” ‘Principle'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> has suggested that “the ‘Fuehrer’ principle (dictator idea) can exist within the framework of Parliamentary institutions”. That is just another way of telling England they will have a dictator one of these days. Chamberlain’s sympathies are undoubtedly in that .direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">। i^_t -w His trip to Berchtesgaden is be-l^^A^jlieved to have been planned long ago by the folks that meet at the home of Lord and Lady Astor, al- — ii~W ready referred to. With reference to this, Robert Briffault, British scientist and author, in an address at St. Louis, remarked: Chamberlain’s spectacular flights to Germany .for conferences with Hitler were not the result of a sudden inspiration! It is known in diplomatic circles that the trips were planned weeks in advance and that an airplane was held in readiness for the prime minister. As a matter of fact, the first suggestion was that the king himself should ,go see Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The war tension that followed was terrific, but never once did the government heads expect to fight. The fear instilled in the people was deliberately planned. There were elaborate measures taken for protection from air raids, bomb shelters were dug in Hyde Park and sand was sprinkled in attics to prevent damage, in some unexplained manner, from Incendiary bombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whole thing was planned to make the peace with the Fascist powers seem more sweet. It is strange how little people understand diplomacy and how greatly they can become stirred by war.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Peace of Munich</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By no means all Britishers arc satisfied with the “peace” that was won at Munich, The “appeasement” of Hitler seems to many to have been gained at the sacrifice of honor and principle. A few illustrations of the reaction of these are here given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Manchester </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font9"> of September 23, observed editorially:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Mr. Chamberlain now reads his papers he will see no trace of admiration tor his part as the head of a great democracy, no trust that he can save any shred of principle from the wreck, no belief even that he can recover his country's honor. England and France have known some humiliations in the last few yeans, but none so great, as this. Our name is mud in the United States and in the Dominions; the smaller European States have thrown up al! faith in the saving of the European order and are scrambling to declare their neutrality or to seek safety in agreement with Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A statement by Messrs. Rcedman, Guenault, Sumner and Davis, of the University of Wit-watersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, appearing in the October 14 issue of the same, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' There is more than a suspicion that the war scare was partly artificial and was used to avert the gaze of the democratic peoples from the. fundamental issues while the one remaining liberal State in Central Europe was reduced to impotence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We do not believe that even at Munich the alternative to giving Hitler his full demands was war. Mr. Chamberlain went to Munich with two very good cards in his hand—the fear of war even in Germany (out of which Mr. Chamberlain made mueh political capital) and the unreadiness of the German High Command to lose another world war. Yet Mr. Chamberlain deliberately threw those two cards away. It is doubtful whether any group of politicians in history have had such a pernicious influence on European politics as the present so-called hitler British Cabinet. Each has been concerned with major events in recent years which have brought shame on the people of Britain: Sir John Simon and Manchuria, Sir Samuel Hoare and Abyssinia, Lord Halifax and Austria, and now Mr. Neville Chamberlain and Czechoslovakia. They have so long forsaken any guiding moral principle that they are apparently incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The tears which Duff Cooper, First Lord of the Admiralty, shed in the House of Commons when he learned'of the ignominious peace dictated by Hitler at'Munich were not crocodile tears. He honestly believed that Britain’s surrender to Germany means the end of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is an odd circumstance that on the eve of the meeting of the four men at Munich to carve up Czechoslovakia the so-called,‘eternal light’ burning over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe, Paris, flickered and went out, and remained extinguished until the return of the premier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Behind the Scenes</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ladislas Fara go, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ken,</span><span class="font9"> November 3 (1938) issue, adduces reasons why he thinks that the September war scare was artificial, stating: that the Munich four-power conference was arranged in the private office of Montagu Norman, head of the Bank of England, four years before it occurred (and names those present); that in 1934 English armament firms placed huge advertisements in German papers offering for sale tanks and guns prohibited by the Versailles treaty; that Chamberlain has 833 shares of preferred stock in Imperial Chemical Industries, and 5,414 shares of ordinary stoek, while his son is on the sales staff at the main office in Birmingham; that in June, 1937, Norman had laid out the plan that Hitler was to annex Austria and dismember Czechoslovakia, with the subsequent return to Germany of some of her colonies;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">that Blum’s government was overturned because he would not go along with this ultraFascist program, and, finally, that Runciman, , who was sent to Prague to becloud the issues, was himself the man who in 1934 authorized the first export of aero engines to Germany in open violation of the Versailles treaty. The article thus lays bare the fact that Britain is really Fascist, and indicates that Hitler has all along been staging theatricals for propaganda purposes, well knowing that he had nothing whatever to fear from the British Government, which takes its orders from the head of the Bank of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Further unfavorable reactions to the Chamberlain “appeasement” policy, so unpopular among liberty-loving Britishers, are registered abroad, particularly in the United States. Some of these follow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>the Pressure</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen say interestingly, in the Philadelphia </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Record, </span><span class="font9">British bankers had bet money on the demise of Czechoslovakia by advancing money to German industrialists, who in turn were working with certain big Czech hankers. These</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Democracy goes to Munich</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Czech bankers put the pressure on Benes, the British put the pressure on Chamberlain, and Hitler put .the pressure on both. The British bankers won. ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Heywood Broun’s observations in the October issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Arbitrator</span><span class="font9"> are even more arresting</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I think that in the next general election Neville Chamberlain should describe to the voters the nature of the day which might impel him to say “Enough is enough”. The suggestion is offered that while he might candidly admit that circumstances might make it necessary to cede England, Scotland and Wales for the s^ke of peace, he purposes to argue that London should remain as a free city in a canton setup. And if Hitler will not agree to that Sir Neville should insist on retaining the upper </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 25, 1839 </span><span class="font9">floor of 10 Downing Street as a private apartment so that there may be some spot which shall be forever. England. It’s a long way to Tipperary and a short hop to Berchtesgaden. Geneva is no more. The World Court is out of the picture and the League is dead. Instead there stands Adolph Hitler’s summer cottage, and to it the democratic leaders may go by appointment to ascertain the will and pleasure of Der Fuehrer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The opinion of the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram’s</span><span class="font9"> special correspondent, John T. Flynn, is equally incisive. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If anyone in this country now has the hardihood to raise his voice in support of the proposition that we should go to war to save the democracy of England, I assume that the proposal would be greeted with a horse laugh. What is at stake in England is not democracy, but her economic empire. What she is interested in protecting is that economic empire—those vast possessions which are, in fact, merely markets for her. What England saw threatened by a war was that empire. What she wants us to help her protect is that empire. To protect it she has destroyed the last home of republican government east of the Rhine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■An ex-soldier, in the Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font9"> of October 8, lamented as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everything we thought we were fighting for in</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the great war, freedom, justice, international honor and democracy, have been thrown on the junk pile. Czechoslovakia follows Ethiopia and China into bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Spain, short of sending British troops to assist the rebels, Mr. Chamberlain has done everything he possibly could to ensure a victory for Franco. He calls all this a policy of “appeasement”. To a good many people it looks more like the policy of making the world safe for Fascism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A bitter paragraph appearing in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds </span><span class="font9">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font9"> of October 16 indicates how the Jesuit tactics of the Fascists are driving men to sympathy with Communism, accepting what to them seems to be less odious than hypocritical religion, and failing to see that God’s way is neither that of the religionists nor that of the Communist. The latter, in the estimation of such perplexed minds, appears to manifest qualities of candor and consistency which the Pharisaical religious systems lack. The item follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Russia has no aims menacing to Great Britain, breathes no' fire against Democracy anywhere. Under the gangster code of morals now governing international relations, there is no reason why Ministers of the Crown should be polite to her. And Russia has been guilty of two unforgivable crimes. She has succeeded in creating a form of Socialist economy over one-sixth of the globe; and while “democrat:c” stateBmen have been tearing up treaties and breaking their bonds, she has stood firm by her solemn obligations and the principle of Col-<sub>t </sub>lective Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many Britishers see clearly that the trend of British politics, so adroitly played, is in the direction of Fascist-Nazism and away from the democratic traditions and policies of the last few centuries. Nor are they blind to the fact that the tools of the Roman Hierarchy everywhere contribute their efforts to that end.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark34">1</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a speech in London U. S. Ambassador Kennedy showed his Roman Catholic training by saying it has long been a theory of his that dictator and democratic countries should get along together without emphasizing their differences and that there is no sense in letting these differences grow into unrelenting antagonisms. In other words, in his heart Kennedy is for Fascism and, as such, is not a fit man to represent a democratic country. He knows that Fascism hates and detests democracy; if he were on his job as a representative of America he would let the whole world know that America hates and detests Fascism even more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Britain’s national debt as of March 31,1938, was £8,026,143,422, the same being the largest in its history. The public debt of the United States, as of June 30,1938, was also the largest in its history, standing at $37,165,000,000, or about $2,294,226,963 less than Britain’s. The population of Britain is only about one-third that of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">United </span><span class="font9">States; so the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">per capita </span><span class="font9">debt there </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">^is </span><span class="font9">much greater. Recent </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">rearma</span><span class="font9">ment expenditures, in the greatest, maddest armament race in history, caused tremendous increases in both debts, but especially Britain’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">nation that is financially ham-V®\ a' stringed is not likely to be in posi- . tion to evade the toils of a system that has the experience and financial resources possessed by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ro</span><span class="font9">man Hierarchy. That system appears to have made extraordinary progress during the period of the world’s perplexity. Aided and supported (or, let us say, aided and abetted) by the unscrupulous Jesuit organization, the Roman Hierarchy 'has an evil advantage that even the great British Empire appears powerless to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The author, G. T. Garratt, in his </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Mussolini’s Roman Empire,</span><span class="font9"> at page 240, remarks apprehensively :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On most subjects the average Englishman is prepared to recognize the complete authority of the priest over his flock. Many, including the writer, would have sen ted any attempt to penalize Catholic orders in the manner that has occurred in France, and have looked upon the existence of Catholics in England as lending a variety and interest to our national life. During the last two</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">years they have found repeated cause to modify this view. If the priest comes down to the Marketplace as a politician, and from inexperience shows himself more reckless and bigoted than the ordinary laypian in public life, then common sense revolts at treating him as a privileged person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the pope takes sides on political questions </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font9">which many Englishmen feel deeply—as, for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">example, </span><span class="font9">Italian aggression in Ethiopia and Spain —then again the English Protestant feels justified in examining the reasons which may have caused him to take this attitude, and will refuse to recognize such political pronouncements as being </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedra</span><span class="font9"> statements which any of his fallow countrymen should accept without question. If they accept as unquestionable, declarations condoning repeated breaches of treaties, of international law, , and of the ordinary rules of civilized warfare, then tile non-Catholie Englishman is entitled to ask whether Catholics any more than Communists are fit persons to be entrusted with the charge of English interests abroad. We find, on examination, that a large proportion of the Foreign Office are drawn from wealthy Catholic families, and that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">general atmosphere is extremely friendly to Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Their [number of] supporters in each political camp gives them a voice in Parliament far greater than their numbers would justify. They have at their command immense wealth, for the Church </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font9">age-long experience in accumulating property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the lukewarm Protestants are also beginning to wake up, but they will have to protest a good deal more loudly, and with a better understanding of the Scriptures, before they merit “persecution for righteousness’ sake”, as do Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">John P. Maequeen, London, appears to be cutting his eyeteeth. In an address at the Synod of the Free Presbyterian Church at Inverness, Scotland, he observed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Press and the reporters are largely under the control of the Jesuits. In 1912 between 70 and 80 percent of the editors and newspaper reporters of Britain were not only Roman Catholic, but Irish Roman Catholics; and if they were that in 1912, what must they be now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">John’s clerical brethren, however, <sup>seem</sup> b<sup>e</sup> slipping in the opposite JBbL direction, and John will do well to protest so loudly that they will excommunicate him — and he will stand a good chance of ‘laying up treasure in*heaven”. Prayers for the dead, the eastward posture in prayer, and crosses are now to be found in various churches of what was once Presbyterian Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Others, too, are becoming suspicious of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY SB, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesuitical manner in which Rome is gaining ground in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Broadcasting Control</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sir John Reith, former director general of the British Broadcasting Company, resigned his £7,000-per-year job with that company to take a £10,000 job as chairman of Imperial Airways. His deputy, when he left the Broadcasting Company, was C. G, Graves, a Roman Catholic, and probably is his successor. The Protestant papers of Britain were filled with terror at this situation, the Protestant Reformation Society saying in its annual report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Protestants have viewed with increasing alarm the increasing interpenetration of the British Broad- -easting Corporation by Roman Catholic influences in such key positions as deputy director and editor of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Radio Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh, and moct when their fear coineth. (Psalm 2:4; Proverbs 1:26) When Jehovah’s witnesses tried to tell them these things in advance they were only scorned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The American ambassador to London, who seems to be somewhat confused as to what are his duties as the representative of the American people at the Court of St. James’s, is lending a band. Said ambassador, Joseph P. Kennedy, whose sympathies with totalitarianism have already been referred to, at the behest of the British government, interposed in the production of a moving picture relating to the German-Czech crisis. He says all he did was to communicate with “a member of the Hays organization”. The name of the member is not mentioned, but since Jos. 1. Breen is a member of the Hays organization as welt as a subject of the Hierarchy, and since he is the main censor of moving pictures in the United States, mention of the name is not necessary. Suffice it to say that the picture was 'properly censored’ and Americans saw only what the Jesuitized section of Britain wanted them to see. Talk about Jesuit efficiency. Breen does the censoring, the &quot;Hays organization” is &quot;credited”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These two instances are examples of the manner in which the Jesuits indirectly have sufficient control of radio and movies to further their ends. All that seems to be needful is a watchful eye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Censorship of the Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The press still plays an important part in the business of keeping the public informed, '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">, and its prestige has been only slightly lessened by the advent of the movies and the radio. Hence censorship of the press is a vital matter with the Jesuits and their Fascist-Naai buddies. Note the following examples, observing that the Jesuit method does not always attain its ends at one bound. Sometimes those who should be subject to its demands appear to be working at cross purposes. But that outward appearance also serves a purpose. It confuses the public and covers the tracks of the conspirators against liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Alfred Noyes, English poet and biographer, became a Roman Catholic eleven years ago, and three years ago published a life of Voltaire, widely praised at the time</span></p>

Noyes got mad; and who can blame him ? He objects that the Italians who are trying to run his conscience and boss him around like a child give him no explanation of their condemnation and no date when they will explain their course, so he has sought another publisher and gone on wdth his book. The type of “freedom of the press” which Rome (and therefore the Jesuits) favors appears to have been defined by De Valera, prime minister of Eire (formerly a part of the British Empire) when he recommended “modified freedom of the press”. This “modified freedom” would, of course, mean no freedom at all; for everyth ing would be censored in advance; and don’t think for a minute the een-. sor would escape Jesuit control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Blasphemy Bill</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T. E. Harvey, Independent, English Universities, is hereby awarded the title of “Free Speech Harvey” for his courageous and intelligent resistance to the so-called “Blasphemy Aet” before the British House of Commons in the summer of 1938. He reminded the members that Christ was for free speech, He was against the attempt to root out the tares from among the wheat; he told them that the early Christians were regarded as enemies of mankind, and having, in the actual language of ■ the proposed act, “activities calculated to interfere with the established religious institutions of the country?’ He reminded his hearers that truth is its own best weapon and he did not think the House of Commons added any to its glory the day when, 300 years ago, a Puritan House condemned a Quaker for blasphemy, branded his forehead and bored his tongue ■with a red-hot iron. lie wished that the British House of Commons should stand by the principles of John Milton: “Give me the liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely according to conscience.” His address was roundly applauded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Glasgow </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Observer </span><span class="font9">reported joint Catholic approval of the bill which Mr. Harvey so effectively opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In due time it could be called blasphemy to refer to facts such as the following: In the first four months of 1938 there were no fewer than 37 crooked clergymen under the surveillance of the London police. They make most of their money by swindling women, collecting money for bogus missions of one kind or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Concessions to Rome</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pope, for the first time since</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the fifteenth century, has a personal representative in England who </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">VXjgjFl </span><span class="font9">has direct access to tfie foreign of-fee, <sub>a</sub> definite concession already largely Catholic. The new so-called “Apostolic Delegate” is Monsignor William Godfrey, formerly rector of the English College in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sending of an “apostolic delegate” to a country not having diplomatic relations with the Vatican may be considered by some to be a piece of Papal effrontery. It is a little of that, and also somewhat of a deception. Actually an apostolic delegate has nothing to do with the country to which he is sent, but is merely a representative from the pope to the Catholic church in that country. Undoubtedly the delegate makes use of his position to do what he can toward influencing political developments so as to be favorable to the Hierarchy. This business of sending delegates and diplomatic representatives is an aping of earthly governments, at which monkey-business the Hierarchy has always been an adept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The presence of an apostolic delegate also serves to put a check on ecclesiastical personages inclined to exercise a Little'too much liberty. Hinsley may need a little supervision, as his approval of Noyes’ book indicates.</span></p>

Went there many evenings, placing over 200 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All went well until in my own driveway three weeks later. I put on lectures for about fifteen guests, when up came motorcycle cops (I was already all through with the lectures). They said, “You can’t do this.” I asked why. They said, “You had it too loud.” I asked, “Did you hear it?” They said no, but had a complaint.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Asked who made the complaint, they said they did not know, but it was a white house six doors down. And you can guess who lived there —“the Christian preacher.” I told </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">cops what the mayor had said, and the chief. They asked if I had it in writing; and if not, I’d better have it, so they would not have to take me in. This was on Sunday afternoon. So on Monday, at 8 a.m., I was in the mayor’s office, waiting till 9 a.m. to see him. I told him what had happened. He said, “I guess you’d better bring this before the city council meeting on Thursday. So I did; and after explaining the work to the council the mayor made a motion that this work be continued, preaching the Gospel by sound car, and not be hindered. The streets commissioner seconded the motion (as I had also gone to him before and he took </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font9"> when I wa^ working in the business district; he said his wife spent the holiday reading it). Motion carried—only one objection ; guess his religion. So the Devil’s bluff did not work; and here we are out every day and evening with the sound ear, and with marvelous experiences— too many to relate, but we thought you would like to know a city ordinance against sound cars does not stop the message by sound car in some places.—Martha Holmes, Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For Free Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Repercussions of Judge Rutherford’s address “Fascism or Freedom”, broadcast by radio station WBBR on October 2, have been plentiful and varied. Letters received by the radio office have been numerous, with opinions forcefully expressed pro and con. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font9">here reproduces one of these letters, chosen</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 25, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">as most representative of the American ideology of freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">203 E. 14th Street New York City ‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oct. 2, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Radio station WBBR Brooklyn, New York. Gentlemen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I wish to congratulate you for the broadcasting of the Watchtower program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Altho I do not believe in Jehovah or any one of the other gods offered to us by the hundreds of existing religions, I do believe in freedom of creeds; freedom of thought; freedom of speech; freedom of the press; freedom of the radio; freedom of assembly and freedom of self-determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have noticed from personal observation that the Catholic Hierarchy in the E.E.U.U. is carrying on today the most vicious campaign against all the above rights guaranteed to all our citizens irrespective of creed, color or religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unfortunately it is tru^ that the Catholic Church in America is bending all efforts to mix itself in national politics and is making perilous inroads into the educational institutions and is trying to establish in America the same old policy of uniting the church and the state, which has proved a thousand times to be against the best interest of the state and of the people as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only by chance I heard this program, and I like it so much that I’m going to buy a brand-new radio so as to have better reception next time your program is on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I extend my congratulations to the courageous citizen who spoke from the Watchtower program. Please send me a copy of his address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[Signed] </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joseph</span><span class="font9"> V. </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rogers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Limitation of space prohibits the publication of other equally interesting expressions from citizens who still recognize their American rights of free speech and believe in them.</span></p><img src="g_E_19390125_files/g_E_19390125-9.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:89pt;">

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">N EUROPE the dictators barefacedly glory in the removal of fundamental rights of freedom of speech, press and worship. They have been so .bold and so brazen in their denial of the people’s liberties that it has aroused a spirit of revulsion and protest throughout the entire United States. In America it is not popular to publicly expound a belief in the destruction of freedom of speech or press. The big business representatives and the prominent religionists all publicly state their devotion to the liberties of the people, but their actions are quite different from their public utterances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The National Broadcasting Company likes to glorify itself and parade before the people as an organization upholding the fundamental principles of freedom of the air. Its president, Lenox Riley Lohr, went to Buffalo recently and delivered an address before an outfit designated the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. He expounded to them some excellent and beautiful phrases on freedom of the air, telling them the policy of the National Broadcasting Company is to give the greatest .freedom even for controversial subjects. The following paragraphs are quoted from Press reports of his address:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Freedom of the air does not give every citizen the right to express his opinion over the radio— there are not hours enough in the day to allow that. It is a freedom to broadcast a eentroversial subject. By controversial subject I mean that on which a substantial group of citizens—large in number and important in influence—has a different opinion from another substantial group of citizens, and on the outcome of their discussion a third substantial group would be affected. The Supreme Court reorganization plan was such a subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is NBC’s policy. On any controversial subject we will give equal opportunity without charge to both sides to express their attitude before the public. There must be speakers of equal consequence, equal in number, speaking at equally desirable times on an equal number of stations. Of course, that cannot be achieved absolutely. But that is the standard, and we try to follow it as closely as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NBC Embarrassed with Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the meantime, however, sonife interesting letters were being sent back and forth between A. L. Ashby, vice-president and general counsel of the National Broadcasting Company, and Judge Rutherford. This correspondence proves the action and policy of the NBC toward Judge Rutherford’s lectures and the Watch Tower programs to be vastly different from the public utterances of the corporation’s president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For many years the company has declined to broadcast Judge Rutherford’s lectures. The public reason given by them is that the lectures are controversial and that Judge Rutherford “attacks other religions”. The real reason, however, is different. The fact is that the foreign power known as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has taken upon itself to censor apd interdict Judge Rutherford’s lectures. Hierarchy subjects have brought pres- • sure and have intimated to the broadcasting corporation that if it does present such lectures, even though they be true, it would be just too bad for the corporation: it would lose Catholic trade and suffer greatly financially.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several times during the past few months Mr. Sidney Weiss of the Acorn Agency applied to us on your behalf to sell time to broadcast your religious speeches or to take the programs on a sustaining basis. You cannot be unaware of the reasons we gave for declining to. broadcast those, programs, yet in your letter of-October 31st you ask why we refuse to broadcast what you characterized as truths about certain religious and political organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We repeat what undoubtedly you already know. The National Broadcasting Company does not sell</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">time to anyone to discuss religious matters and it will not permit its facilities to-be used upon any basis to attack or reflect upon any religious faith </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">pr </span><span class="font9">denomination.

Concretely applied, this means </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font9">our facilities are not open to others to attack your religious philosophies or principles and by the same token they are not available to you to attack religious organizations with which you are not in sympathy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A. L. Ashby, Vice President RCA Building, Radio City New York,’N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is to acknowledge yours of the 16th. You entirely sidestep the issue, Mr, Weiss of the Acorn Agency made application for your facilities for me to address the public on the subject of “Fascism or Freedom”, There was nothing religious about it. You state that your facilities are “not open to others to attack your religious philosophies or principles”. Permit me to say, my dear sir, that I have no religious philosophies or principles. I am not a religionist. I am a Christian who bases his conclusions entirely upon the Word of Almighty God. As to my speech on “Fascism or Freedom”, it’ set forth the indisputable evidence that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operated ■ from Vatican City and which is inimical to the American principles of government, is carrying forward a campaign in America to turn the nation over to the Fascists, You decline to permit the people to have these truths broadcast. That is not religious, but it is an organization acting under a religious name to accomplish a wrongful political purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Will you be so kind, my dear sir, as to answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Are the facilities of the National Broadcasting Company, Ine., open to use for the purpose of informing the American people against an enemy of American principles, regardless of the name of the enemy!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Does the fact tjiat an organization operates under a religious name afford for such an organization a complete shield from being exposed by your facilities as to action that is against the fundamental principles of the American government!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Is it your purpose to shield and protect any and all organizations by denying the use of your facilities to expose them, which organizations operate under a religious name and cloak!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">December 5, 1938 Mr. J. F. Rutherford, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have patiently endeavored to fully and fairly acquaint you and your representatives with our broadcasting policies. Tn view of this, you have all the information necessary to answer the questions contained in your letter of November 26th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Faithfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[Signed] A. L, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ashby,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Ashby Stands Mute</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would seem that any person having due regard for his honor and integrity, and having any consideration for American principles of liberty, would have been glad to answer the questions propounded by Judge Rutherford. But the officers of the National Broadcasting Company readily see that these questions are too ticklish for them to handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Take, for instance, question No. 1, which is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Are the facilities of the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., open to use for the purpose of informing the American people against an enemy of American principles, regardless of the name of the enemy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In line with the public utterance of President Lohr, this question ought to be answered “Yes”. But a “Yes” answer comes into conflict with their concealed policy of subservience to the Catholic Hierarchy’s dictum. To comply with the Hierarchy’s demands they would have to answer “No”, and that would be exceedingly embarrassing because it would expose their cringing to the demands of an enemy of American principles. Of course, it would not -do for them to publicly admit that an organization operating under a religious name is completely shielded by them from exposure as to action against fundamental principles of the American form of government. Therefore, in line with their public policy, it would be necessary f»r them to answer question No. 2 “Np”. But this would likewise involve them in conflict with the organization operating under a religious name and to which they have prostrated themselves. It wouldn’t do to answer it “Yes”, and they are afraid to answer it “No”. Therefore they become as one blind and dumb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same reasoning applies to questions No. 3 and No. 4. It would not do to admit that organizations operating under a religious name are immune from public exposure through their facilities. They cannot publicly admit that it is their purpose to shield and protect such organizations through denial of NBC broadcasting facilities. At the same time they dare not publicly state that NBC facilities are open to expose such organizations operating under a religious naqie and cloak. The Hierarchy says “No, no”, and the NBC obsequiously complies with the Hierarchy’s bidding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus you have the picture of the National Broadcasting Company, On the'outside it appears pure and undefiled. Its public utterances hold it forth as one loyal to American principles of freedom. Its actual policy, however,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">National Broadcasting Comvavy, Inc.</span></p><img src="g_E_19390125_files/g_E_19390125-10.png" alt="" style="width:195pt;height:39pt;">
<p><span class="font9">is that of toadyish flunkyism to the greatest enemy of the eri can people. It acknowledges money as its god and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as its censor, dictator and boss.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reflections on Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The contribution just preceding covers al! the ground, and covers it well, but a few reflections on the art of public hypocrisy, now one of the greatest and most shameless industries or occupations of earth, may be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In previous generations it was considered unfortunate if a man in public life showed no evidences of manhood, no ability to face the facts, no courage. But those days have largely passed, and things in trousers parade as men that their forefathers would be ashamed to own as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A case in Germany comes to mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prior to the Munich triumph of German arrogance, the Protestant (Confessional) churches of Germany had agreed to offer the following public prayer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lord God, we confess our sins and the sins of our people before Thee. May God forgive us and avert His wrath. But if, according to His inscrutable decision, He punish us with war, we shall seek comfort .in His promise of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To be sure, that is a silly prayer, because</span></p>

Him the author of wars and all other he devilment afflicting mankind; hut it was not because of this that the Nazi Government objected to it. Three bishops, Mahrarens, Wurm and Meiser, were dragged before the Nazi minister of Church Affairs and were told that the proposed prayer was treason to the German state; and they were saps enough, and cowards enough, to sign a declaration against the prayer, under threat of being confined in a concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But America need not boast. Manhood in the United States is down to the German level; and that means that in this country, too, are many in high positions that are beneath contempt.

<p><span class="font9">Many of the readers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> suspected long ago that the management of the National Broadcasting Company is hypocritical, cowardly and unfair, and is, at heart, a traitor to American interests. So, because it is a matter of interest, readers will be amused to see the cuts shown herewith. Compare the signature to the letter of November 16 with the one to that of December 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those three German bishops, Mahrarens, Wurm and Meiser, should haste to chuck their jobs, and get out of Germany if they can, and while they can, and should apply to the National Broadcasting Company for jobs.

<p><span class="font9">Humans that betray their parents, friends and benefactors could learn something from the Birmingham, Alabama, dog that, when the house caught fire during the night, deserted her six puppies, then only three weeks old, that she might arouse the household and so bring about the rescue of the two boys and one girl of the home that are her constant companions. As a result of her faithfulness all hands were rescued, including the six puppies. Once is a great while, in this world, something works out all right.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Soul’</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font9">URING the year (1938) the Indian Science Congress held its assembly at Calcutta. In that Congress a professor of Edinburgh University made this statement: “Nothing in brain surgery supports the religious belief that the soul [some invisible something] leaves the body at the moment of death.” That statement is absolutely true, and undoubtedly many scientists will say that the professor mentioned and other scientists are entitled to credit for this “wonderful* discovery”. It is one of the weaknesses of man to attribute to human wisdom that which belongs alone to the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Had the scientists accepted and believed the Bible to be the Word of Jehovah God they would have reached that conclusion long ago, that the soul does not leave the body at death. Had the religionists believed the Bible they would never have advanced the theory that the soul is some invisible thing that leaves the body at the moment of death. When men rejy upon human wisdom they always get themselves into trouble. Jehovah God provided the Bible for the instruction of man in the right and true way. In the Bible is the plain statement that man is a soul and does not possess a soul separate from the body. The organism, or body, together with the breath that living creatures breathe constitutes the soul. The breath of life is taken into the lungs and sets in motion the circulation of the blood, and the heart sends the blood throughout the body and sustains life; as it is written: “The I ife of the flesh is in the blood.” (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:11) The manner of producing a soul is plainly stated by the Lord in His Word, as follows: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) The soul is the creature that moves and breathes, and through the arteries and veins of that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 25. 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">soul the blood courses, keeping the creature alive. If the breath is taken away the circulation of the blood stops and the soul is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every living breathing creature is a soul. Therefore the word “soul” is not confined merely to man. The Word of God declares that every beast of the field is a soul. (Numbers 31: 28) Furthermore, it is written that a soul eats food. God said to his people, “No soul of you shall eat blood.” (Leviticus 17:12) “Whosoever eateth [blood] shall be cut off.” (Leviticus 17:14) Thus it is seen that the word “soul” and man are synonymous terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God caused one of His prophets to write, “The spirit [invisible power] of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.” (Job 33:4) It is God who created man and gave him life, thus making man a soul, and when that soul or man deliberately sins the penalty prescribed by Jehovah is death, as it is written: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ?”—Psalm 89:48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many centuries ago the great liar of the universe, Satan, the Devil, declared, “There is no death,’ and this he did in order to contradict God and reproach His name and deny His Word. Then Satan brought in religion for the purpose of mocking God, and Satan induced the religious teachers to announce that the soul is immortal and eannot die, which is also a flat contradiction of God’s Word. Religionists fell into Satan’s snare, and hence for centuries have taught the people that the soul is some invisible thing that exists and is separate from the body and leaves the body at death. Now the scientists discover that the . religionists are wrong. For many centuries Jehovah God has been telling all who desire to know the truth that the religionists are wrong and have been led into the wrong way by the influence of the Devil. Thus it is seen that religion is a snare which Satan has set in which to catch men and hold them away from God; and God plainly told the Israelites that religion would constitute a snare for them. (Deuteronomy 7:16, 25) What the people need to do is to shun religion and devote themselves to the careful study of the Bible and follow its teachings. Doing so, they will be free from error and will avoid many pitfalls. The only true wisdom concerning man is to be found in the Bible.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Reply to Ananias</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font10"> AM advised that the Junior College at Iola, Kansas, at an assembly in the latter part of November, 1938, to which high-school students were invited, was addressed by a Catholic clergyman who calls himself “Father Ai eken”. It is presumed the purpose of the assembly was to aid young American students. The clergyman delivered himself of a diatribe which clearly puts him in the class named by Jesus in John 8: 44 when He said of clergymen of His day, “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.&quot; Personally, this modern Ananias is of no importance, but his attempt to fill young Americans with numerous lies to their injury and to the injury of other people warrants a reply, He took occasion to attack me personally without any reason whatsoever, and not one of his accusations, except my place of birth, is true. The people are not interested in my personal career, but they are interested in the work in which I have been engaged for more than a quarter of a century, namely, proclaiming to them God’s Word of truth, particularly concerning His king-<sub>1 </sub>dom, which is the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The afore-mentioned Aicken denounced me as a Communist, well knowing that his statement was ■without a semblance of truth. In all my books, which are in the hands of the people to upward of 270,000,000 copies and in 78 different languages, there is not one wrnrd to be found in support of Communism. I am not a politician, I am a Christian. His attack on my career as a lawyer is vi-<sub>t </sub>cions and without a semblance of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I dare say that my record as a lawyer is cleaner than his record as a pretended preacher of the gospel. He charges that I permitted my mother to die in the county poorhouse, and to this hundreds of people w’ho knew her personally wmuld testify that such is a vicious and malicious lie. She was never inside of a poorhouse at any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. He charges that I interfered with the army and navy and -for that was sent to prison, which is also a fie. Briefly the facts are these: Together with others I was proclaiming the truth concerning God’s kingdom and the truth exposed particularly the nefarious work of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. A number of such clergymen held a conference at Philadelphia and formed a conspiracy to have me railroaded into prison. Together with others I was arrested and put through a mock trial during the excitement of the war, sentenced to eighty years in prison, and, by the political Catholic judge, denied bail. My ease was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, where bail was quickly granted. The ease was heard on appeal in the Appellate Court, the Court reversed the judgment, and the Government voluntarily dismissed the case. My incarceration was wholly unlawful and the result of a wicked conspiracy of the clergy. On being released I went to every large city in the United States, advertised the facts and exposed the clergymen, and not one of them has had the courage to answer. Their only response is malicious abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aicken charges that I *am very wealthy, grown so by bookselling. I have never sold a single book that I wrote. I have copyrighted the same and then turned them over to the publishers without money compensation, the only consideration being that they be furnished to people at the least possible expense of publication. I have devoted more than a quarter of a century to serving the Lord by proclaiming the gospel of His kingdom, and that without money consideration. I do not own a foot of real estate on earth, and at my death will have no estate whatsoever to administer, as I have none now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It comes with poor grace for any Catholic priest or clergyman to attempt to instruct </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">young </span><span class="font9">Americans on what constitutes true Americanism. The entire history of the Papacy </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is one </span><span class="font9">unbroken record against democracy and in favor of totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What has<sub>t</sub> called forth the enmity of the Catholic press throughout the earth is the fact </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that I </span><span class="font9">have exposed the conspiracy of the Vatican at Rome, with Mussolini and Hitler, to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">grab </span><span class="font9">control </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the nations of the earth, including the United States, and rule them by dictators. Before an audience of twenty-five thousand persons in Australia I delivered an address for more than an hour on the subject “Warning”, in which this conspiracy by the Fascists and the Papacy was exposed. In keeping with their record for untruthfulness the Catholic press reported that I was booed away </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">left in anger. There has not been an as</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sembly in </span><span class="font9">Australia that gave closer attention to any speech than the one above mentioned. The speech was recorded and has been reproduced by thousands of records all over the world; which proves again that the priest resorted to willful and deliberate falsehood. My speech at Seattle, Washington, again exposed this conspiracy, calling forth the anger of the anti-American Fascists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That speech on “Violence” and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font9">on “Warning” are in booklet form, and speak 'for themselves. The booklet can be had by writing the publishers, The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">at 117 </span><span class="font9">Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font9">September 11 my speech at London, England, on “Face the Facts” again brought forth </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font9">abundance of evidence proving the conspiracy of Vatican City and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in general to destroy the democracies of the world and to rule the people in an arbitrary, dictatorial manner. That speech from London was transmitted by wire </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">wireless to practically the entire earth </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">is recorded and is now being reproduced by thousands of records throughout the earth. On October 2, before a large audience at </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mecca </span><span class="font9">Temple in New York, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">spoke on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">subject </span><span class="font9">“Fascism or Freedom”, which was broadcast throughout the United States by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">chain of radio stations. In that speech the indisputable evidence was submitted proving the conspiracy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to destroy freedom in America, That speech was also recorded for reproduction, and speaks for itself. These speeches and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY S3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1938 </span><span class="font9">books which I have written exposing the nefarious conduct of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is against freedom of speech, freedom of action and freedom of worship, Have greatly enraged the Hierarchy, and they, having no defense, have resorted to personal abuse and malicious vilification. They show that they are hard pressed, by going into the public schools, which the Catholics have always been against, and there trying to poiSbn the minds of young people. They are obeying the Fascist pope in so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">will be pleased to furnish to every one of the students of the college and the high school, upon request, the booklets </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Warning, Cure, Uncovered,</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Protection,</span><span class="font9"> all of which conclusively support what I have stated here above, that the Catholic clergy, of which Aieken is a sample, resort to deliberate falsehoods to hide the nefarious scheme of the Hierarchy while it pushes on to destroy American liberty and grab control of the American Government. The Roman Hierarchy is the worst enemy America has over had. It has always been against the public schools, against the Bill of Rights, against the Constitution of the United States, and it puts the Roman Catholic system above the state and above the Lord himself. As a sample of the attitude of the Hierarchy towards the American government, note the following excerpt from an encyclical letter written by Pope Leo XIII:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“It would be very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the type of the most desirable status of the church, or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for state and church to be, as in America, dissevered and divorced. . . . Catholicity . . . would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My advice to all Christians who love liberty and who love righteousness is to avoid the Roman Catholic clergy generally, and the Hierarchy entirely, as a vicious and deadly enemy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Pope and Emperor vs. Martin Luther</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">T IS quite evident that neither the Englishspeaking peoples nor those of the other great nations of the world, in their present attitude of non resistance to Catholic aggressions, foolishly following the so-called “good neighbor policy’' are familiar with the history <sup>1 </sup>of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its record of international crime. Many people manifest astonishment when told that Nazi, Fascist and even Communist leaders are in combine with the pope, and that their dire work is merely a continuation of the Hierarchical Inquisition. Judging from the hireling press, whiih is doing the Hierarchy’s work of befuddling the people, one would sometimes think that Roman Catholicism was a rare flower to be protected from all criticism or else like some useful plant it would wither and die. Instead it is, as the Scriptures describe it, a crooked vine of the earth to 'be harvested by the sword of destruction, a disease that has ravaged every nation of Europe. It, is as ridiculous to adopt a policy of shielding such a predatory organization as it would be to nourish a leper colony simply because the disease was well-nigh extinct. If these are harsh words, the proof will hereby be submitted that only harsh words fit the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In previous biographies the foul iniquities of the Papacy have been exposed, which reached monstrous peaks of infamy under Mary the First of England, Catharine de Medici in France, and Thomas Torquemada, Inquisitor General during the rule of Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why Luther Fought Catholicism</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The struggle in Germany at about this time, that is, the early part of the sixteenth century, took the form of a struggle by Pope Leo X and subsequent popes, aided by Emperor Charles the Spanish Catholic ruler of Germany, against Martin Luther and the Reformists. That Germany too was under the foul dominion of vice in the form of the Roman Catholic church is evidenced by a few quotations to follow, descriptive of the times. Speaking of the Germany of 1483, the year of Luther’s birth, one chronicler writes that one of the chief causes of disunion was that in addition to the independent cities “the great spiritual states answerable only to the pope opposed all interests but their Wn<sup>1</sup>’. (Elsie Singmaster’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Martin Luther,</span><span class="font9"> page 3) Aipong the people in the wonderful forests and farmland of Germany there was much oppressive -taxation and poverty. “The forests might abound in game, but the peasant was not allowed to hunt; the streams be filled with fish, but he dared not cast a line. ... In this country the Jews were judged^to be the cause of the horrible ‘Black .Death’, which probably destroyed one-fourth of the inhabitants of Europe in the fourteenth century. As in France and other countries, so in Germany, Jews were tortured and murdered by the thousands [at the instigation of the Hierarchy] because the terrified and ignorant populace held them responsible for this calamity.” —Elsie Singmaster’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Martin Luther,</span><span class="font9"> page 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The acceptance of the pope as the Vicar of Christ . . . not only made men slaves, but bred dangerous confusion in the minds which saw a human [creature], fallible, sometimes even immoral and basely corrupt, in a position so lofty and powerful. The seven sacraments . . . [ot the Catholic Church] became the instruments of an almost unendurable tyranny. The doctrine of transubstantiation gave rise to sensual and gross ideas of a holy mystery. Celibacy of the clergy [priests] . . . resulted harmfully, not only in the reproach ■which it cast upon married life, but in the evils arising from the suppression of the natural affections of the human heart. . . . The Bible was a sealed book. . . . Not only did the indulgences [which were bought from the Catholic Church] cover the sins of the past but those of the future.” — Same authority, pages 6 and 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In all parts of Christendom there were signs of an approaching revolt. ,In England Wycliffe, The morning star of the Reformation,’ translated the entire Bible in the English tongue. . . . When his doctrines reached Bohemia, John Huss, who received them and began to spread them abroad, was burned at the stake. . . . Jerome of Prague met a similar fate and many others were cruelly persecuted and slain. In Italy Savonarola, an</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">earnest preacher of righteousness who pleaded for a reform within the [Catholic] church, was executed and his body burned. In the south of France the Albigenses paid with their lives for doubting the infallibility of the pope.”—Page 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With such a prelude we return now to the life of Luther, and his struggles. He early entered a monastery. “Among the tasks which Luther was first assigned as a novitiate were the sweeping and cleaning of the convent and, most humiliating of all, that of begging.” (Page 26) How the Hierarchy are steeped in the love of lucre!</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390125_files/g_E_19390125-19.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:234pt;">
<p><span class="font9">Down the hatch, as they say in America—eh, Adolf?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">In his early years of abnegation and self-torture Luther had much time for study and observance of the iniquities of the Roman Catholic Hier-<sup>1 </sup>archy. Luther especially abominated the buying of indulgences of which the abovequoted chronicler states: “So enormous a sum had this traffic brought into the treasury of Rome that its extension was authorized in all portions of the church.” (Page 43) In his 95 theses he also abominated the fact that the Roman Catholic Church, &quot;when charged with violating the Scriptures, objected that no one might interpret the Scriptures but the pope”. (Page 63) Luther spoke of the avaricious representatives of the pope, whether priest or cardinal, who lived upon a populace ruined by taxation as 'ravenous wolves in sheep’s clothing<sup>5</sup>.—Page 66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bloodshed in the Name of Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here is no brief for Luther nor for Lutheranism. Luther-himself never escaped from religion. Certainly the followers of any man or traditions of 'men are, by the word’s definition, religionists. But it is here pointed out to those who fail to see the significance of Hitler’s popish persecutions in Germany that the pope himself is attempting to regain what was lost by his followers in the battle against Luther. As will be pointed out later, the fight made by Luther against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy became a great schism, which the Papal authorities strove in vain to prevent, but the leopard never changes its spots, nor does the Hierarchy ever forget lost ground. Note the comments of a modern commentator as to how accurately Herr Hitler, in the same Germany which Martin Luther partially freed, is following the precepts, bulls and manifestoes of the habitual Inquisition against all those who differ with them, but particularly against the Jews and others of wealth. In locating the motive behind any action of the Hierarchy, always carefully examine the possibility of accumulating loot, and it is easy to discover their intentions even if these are couched in the most obscure Latin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bearing in mind the constant motives of the Roman Catholic Inquisition, note how revealing is the United Press dispatch of November 15,1938, carried by the San Diego </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sun:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bert.IK.</span><span class="font9">—Fifty thousand Jews have been arrested throughout the Reich in the last few days, reliable sources estimated today. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many* of those arrested are influential or wealthy Jews held as hostages. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">New suicides were reported as the Jews tried to raise nearly $500,000,000 to pay a fine levied on Jews as a whole and repair damage done to Jewish property by [Nazi] rioters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Behind the announced Nazi motive for the drive —the killing of a minor German official of the embassy in Paris—some financial circles saw an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acute Nati economic crisis</span><span class="font9"> as the real cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Germany faces a huge and rapidly inounting deficit, it was said. New funds are needed for Field Marshal Hermann Wilhelm Goering’s four-year plan of economic self-sufficiency, which hag placed a heavy drain on the nation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The starkness of this theft thus plainly appears! Continuing the proof that it is also a theft of the perpetual popish Inquisition, note the words of former priest Leo H. Lehman quoted from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Social Frontier,</span><span class="font9"> November 1938, Vol. 5, No. 39, pages 47-50:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been said that Adolph Hitler, in his campaign against the Jews, accomplished in six months what the Catholic Church failed to accomplish in six centuries. Be that as it may, there isjio doubt that the Hitleran measures coincide in every detail with the rigid anti-Semitic edicts, still extant, of the popes of Rome. Word for word, leaf for leaf, the German Fuehrer could have copied his decrees from the official versions of these edicts of the Papacy down the centuries. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the monolithic unity of the third German Reich, as in the great Latin unity of medieval Papacy, the Jew is branded as the refractory and disparate element and is at once spat forth from the iron jaws of the totalitarian Moloch. Pope Innocent was being prophetic as well as expedient when he declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“As Cain was a wanderer and an outcast, not to be killed by anyone but marked with the sign of fear on his forehead, so the Jews—against whom the voice of the blood of Christ cries out—although they are not to be killed, must always be dispersed as wanderers upon the face of the earth.” [Migne Patrologia, CCXV, 1291]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Germany received specific orders regarding the Jews from such popes as Gregory IX. To the archbishops and bishops of Germany he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ... We therefore command each and every one of you to have all the excesses of the Jews completely repressed, lest they should presume to raise their necks from the yoke of servitude in contumely of the Redeemer; forbidding them to discuss in any way concerning their faith or rites with Christians. In this matter calling to your aid the help of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the civil power,</span><span class="font9"> inflicting upon Christians, who offer opposition, due ecclesiastical punishment.” . . . [Bull. Rom. Pont., Ill, 497]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pope Eugenius IV, in 1442, also left no doubt that this should be the Catholic attitude toward Jews for all time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We decree and order that from now on, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and for all time,</span><span class="font9"> Christians shall not eat or drink with Jews; nor admit them to feasts, nor cohabit with them, nor bathe with them. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“They are obliged to pay annually a tenth part of their goods and holdings. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“They cannot live among Christians, but in a certain street, separated and segregated from Christians, and outside which they cannot under any pretext have houses. ...” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A century later, in 1555, Pope Paul IV reiterated these restrictions against the Jews and added some new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Popes Pius IV and Martin V made similar decrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler’s Popish Decrees</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Speaking of this Papal legislation anent the Jews, Mr. Lehman continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How much use Hitler has made of it in Germany to line up its 22,000,000 Catholics [publisher’s footnote states, “Nearly 30,000,000 now in Greater Germany”] on his side, has never been told us. But it may well explain why, in spite of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">apparent hostility</span><span class="font9"> between the Nazi regime and the Catholic Church in Germany, Catholics as a body have no fault to find with Hitler's rampant anti-Semitism, The same may be said of Poland, Italy, Spain, and Latin America. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Vatican, it can scarcely be doubted from what is happening just now, has hitched its Star to the Fascist, authoritarian principle of government, for it is more in line with its own traditional principle of authority as to how men shall be ruled. </span><span class="font9">Furthermore the Late ran Pact signed by the Vatican and Mussolini in 1929 re-established the principle and working of the “Twin Powers” of the great Latin unity of Medieval Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although American newspapers report the pope to he hostile to this anti-Semitism, these accounts are to be served piping hot to Americans only; </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">L'Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font9"> issue of August 13, 1938, in a semi-official statement from the Vatican, practically reiterates the pronouncements of other popes which </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;have never been formally revoked&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Luther Strove Against Rome</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No one knows the vices of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as do her sons, such as Luther, Cranmer and many others who had intimate knowledge of the evils, from their experience as her servants. At the Diet of Worms, where Luther was called upon to recant, he stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Papacy both by precept and example haa laid waste all Christendom, body and soul.. . . General complaints witness that the consciences of all believers are snared, harassed, and tormented by the laws of the pope.”—Singmaster’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Martin Luther,</span><span class="font9"> page 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Moreover he had mightily championed the cause of the oppressed commoner,”—Preserved Smith’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life and Letters of Martin Luther,</span><span class="font9"> page 157.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although Luther countenanced the slaughter of the rebels in the Peasants’ Revolt, and he bickered with Erasmus, Zwingli and other reformers, he assisted in one good job. He cost the pope Germany; the same Germany the present pope has completely and overwhelmingly regained through the exploits of her maniacal Inquisitioner, Adolf Hitler. Remember, the Inquisition continues as long as the Hierarchy endures. The leopard never changes its spots.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">H. J. Tholen, Prop., Tholen Jewelry Company, Hays, Kansas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On October 9, 1938, Robert E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aggson, Larned, Kansas, addressed a letter to the sponsors of the Catholic Evidence Guild, Hays, Kansas, in which he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today I listened to a program over the Abilene radio station in which you attempt to identify Jehovah’s witnesses. That is, it appeared that you attempted to answer a question, “Who are Jehovah’s witnesses?” and your answer to the question was very misleading and wrong. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are sincerely attempting to serve the Lord Christ Jesus, and the Almighty God, who is Jehovah, you will not attack, as you did over the air, those who sincerely point out the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why do you pick upon the man Judge Rutherford instead of trying to show to the public from the Scriptures where he was wrong? If you were sincere in your opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses because you thought they were wrong, there would be some excuse for you, and it wouid.be your duty to point out to all where they are being misled, and give them plenty of Bible proof. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' But you have not thoroughly examined the books written by Judge Rutherford. You no doubt are quoting some prejudiced leaders in your organization who are bent on doing injury to Jehovah’s witnesses, whose faithfulness exposes the error's of the religious organizations so that the people can truly find the Lord and serve Him in His appointed way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You make the false statement that Jehovah’s witnesses are ^gainst all civil government, and yet your leaders well know that Jehovah’s witnesses obey every righteous law of the land, refusing only to comply with the laws that arc contrary to the laws of the Almighty God. And because Jehovah’s witnesses put the’laws of God above all others, many in the Catholic organization seek thereby to bring trouble upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The apostle Paul was onee a religionist, and you will recall, if you have read the Scriptures for yourself, that he persecuted Christians. But the Lord revealed the truth to him and he became a true Christian and was persecuted by those whom he was formerly associated with in religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many in the Catholic organization stand in a similar position, and now it is your duty to examine carefully the evidence given in the Watch -Tower books, together with the Bible references, and the events that are transpiring in fulfillment of jfl’opheey, and learn from them that this is Jehovah’s organization under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'Those who are not diligent to prove this to themselves now, and honestly face the facts, will be found fighting against God at Armageddon, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">/ , great battle o£ God Almighty, in which all of Uis enemies will be destroyed. It is indeed a serious matter, and the Lord’s watchmen are sounding the warning throughout the earth o£ the early destruction of the religious systems and other institutions of this world, just as Noah gave warning about the Deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses are not against any one Catholic person, but are in fact seeking'to aid those who are misled by the traditions of men. At Ezekiel 3:17 it is written, ‘Watchman . . . give them warning from me’; and at Ezekiel 33: 5 it is written, “He that take th warning shall deliver his soul.” •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As one of his watchmen and witnesses (Isaiah 43:12) I am sending you under separate cover a copy of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font9"> and hope you read it carefully', and look up for yourself the Bible references quoted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah will soon answer all of those who oppose Him and who persecute His witnesses for telling the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yours sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert</span><span class="font9"> E. </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aggson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Postscript:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For many years the Watch Tower has repeatedly' invited the leaders of the Catholic church to debate this question over the air. in fact, about two or three years ago approximately two million five hundred thousand people petitioned Congress to have such a debate, but the Catholic leaders refused to debate. If the Scriptures support the Catholic doctrine, why do they not meet Judge Rutherford’s challenge and let the world see who is right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On October 38, 1938, you replied to Mr. Aggson in a letter, of which you no doubt have a copy, and which letter will appear in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> magazine as a part of this communication. No doubt you will be pleased to have it given as wide publicity as possible. You also enclosed to him copies of your broadcasts over K.FB1 of dates February 14, 1937, and September 12, 1937, and two clippings from Catholic papers, one entitled “Attacks on Church Grow: Rutherford Makes Former Anti-Catholic Groups Look like Pikers”, and one entitled “Processions”, which contains a second attack on Judge Rutherford and occupies over a column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is hard to pick up a Catholic paper nowadays that does not contain an attack on the judge; which 'rather makes foolish your proposition that “no Catholic Church lead</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">' It so happens that the editor of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font9">(the writer) has known Judge Rutherford for more than thirty years, and, of all the men he ever met, has never found one so scrupulous ..in his treatment of God’s Word, so scrupulous in his desire, at all costs to himself, to do just right in his service of God, and so scrupulous to love his neighbor as himself. One wonders, therefore, how you and all other spokesmen for the Hierarchy find it so convenient and so easy to refer to him as “unscrupulous&quot;. You will pardon the observation that such methods of argument betray Catholic training in the art of reviling and lying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In your letter to Mr. Aggson you mention that there are plenty of priests by the name of Patrick O’Brien, but insist that none of them wrote the letter which was published in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">L’Aurora,</span><span class="font9"> Philadelphia, Pa. You will be interested to know that £’</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aurora</span><span class="font9"> now has a little booklet, for 10c, containing the entire letter of Mr. O’Brien in facsimile. The editor of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">L’Aurora</span><span class="font9"> (unfriendly to both the Roman Hierarchy and Judge Rutherford) indicated that an early step of the Hierarchy would be to unfrock or disown Mr. O’Brien. You can take that up with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">L&quot; Aurora.</span><span class="font9"> Judge Rutherford quoted from the published letter, which he had every right to do. You sponsored Windle, did you not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your proposition to Mr. Aggson that Judge Rutherford is “a mountebank” makes his letter to you shine by contrast. He wrote you as a gentleman and as a Christian. That, you may know what a mountebank really is, you will be sent in this mail a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> magazine, issue of July 27, 1938, entitled “Windle, Male Chambermaid, to Lose $25,000”. That </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span><span class="font9"> pimp published a booklet which you endorse, offering $1,000 for proof of any error. This offer was accepted. Twenty-five of the errors in the book were pointed out and the matter was put in the hands of Attorney O. R. Moyle. Windle knows he is caught, and refuses to answer, though service was by registered letter. Why back up and endorse a man like Windle and then assail a gentleman like Judge Rutherford as “unscrupulous&quot; and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">“mountebank”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You will also be sent in this mail a copy of Judge Rutherford’s booklet entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Uncov-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3ANUARY 29, 1939 </span><span class="font9">er rd, wherein is abundant evidence, scrupulously taken from Roman Catholic authorized sources, with citations of authorities, and all the scriptures any honest man could desire, that the Roman Catholic Church is the church of the Devil, not the church of God in any sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your second clipping, about Mr. Felix, of Pilot Grove, Mo., is endorsement by you of another mountebank.

You should be interested in the lovely pieturps that show him at his work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Pope Gregory VII, who in the year 1063 announced that Genesis 1 ■. 16 referred to himself as “the greater light” that “rules the day” “in the firmament of heaven”. You can find this duplicated in most asylums for the insane, where various persons, deceived by the same devil that deceives the popes, think they are Jesus Christ, and entitled to run everything on earth, in heaven or in hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was the great Author of the Word of God that preserved it. He used various instrumentalities; among them the Hebrew scribes who shielded it for centuries before any such institution as the Roman Hierarchy came into existence. He used Ptolemy II to have those Hebrew Scriptures translated into Greek [the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Septuagint],</span><span class="font9"> and all the Greek Scriptures, such as the Alexandrine MS., were never at any time in the exclusive custody of the Church of Rome. The “church of Rome” as the Roman Catholic Church is not once mentioned in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You are „ quite correct in your statement that never in its history. have the gates of hell swung as wide for the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as they are swinging now. Judge Rutherford shows that Jesus, who has “the keys of death and of hell”, is swinging them wide open and they will swing wider and wider until, in Armageddon, that evil institution disappears for ever from among men. While it remains it'is impossible for Christianity to lift its head to any appreciable extent, and a high order of civilization is out of the question.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery (London)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Tendency to Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• Undoubtedly a Labor candidate for Parliament voiced some truth when he said, “In asserting that Fascism is a menace to this country I do not base my assertion on the theatrical performances of Sir Oswald Mosley, but on something much more subtle and insidious—the Fascism of Mr. Chamberlain. The new capitalism which is arising in this country, with its milk boards, its potato schemes and its fish boards, its quotas and subsidies, is Fascism. It has no regard for the well-being of the workers in industry or the good of the consumers. It is apparent that the ruling classes and the industrial magnates are determined to retain their power and wealth at all costs.” No doubt the Nazi form of totalitarianism will not be attempted in this country, but in its Fascist disguise it would be welcomed ■ by many. The democratic form of government may be retained in theory, and those who have power and wealth will submit to some limitations if means can be devised which promise to keep them in their hold on the resources of the nation. But, as the following extract plainly shows, in times of stress it is not the people who decide what the country shall do, though that is the essence of democratic government: it is the Government that decides, which may mean one man’s decision. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font9">Ch amber lai ji in Parliament said after the Munich talks, “In the last resort it would have been I and I alone who would have to say that Yes or No which would decide the fate of millions of my countrymen, of their wives, of their families.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Panaceas</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• When Jesus was telling His disciples of the things which would come to pass at the time </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">His coming in the pbwer of His kingdom He said that then many deceivers would arise, and said, “Take heed that no man deceive you.” The faithful followers of Christ do take heed and are saved from the many deceptions </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font9">being raised by deceivers and false prophets. But in these days of distress there are many who are burdened by troubles, and many are fearful of the things coming on the earth, not having learned the way to safety, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font9">where real help is to be found. The witness to the establishment of the Kingdom goes mightily forward, as Jesus said, but the Devil, the deceiver and adversary, is particularly busy seeking to divert attention from the message of the Kingdom. His chief instrument is religion, and there is a stirring in the ranks of the religionists to try to get those blinded by it to trust to them and their incantations. Blind leaders of the blind, their efforts can only do injury to those who listen and follow them. Both “fall into the ditch”, as the Lord said. Also apart from religionists w,ould-bo saviors are announcing themselves and their theories. Some are frankly human, they are as ungodly as the League of Na- , tions: they do not take God into any of their ’ thoughts. The Devil will either help a man to religion, knowing that he can thereby mislead him, or, he will make him believe he does not need God at all. Some of the announcers of the way of salvation stand apart from organized religion, but make use of the Scriptures. They choose texts in order to get some appeal for their theories and in support </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">themselves. To many these are very seductive. These world - healers, mostly anonymous in their announcements, are easy in their use of the Scriptures, but always there is an ’entire absence of desire to turn the minds </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">those whom they seek to gather as disciples to the Word of God for instruction and guidance. In this they are of the same mind </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9">the religionists who use the Bible in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font9">terests of their beliefs and their institutions, but will not give heed to it to seek in humility what God says by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A section of world-healers is advertising its panacea, an easy way of salvation. Taking the words of the Lord by His prophet Joel, “Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved,” these advertise them as being just the one thing needed for safety. There is no suggestion of possible conditions to be met, or of the circumstances in which Jehovah will hear the call, though the apostle Peter showed in his application of Joel’s words as recorded in Acts 2:16-36 that Jehovah will' hear only as the call is made through Christ, who is made Lord over all the works of God. The Jews rejected Christ, though they professed obedience to Jehovah, and because of that they were rejected. These panacea people </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">have no real use for Christ and His atonement, and they are </span><span class="font9">like the unfaithful Jews however much they may profess to worship God. Professing to serve God in the interests of the people, they charge nothing for such ad-viee as they seek to give, nor (they say) will they take donations for their work on behalf of their friends. Their heal-all is a very simple thing. Again using the Scriptures they say healing is by water and the spirit, and (they add) by strict obedience to the advice they </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">give. The </span><span class="font9">applicant for help who will sign </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">set form of words has a small piece of linen </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sent </span><span class="font9">to him, supercharged, it would seem, with </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">bit </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">magic. This is to be immersed in a glass of water to be drunk on rising, and is to be followed through the day by three or </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">four </span><span class="font9">other such drinks. The bit of linen never loses its potency —so long as the credulity lasts; but a necessary item is that with the first morning drink some stated words must be used or the effect is lost. The bit of linen must be very well charged wipi their magic; for two tablespoonfuls taken from the glass will make a whole bathful effective for outward healing, and more valuable for ordinary refreshment. Cure for almost all ills of body and mind may be expected to follow the use of the water, though it is allowed that sometimes a doctor or surgeon may be necessary. No doubt the common-sense part of this treat</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ment </span><span class="font9">is what is depended on forzresults; for water is good for all, a nd, probably is used less than might well be for general advantage. There is more magic for those who cannot keep money in their purse. To help in this a bit of blue material is supplied, sewn up </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">small compass, to be carried in the purse or worn on the underclothing; it has an effect </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">similar </span><span class="font9">to that of the bit of linen in water! Though money is not taken for showing the way of salvation, there are rather expensive books to get by which the believer gets 'The spirit”. To such absurdity are reduced the words of the Scriptures which tell of Jesus coming by water and the spirit!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This particular panacea springs from a revival of some demoniacal prophecies published from time to time since the great fire of London in 1666; but it is directly connected with the “prophecies” of Joanna Southcott, a religious fanatic who died 120 years ago. Joanna </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">claimed she </span><span class="font9">was chosen to be the mother of the man-child of Revelation 12, whose birth would bring in the new heavens and new </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">egrth. </span><span class="font9">Unmarried, she seemed about to be-</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARV 25, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">£ome a mother ■, but when the event happened there was no child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Apparently, so her followers still believe, it was an ethereal child, and was caught up to heaven! Before her death, soon afterwards, Joanna sealed her prophecies in a strong box, to be opened only by 24 bishops of the Church of England, in each other’s presence. The bishops have too much dignity—and common sense—to touch the thing, despite the frequent appeals from Joanna’s followers, and so these are left in the dark, not daring to break the seals. Now, led by another woman, they are advertising themselves as having that which will save from trouble and distress all who will hear them and obey their foolish and stupid directions. In themselves these things would not be worth notice; but these are times of stress, and the fact that the advertisements increase reveals a persistency indicating that some are being deceived by the misuse of the Scriptures, and some who really desire to know the truth may for a time be hindered from learning the message of the salvation of the Lord and the way of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Totalitarianism in Trade</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• The “monster” is setting up in trade; a.t least so far as Germany is concerned. It is credibly reported that direct evidence is held that Germany is undercutting British prices quoted on contracts for South American business by 25 percent. The German State has set up in business, and individual concerns cannot compete with it. The secretary of Overseas Trade department gave some facts in .Parliament revealing this competition, particularly in relation to Britain’s trade with the South East European countries, where the German government is trying to monopolize trade. The German State subsidize their exports, and they pay, on paper, unusually heavy prices for their imports. The payment is made in goods of less value than is expected. The German people must suffer to keep up the enormous costs of the Nazi government; they are taxed at -both ends, they must sell cheap and buy dear. The British government Trade department is trying to devise some schemes to counteract those of the German state trade. Big Business does not mind having a form of Nazi rule in its own domain, but it cries out when it itself is subjected to it in this fashion. Perhaps this aspect of the situation will give pause to those who have been inclined to favor the activity of the Nazi rule.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>The Roman Catholics &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• These are somewhat perturbed because they find that the more intelligent members of the community lean towards what is called the Left in polities. Men of thought naturally turn away from the Fascist, Nazi totalitarianism religion of Rome, Rome claims to give freedom to its members and adherents, and it docs give its children some liberty to run about in its own grounds; but its rule is hard and unalterable. In Britain and in America it poses as the champion of liberty, and the savior of all that is valuable in life. But its deceptions are exposed, and it is feeling the impact of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The English Roman Catholic papers mark their pleasure in being able , to report that Czechoslovakia, has again turned Christian. Dr. Benes, a Freemason, had no use for some of the foolery of the “holy church'’’, and he caused some of their public images to be removed. He has been replaced by a Roman Catholic president, and the local hierarchy is energetically reasserting itself. The new president ■went in state to high Mass, accompanied by the cardinal, and to mark the occasion the skull of ‘‘good king Wenceslas” was brought out, and as a high honor the cardinal held it out for the president to kiss it, which he did in veneration. A good start for sane government for that distressed people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Modern Evangelism”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• This term has appeared in some sections of Nonconformity. Whether it is used' to push the sales of a book recently published, or it is hoped by it to arouse some activity in religious sections, is not yet clear. It originates with the lectures of a religious teacher, a professor in a Nonconformist college in Oxford. .This lecturer, the author of the book, frankly declares his nonacceptanee of the truth of the Gospel accounts of the ministry of Jesus. He docs not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, does not believe the accounts of the miracles of feeding the multitudes, though he is whiling to believe that Jesus did some wonderful healing of the sick. He does not believe that the discourses recorded by the apostle John were spoken by the Lord, nor the accounts of His resurrection and ascension. He is an infidel in those matters; and if his church organization were what it claims to be, he would be put among the infidels, now named “Freethinkers” to distinguish them from the religious infidels. But he stands high in his profession; and as his profession necessitates that he shall be a preacher of the Gospel, he is ready to tell the world of this modern evangelism. One wonders what his good news is; for an evangelist must be a preacher of good news or he misuses the word. The Nonconformists deserve the indifference they receive from those to whom they profess to make their appeal. Men have come to see that these leaders a\e not honest men, 41 nd they refuse to accept them and their teaching, which, after all, is but a negation, a dead thing. Not ail are so frank as this professor, but he is in a privileged position, and his community, helpless to arouse interest in their cause, are at least somewhat pleased to have such a man who can show himself the equal, of the bishops of the Church of England, who proclairrutheir unbelief in the Bible. These men are trying to strengthen the house they have built on the sand: they feel the winds which are beginning to blow\ and which will surely bring down the house they have built for themselves, as Jesus said: “And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.” (Matthew 7:27) Romanists have an advantage over the Protestants; not that they will escape the destruction, but in that they do not have to keep strengthening their house or repairing the walls and roof. They set their doctrines and dogmas long centuries ago, and they stay put. No Modernism , for them. They watch with cynical interest the ever-increasing infidelity of so-called “Rrot-estant” sects: they see them wandering in the mists, and wait for the time when the wanderers own they are lost, and their lights gone out. Rome is modern enough in all that is necessary to keep their organization alive; for the Papacy, guided by its ‘Hierarchy of Authority’, which in turn is led of the Devil, 'who has deceived the whole world, can keep its sails trimmed to every wind that blows. It will appear to stand when the others have fallen; but it cannot withstand the whirlwind which will fall upon it as certainly as the Word of God is sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ The funnels for the new Mauretania were made of aluminum alloy. The alloy saves weight, and the non-corrosive feature is valuable. Some of the new castings for the Mauretania are of huge size, the stem frame alone being nearly one hundred feet in length.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ George Amberman, knight of the throttle, deserves a place in history. Suddenly attacked with massive cerebral hemorrhage he brought his train to a perfect stop at Mineola, L. I., and was found unconscious at the controls. He died within two hours, and then his fellow railroad men remembered the unusual efforts he had made to make perfect stops for his tfain within the last fifteen minutes in which he was privileged to serve his fellow men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ A great improvement in the Pullman bed is the new arrangement by which the passenger may dress and undress in a vertical position instead of struggling into his clothes like a caterpillar climbing a leaf. The section of the bed temporarily lifted to allow for the space for dressing may be operated either by the passenger or by the porter by means of a cord.</span></p>

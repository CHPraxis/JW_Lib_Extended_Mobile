<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“SALVATION”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We take special pleasure in announcing this new book, written by the president of the Society. It was the feature release at the recent world-wide convention of Jehovah’s witnesses with its hub at New York City. The author of this book for the times describes it as “A text-book for the Jonadabs”. But a study of its 384 pages of contents will prove to you it is meat in due season and a joy to all anointed Christians as well. The author’s edition only is now available, containing a facsimile of a letter to the reader in the author’s own hand and which you will much appreciate. This edition being limited, and the initial costs of manufacture being heavy, a contribution of 50c is asked per copy. Early translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> in more than twenty other languages is assured, and due announcement will be made on publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DIVINE MANDATE” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The entire month of August has been designated “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period. This midsummer witnessing Period will be specially favored by the release then, for distribution to the general public at the popular contribution of 25c a copy, of the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> Circulation of no other book could be more appropriate for this Period than that of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> with its beautiful treatment of the recently revealed truth on the “Divine Mandate”. What anointed witness, or what person of good will in line for this divine mandate, could hold back from a prompt and large part in this Testimony Period? All will begin their preparations now. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> will give details to guide you. The regular report should follow up your activities at the close of the month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;So thou, 0 son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and rvarn them from me.”—Ezek. 33:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH'S prophets speak in exact harmony. They could not speak otherwise. It is Jehovah’s message which they are announcing. The name of Jehovah must be declared throughout the earth before he shows the enemy His great power. (Ex. 9:16) The warning must be given of the approaching disaster. It was so in the time of the miniature fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and it must be so at the time of the complete fulfillment upon the land of “Christendom”. The prophet Ezekiel was also sent by Jehovah to give warning to Jerusalem, and Ezekiel there pictures those whom the Lord uses to give warning to “Christendom” at the present time. In the fulfillment of the prophecy the “feet” members of Christ Jesus are called the “watchman&quot; because they watch for their brethren and for all who love God and they watch for the kingdom interests, and then, above all, they are watching the hand of the Almighty God that they may ascertain and do his will. (Ps. 123: 2) The watchman is diligent to look for the events which God brings to pass, furnishing a lead for his people, and they are quick when receiving orders from the Lord to obey the same. All the members of the body of Christ now on the earth, and which are collectively called “the remnant”, are also collectively the watchman of the Lord. To them the Lord makes known the meaning of his prophecies, and, when ascertaining what they must do, those of the remnant do it with joy. Thus they keep in step with God’s organization, which moves majestically forward to accomplish his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Chapter two of the prophecy of Joel opens with an emphatic command given to Joel, who represents the faithful witnesses of Jehovah now on earth: “Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand.”—Joel 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> As Joel the prophet sounded the alarm to Jerusalem, so now the remnant in fulfillment of the prophecy must in obedience to God’s command sound the alarm among all persons of God’s organization, and within the borders of “Christendom”. The remnant has received the commission from Jehovah’s hands to make proclamation of the vengeance of the day of the Most High and thus to sound the warning. That commission is given alone to the anointed, as it is written: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to . . . proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and [to declare] the day of vengeance of our God.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) The sounding of the trumpet of warning is for the benefit of those in God’s organization, as well as for those who claim to be the servants of Jehovah: “Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord; look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.”—Isa. 51:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> To those who love Jehovah and who love the appearing of Christ Jesus, his King, the trumpet gives forth a sound that fills their hearts with joy, announcing the day of jubilee. But the effect is exactly the contrary to the religionists. To those who practice religion the trumpet of God gives a sound of distress. The religious leaders have long reveled in their ability to carry on according to their own ideas, and they would not now sound the alarm if the opportunity to do so were given to them. On the contrary, those religionists are designated by the Lord as “dumb dogs&quot;, “lying down,” and ‘loving slumber’ and ease and to lie in the beds of tradition made by their fathers. (Isa. 56:10) The religious leaders refuse to recognize that Jehovah’s day is here. They do not want that day of Jehovah, and they refuse to hear of the battle of Armageddon. On the contrary, they cry out to the people under them and who support the religious organizations: “Peace, peace,” “when there is no peace.” Those religious leaders have an avaricious desire to acquire the things that the “present evil world” can furnish them to make them comfortable and easy, and to give them a standing with the other members of the worldly organization. Not one of the religious leaders in all the earth today supports the interest of the kingdom. Concerning such the prophet of the Lord says: “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.”—Jer. 6:13-15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">211</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">* The trumpet must be sounded in Zion, that is to say, in Jehovah’s capital organization, or particularly that part which is on the earth. Christ Jesus having appeared and builded up Zion (Ps. 102:16), he has gathered unto himself the faithful ones remaining on the earth and made them a part of Zion. Christ Jesus is the “Faithful and True Witness” of Jehovah, and those with him at the temple must be witnesses to Jehovah, and it is to such that the command is given to ‘blow the trumpet’. They are under the immediate command of the Lord Jesus Christ and form a part of His capital organization: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.” (Rev. 14:1) With God’s typical people the priests were to sound the alarm of danger; and so in the antitypical or final fulfillment of the prophecy, it is those who are of “the royal priesthood” that must sound the alarm of the near approach of Armageddon, and in doing this they are participating in Jehovah’s “strange work”. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and those with them in their so-called “united Christian religious front”, try to prevent the people from hearing the trumpet of God, and to offset the same those clergymen blow their own tin horns announcing their own greatness and at the same time denounce the witnesses of Jehovah, calling them “Communists”, for want of something else to name them. God’s trumpet is sounded from his “holy mountain”, where Jehovah has placed his King: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) From God’s organization the sound of his trumpet goes throughout the earth, particularly throughout “Christendom”, and it is the privilege of his witnesses to carry this message to the various lands. T</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font5"> is further corroborated by another of God’s prophets, to wit: “And he said, The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.”—Amos 1: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•All who love God fear him with a godly fear; hence the prophecy states: “Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble.” The anointed remnant and their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, are the only ones who really fear God and who therefore take the wise course. Knowing that the sound of the trumpet is a message of Jehovah, which means really a complete deliverance for his faithful servants and at the same time the destruction of the wicked and the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name, has the effect of filling the faithful with a godly fear and with rejoicing in their hearts. They have the joy of the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ, the King, has appeared to their joy, and they know he shall vindicate Jehovah’s name: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that ren-dereth recompense to his enemies.”—Isa. 66:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> To the faithful servants of Jehovah there is a clear and marked distinction between the noise that comes from the religionists who pretend to represent the Lord, and the “voice from the temple”, which is the voice of the Lord’s devoted ones uttered and led by Jesus Christ. The effect upon the religionists is exactly opposite to that upon those who love God. Like Belshazzar, who saw the handwriting on the wall, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied religious elements, shaking with fear and dread because of the message of truth announcing the doom of religion to them, are made mad, and their first thought is to stop the message by destroying the messengers and their work. Regardless of the opposition, Jehovah’s witnesses go straight forward in the performance of their part, sounding the trumpet, and their zeal and devotion to God are a token to the Hierarchy of the near downfall of that institution. They do not wish to hear such warning, and hence they vent their spleen against the ones whom the Lord uses to give the warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•Why should an alarm be sounded now? Because “the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand”. Jehovah always gives notice and warning in advance of his positive action, in order that those who properly fear him take the right course and find the way of escape and the place of safety: “A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.”—Prov. 22: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• “The day of Jehovah” began in 1914, when he enthroned his King, and therefore it is at hand now, and will reach a climax in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. His “strange work” is now being done to serve notice upon all of his purpose, that they may have no doubt that Jehovah is acting. The “strange work” will be quickly followed by God’s “strange act&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DARKNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> This is a day of darkness for “Christendom”. Jehovah by his prophet has emphasized the coming of this day of great darkness, but the religionists have ignored God’s Word and have relied upon their own opinions and that of other men who preceded them, whom they call their “fathers”; and all their allies today love to have it so. Speaking of this day by his prophet, Jehovah says: “A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.”—Joel 2: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> This description agrees exactly with the facts as now observed by all those who give heed to the Word of God. Spealdng by the mouth of his prophet, Jehovah says of this day: “The day of the Lord is darkness, and not light,” to religionists and all of Satan’s organization. Then the Lord illustrates how men act in this day who are surrounded by the darkness and have no light: “As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?” —Amos 5:18-20.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The religion-mongers and practitioners will find no way of escape. Regardless of what they do the Lord will search them out and see that the proper recompense is ministered unto them. (Jer. 25:35) “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.”—Zeph. 1:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Such is the condition in which the enemies of God find themselves now. They will not be able to escape darkness: “But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.” (Nah. 1:8) Added to their mental and spiritual darkness that has come upon the religionists, God sends his army of “locusts”, which have plagued and which continue to plague those of Satan’s world, even as the army of locusts down in Egypt plagued those who were against Jehovah and against his people: “And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.” —Ex. 10:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> These prophecies are today being fulfilled upon “Christendom”. It is the time of which Jehovah speaks, a time of darkness to the enemy and of light to those who love him and serve him faithfully and truly; and concerning this he says through his prophet : “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.”—Isa. 60:1,2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The ’ '•lit from the temple daily increases and makes gl s those who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom; and, therefore, while the enemy is in darkness those who love and faithfully serve Jehovah God have an ever-increasing light, and with that light their joy increases. “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.” (Prov. 4:18,19) The religionists are in the dark because they reject the Word of God. Religionists do not believe the Word of God, and hence go contrary to his law and to his prophets: “To the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(Rotherham')</span><span class="font5"> no dawning day] in them.” (Isa. 8: 20) It is the time when wicked spirits control the rulers of this world. (Eph. 6:12) It is the day when Satan is putting forth his last desperate effort to destroy the human race.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> This is the “day of clouds”, which betoken (1) the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ (Ex. 13:21; Ex. 19:9,16; Matt. 26: 64; 1 Thess. 4:17; Rev. 1:7), and (2) a time of distress and trouble, announcing the approaching storm of Jehovah upon his enemies. Mark the difference between those who love God and those who are his enemies: the joy that fills the heart of God’s people, and the effect upon the enemy: “I will praise thee, 0 Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. I will be glad and rejoice in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, 0 thou Most High. When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.”— Ps. 9:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> In this time of darkness upon his enemies the Lord causes his light to shine on his “other sheep”, while he gathers them to himself and comforts them: “As a shepherd secketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.” (Ezek. 34:12) At the early morn, when the dawn is upon the mountains, the sunlight is hid; and so it is with the enemy today. As the kingdom glory appears even now to religionists there is an uneven and unsteady light which is daily growing darker. In this condition of darkness upon the enemy a “great people” appears, great because used by Jehovah to have part in his “strange work”, “a great people and a strong [and bold </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham}]</span><span class="font5">(Joel 2: 2) At Joel 1: 6 these are called “a nation”. In the complete fulfillment of this part of the prophecy the word “people” is used evidently for the reason that it is now God’s people whom he has taken out for his name’s sake which come as a swarm of locusts to proclaim the name of Jehovah. They are not great in themselves, either in name or fame or power, nor great in the sight of men, but are regarded by such as very insignificant. They are made to appear as great, however, by reason of the work done and their methods employed to reach the hundreds of millions of people and place in their hands hundreds of millions of copies of the message of warning. These people who are taken out by Jehovah for his name are bold, because this is the day of the Lord’s judgment and his witnesses must be bold and thereby show their love for Jehovah. (1 John 4:17,18) This does not mean that they are rude, but that they are fearless of creatures, fearing only God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> That which Jehovah’s witnesses have accomplished in recent years is phenomenal in the eyes of many. As stated by the prophet: “There hath not been ever [before] the like.” The same thing was said of the swarms of locusts down in Egypt. (Ex. 10:14) Never had there been such a widespread publication of the truth of God’s Word as during the past few years; and this is true because it is God’s time and it is his work. From the year 1921 to 1931 Jehovah’s witnesses placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 110,565,401. Since 1931 the work accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses has been even greater. The message has been broadcast by hundreds of radio stations each week and at certain times by international broadcast. Thousands of phonographs and sound machines have been employed to proclaim the message, free tracts numbering many millions have been put in the hands of the people, and at the end of the year 1938 the publications of the Society (the books and booklets) in the hands of the people exceeded 275,000,000, and this in more than 70 different languages. Nothing like that ever before in the history of man. It has been accomplished by the power of the Almighty God and Christ Jesus. This distribution of literature and witness work is not a religious movement, but the publication of God’s Word, and done at his commandment. When the strange work of proclaiming the truth is done such will never be repeated, because there will be no occasion to do so; hence says the prophet: “Neither shall there be any more after it [after them </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font5">], even to the years of many generations.” The “strange work” is for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and following Armageddon all creatures that breathe shall be praising Jehovah’s name, the vindication of which will have been fully accomplished, and no need for a repetition thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Since the beginning of Jehovah’s “strange work” that work has progressed with intensified zeal or heat. God’s army of servants, likened unto locusts, has appeared with the sound that is the sound of the fifth trumpet described in Revelation 9:1-12. That fifth trumpet began to sound in 1926, at the time of a convention of God’s people in London, England. At that time “Christendom” had become guilty of the “transgression of desolation” by setting forth a Devilish organization claiming the right to rule the earth instead of God’s kingdom. (Dan. 8:13) Prior to 1926 there was sounded a series of trumpets or alarms, which are described at Revelation, chapters eight, nine and eleven. It was during that time, that is, from 1922 to 1926, that some work foretelling the coming of the locusts had to be done. That work is described in Revelation 16:1-9 as “plagues”. Those plagues heated up the religionists, and were therefore like a flame of fire. In this connection mark the description by Joel (2:3): “A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.” This means that before the coming of the army of locusts there came a devouring flame unto the religionists. That proclamation of the truth well heated up the religionists, who then began to witness the burning up of their pastures as a result of the heat. Then when the “strange work” has been completed the destructive flame at Armageddon comes upon them and finishes the job. The organized and progressive witnessing by God’s faithful servants began in 1922, after Christ Jesus had assembled the approved ones at the temple and anointed them, and this work must progress until the conclusion of God’s “strange work”, which is quickly to be followed by his “strange act”. Hence before the coming of the army of “locusts” as such, the heat was turned on; and behind the locusts a flame of fire shall burn. &quot;As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire, so persecute them [God’s enemies] with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.”—Ps. 83:14,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah put that prayer in the Scriptures to be uttered by his faithful witnesses, and that in harmony with his will; and that prayer God answers according to his will. In symbolic phrase another prophet of Jehovah describes the scorching of “Christendom” and the wasting of her pastures: “And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree; the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein. And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”—Ezek. 20:47,48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The effect of this scorching heat and the work of the locusts upon “Christendom” is described as “the land is as the garden of Eden before them”, which was the condition prior to 1922. The Protestant clergy and allies vigorously advocated the League of Nations as “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. The League was then set up, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy climbed upon the back of the old “beast”. A great religious revival had been predicted by the clergy following the World War, and hence those religionists tried to start the old chariot to moving. In 1919 the Interchurch World Movement of the Protestant Churches of America was launched. At least they tried to make her go. Much money was collected and spent to boost the thing, and hence the field at that time before the religionists looked good, like unto a garden. In the spring of 1919 the National Catholic Welfare Conference was organized. Fascism raised its head in Italy, the same year, and at that time the Vatican, looking for an instrument to be used apparently against Bolshevism but to be used in reality against the message of God’s kingdom, seized upon Fascism as such a desired instrument. Shortly thereafter Fascism put the Papacy back into temporal power and the Hierarchy became a large political machine. For some time prior thereto the Roman Catholic organization was, as the prophet describes, ‘the forgotten harlot of modern Tyre’. In those days of refreshing the old lady redecked herself and began to sing her songs in an effort to entice others and to regain her former political and commercial paramours. (Isa. 23:15-17) February 6, 1922, Cardinal Ratti was selected pope, and about the same time Mussolini assumed control of Italy. So at that time the field, that is, the nations of the earth, looked to the religionists very promising, like unto a garden of pleasure; and so they looked upon it and called it “The garden of the Lord”, and the religionists felt and acted as though they were riding upon the top of the waves of the universe. In the eyes of religionists there seemed to be no particular reason to be worried about anything that Jehovah’s witnesses might do. True, those witnesses were considered by religionists as a pestiferous crowd, but they expected them to do little or nothing. The religionists figured that they had killed the work and influence of Jehovah’s witnesses during the World War, and hence the religious leaders were riding high and strutting their stuff. At the same time, by the grace of Jehovah and under the immediate command of Christ Jesus at the temple, Jehovah’s witnesses were reviving and getting their work in order. In the Lord’s due time Jehovah’s army was ready and he sent them forth, likened unto a cloud of locusts. That was the beginning of real activity and real organized forward movement of Jehovah’s witnesses, and now, after the Lord’s locusts have been at work for a few years, the religious field looks like a place of desolation. Hence the Lord, by his prophet, says: “Behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The effect of the invasion of the “locusts” of the Lord and the declaration of God’s judgment against all religion, and particularly the so-called “Christian religion”, discloses that the same is a fraud and a snare of the Devil. Honest people of the world, learning the truth, now look upon religion as a desolate thing, as a snare and a racket, and they see that it is under the blight of God’s adverse judgment. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah have not been partial to any religion, but have, at the command of the Lord, boldly announced that the purpose of all religion is the defamation of the name of Almighty God, the scheme of the Devil to turn the people away from God. The declaration of the truth has been against all such enemy organizations: “And none hath escaped them.” (R.F.) Not even the mighty and the high of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have been able to go on without taking notice. In 1933, with great gusto and much noise made by that Catholic organization and their political allies the so-called “holy year” was announced, the purpose of which was to restore in the minds of the people “the garden of Eden” appearance for religion. Then the Lord by his army of “locusts” pulled the camouflage off religion, and since then the people have become well informed and know that all religion is of the Devil and is the chief opponent and bitter enemy of Christianity. Likewise Fascism and Nazism and Communism have been shown up as devilish instruments, upon which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization rides, and for which it acts as spiritual adviser. The people are learning that the purpose of that unholy combine is to rule the world in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ. They see that religionists have put the “corporate state” above Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Whom has the Lord used to bring about this condition of devastation upon the fields of religion! He has used his faithful servants, who act strictly under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ. In all the efforts put forth by the Lord’s army of locusts no physical force or carnal weapons have been used; and such is exactly in harmony with the prophecy. There has been no physical destruction of any houses, property or person. Locusts do not work that way. Jehovah’s witnesses, under the command of their Head, Christ Jesus, turn on the light and the heat and devour the false teachings of men, which have been invented by the Devil and used by his agents to defame the name of God and turn the people away into darkness. At the present time Jehovah’s witnesses see how they have been favored by the Lord and how he long ago caused this prophecy to be written foretelling present-day conditions and its fulfillment in this present time. They are very much encouraged and comforted, and their hope is brightened, and on they march with joy! The Lord continues to furnish his people with evidence that he is at the helm and that as long as his witnesses remain faithful to God and his King they may be certain of having everlasting blcisings bestowed upon them by the hand of the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> For the further encouragement of the faithful remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs or “other sheep”, the Lord by this prophecy gives a minute description of those that make up his army likened unto locusts: “The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.” (Joel 2:4) Horses symbolically picture war equipment; as it is written: “Horses prepared unto battle.” Thus are pictured the faithful witnesses of Jehovah who go right on in his work as he commands, not hesitating for anything. The locusts have an oblong-shaped head, somewhat like that of a horse, and he uses his head: “And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.”—Rev. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Locusts are not afraid, nor is the horse afraid, and it is to such that the faithful witnesses of Jehovah are likened: “Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.” (Job 39:19, 20) The big religious leaders and allies try to frighten Jehovah’s witnesses into submission and to cause them to cease their witness work, but the faithful hear and obey the Lord Jesus Christ, who says to them: “Fear them not.” (Matt. 10:26,28) The locusts resemble the horse going into battle, and so Jehovah’s witnesses push on in the fight regardless of opposition: “He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.” (Job 39: 22) Jehovah’s witnesses love God and Christ, and “perfect love casteth out fear”. (1 John 4:18) They know they are going in the fight against bitter opposition, but God gives to them the assuring command that he gave to Jeremiah: “Be not afraid of [them].” “Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.”—Jer. 1:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> A better translation of the latter part of this verse of the prophecy of Joel reads: “And as warhorses so shall they run.” (Joel 2:4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham) </span><span class="font5">They run to and fro in the service. They do not run away from the battle, but at the Lord's command they increase their speed. “The horse rusheth into the battle.” (Jer. 8:6) “His horses are swifter than eagles.” (Jer. 4:13) Since the beginning of the year 1939 Jehovah’s witnesses have shown an increased speed and fearlessness in the “strange work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are always anxious to do with all their might that which is possible for them to do. In January, 1939, the Society suggested that more time might be occupied in the field of witnessing, and suggested that sixty hours per month is not unreasonable. Some who claim to be the Lord’s servants have objected and complained of that increased activity. All are reminded that the Society has no authority to give commands and that the sixty hours in the field work is merely a suggestion; and it is believed that the Lord caused that suggestion to be made, and it is for each one of the Lord’s servants to do what he thinks to be the Lord’s will. The Lord in his Word has foretold diligence in his service. He likens his faithful workers to war horses, and that of itself is a strong indication that the servant should put forth his very best endeavors in this day of heated battle. Almost all who claim to be on the Lord’s side have gladly accepted and adopted the suggestion, and during the first half of the year the hours of field service have been greatly increased by the workers. Some of these witnesses who have passed the age of threescore and ten have speeded up even more than some of the others and have made as much as seventy hours per month in the field service. Some at first thought themselves unable to carry the phonograph, but now have learned that the burden is easy when in the service of the King. Like a war horse they are going daily in the battle with greater joy. If any desire to look back and take it easy, let them do so. All who really love God will do what they believe is God’s will concerning them, and if they can put in more time they will delight to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> In symbolic language the Lord caused such a clear description of the faithful witnesses that no doubt is left as to their identity. He also describes the harmonious action on the part of those who form his visible organization, and this is further proof that all of the faithful dwell together and work together in peace, having in mind the one thing, the vindication of God’s name. Jehovah’s witnesses are shown as fearless of man’s power or of the Devil’s power and are pushing forward actively in Jehovah’s service in obedience to his commandment: “Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.”—Joel 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*• A similar description is given in The Revelation of Jesus Christ concerning the earthly part of God’s army: “And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.” (Rev. 9:9) The movement of a gigantic swarm of locusts is very noisy, but it is a harmonious noise. Like the illustration, so with the reality. Forward and active movement of Jehovah’s witnesses is now and for some time has been carried on with much publicity, harmonious sound, and what they have done has been done openly and aboveboard. If the clergy in one community oppresses a pioneer a whole swarm goes in immediately and cleans up the community. They call the people’s attention to Jehovah’s name and that his kingdom is here and it is the only possible means of bringing to them peace, prosperity, life and happiness; and their movement is a harmonious song. They warn the people of the near approach of the battle of Armageddon. They do their work systematically and in a well-organized manner, and their movements and sound of warning are much like the oncoming of war chariots hurrying to the battle. It is Jehovah’s war organization, the invisible part of which is rapidly approaching to destroy the hypocritical and unfaithful “Christendom” and will do the real destructive work; but the remnant go before and announce the fact. God’s great organization, like a huge and irresistible chariot with four tremendous wheels, is described by Jehovah’s prophet Ezekiel as moving forward and crushing all opposition. (Ezekiel first chapter; Ezek. 43:1-3) The forward movement of the Lord’s army of locusts strikes terror into the hearts of the religionists, because to them it is a token of impending destruction.—Phil. 1:28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> The word “mountains”, as used in the prophecy, verse five, symbolically pictures the government organizations of “Christendom”. Such governments attempt to hinder the work of Jehovah’s “locust” army, and resort to various means to accomplish that wrongful purpose. Such government opposition, however, does not deter the witnesses of the Most High nor frighten them into submission. Jehovah’s “strange work” must be done, and God will see to it that it is done according to his will. During the past few years those devoted to God and his King have fully recognized and acknowledged God and Christ Jesus as the only higher powers and that all Christians must obey God and Christ, regardless of opposition from man or man-made governments. (Rom. 13:1) The faithful apostles blazed the way, and the faithful followers of Christ now go the same way. (Acts 5: 29) Only a short time ago the Lord’s “little flock” of witnesses were scattered because of the assaults of the religious leaders of the earthly governments. No one of the religionists showed them any favor whatsoever. God took notice of this, foreknew it would come, and foretold it: “And they were scattered because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill; yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.” (Ezek. 34: 5,6) The Lord notified these false shepherds that he would take action. Now Jehovah’s witnesses have received from the Lord a clear vision of his purpose. They trust in God implicitly and go forward without fear of human or Devil institutions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Fires frequently break out and destroy the stubble field following an exceedingly hot and dry period, and such fire is attended with much noise. Even so the united action of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions appears to the religionists “like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble”. The “strange work” of Jehovah is a warning to give the alarm of the fire of Armageddon. God by his spirit moved the apostle Peter to write of such time: “But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.” “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?” (2 Pet. 3:7,10,12) This is further corroborated by the prophet Malachi: “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”—Mal. 4:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> In describing the activities of the locusts, mark the language of Joel’s prophecy: “As a strong people set in battle array.” There the preposition “as” shows that the words did not apply in Joel’s day, when the locusts destroyed the fields, but actually refers to intelligent creatures and human organization, Jehovah’s witnesses. These are not armed with carnal weapons, but they are thoroughly organized and under the command of the great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus. It is the time when Satan and his host, that old Dragon, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘go</span><span class="font5"> forth to make war against God’s organization, and the remnant thereof’ now on the earth. (Rev. 12:17) The army of the Lord set in battle array is not a democratic form of organization, but is under the control and command of the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s King and Field Marshal, and therefore is a theocratic government. This conclusion is proved by the words of The Revelation, which apply to that army under the Lord’s command: &quot;And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had a king [the Lord Jesus Christ] over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit [into which Christ Jesus flings the Devil], whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon [destruction for Satan’s crowd], but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon [destroyer of Satan and his organization].” (Rev. 9:7,11) Jehovah’s witnesses, that is, his army of “locusts”, are without fear of creatures because they know that they are backed up by the almighty power of God. The faces of the “faithful servant” class are as “adamant, harder than flint”, made so by Jehovah, who says to his witnesses : “Fear them [the rebellious religionists] not, neither be dismayed at their looks.” (Ezek. 3: 9) Regardless of opposition the faithful witnesses go straight on doing their assigned work: “Before their face the people shall be much pained [at their presence the peoples are in anguish (R.P.)]; all faces shall gather blackness.”—Joel 2: 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> This applies particularly to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the allied Protestant doctors of divinity and Jewish rabbis. This proof is supported by the fact that they all howl and work together to induce the political, legislative, judicial and other parts of the government organization to take drastic action against Jehovah’s witnesses. The same locusts (Jehovah’s witnesses) are described in The Revelation in these words: “And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth; and unto them [Jehovah’s witnesses] was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men [the religionists] which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they [the religionists] should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die [to escape torment], and death shall flee from them.” —Rev. 9: 3-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> God permits the religionists to exist and to continue in their practice for a short time while his “strange work” is in progress, to the end that they might receive torment, and this they do by having their “religious susceptibilities shocked” when someone speaks in their hearing the message of truth. Concerning the faces of the religionists, the Hebrew text means that their faces have a “gleam” or “flush” of anxiety upon observing the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses and the message which they bring. According to the Authorized Version, their faces “gather blackness”. God’s prophet speaks of the Ninevites in this language: “She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(Hebrew)</span><span class="font5"> a gleam or flush].” —Nahum 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> The faces of the clergy show a flush of anxiety when called upon by Jehovah’s witnesses, and those clergymen usually resort to harsh words against Jehovah’s witnesses, and, seeing that their harsh words do not deter the witnesses but that they fearlessly go on in their work, the religionists conclude that it is a token of impending destruction of them and their racket. Belshazzar was in the same condition when he saw the handwriting on the wall. The religionists know that it is true that they have been weighed in the balance by the Lord and found worthless.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Jehovah by his prophet foretold the united and harmonious action of the faithful witnesses who bear the message of his kingdom. They are not weaklings, but “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might”: “They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks.”—Joel 2:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> The zealous ones are not content with spending a few hours in the service, but they are “up and at it” on every possible occasion. They attack in the strength of the Lord, and Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, continues to provide them with all the needed strength. “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk, and not faint.”—Isa. 40: 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The faithful and zealous ones hear the command of the Lord and hasten to obey: “I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.” (Ps. 119:32) David was a type of Christ Jesus and his body members, and indited this Psalm which is now appropriate for Jehovah’s witnesses: “For thou art my lamp, 0 Lord; and the Lord will lighten my darkness. For by thee I have run through a troop; by my God have I leaped over a wall.”— 2 Sam. 22:29,30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’* The enemies of God’s kingdom that shield, hide and protect themselves behind their political and judicial walls find that these walls are inadequate to shield them. Jehovah’s witnesses do not stop, but, in the language of the prophecy, they ‘climb the walls like men of war’, that is to say, they go on regardless of the walls. Since the Lord’s people have seen and appreciated the theocratic government, which directs them, they have been and are being rapidly disciplined and trained, and they act orderly and fearlessly. Like locusts, they do not stop at tall obstacles, but climb right over them and keep going forward. The religionists have builded up their walls, fortified by politics and commerce, and behind which they attempt to hold the common people who have supported their organization. Now Jehovah sends his army of locusts, who go right over and through those walls with a message of deliverance; and thus God by his witnesses ‘opens the prisons to them that are bound’.—Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Every one of the “faithful and wise servant” class knows that the Lord’s command, as applied to him, assigns to him a specific work, and therefore he goes forward attending to his own business, doing with his might what has been assigned to him, and does not interfere with the other fellow’s business. He knows that individually he has no strength, and therefore he does not become heady. He realizes that he is small in himself but strong in the Lord and, like the description of the locusts, he is “little . . . but . . . wise”, and like a band of locusts all such go forward as one united band of warriors: “There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise; . . . The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands.”—Prov. 30:24,27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> The Hierarchy and allies, all of whom are enemies of God’s kingdom, try to break up the unity and harmonious action of Jehovah’s witnesses, but they cannot do so. Therefore says God’s prophet concerning those faithful and zealous locusts: “They . . . shall not change their paths.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Those of the “faithful and wise servant” class have this one thing to do. (Phil. 3:13) That one thing is to carry out God’s commandment concerning them. They are trustworthy, constant, dependable, and reliable. They know that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are their teachers and commanders and that it is their business as servants of the Lord to joyfully obey: “Thine eyes shall see thy teachers; and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when [lest] ye turn to the right hand, and when [lest] ye turn to the left.”—Isa. 30: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The Lord has brought to pass facts which show that the present is the time of the fulfillment of this part of Joel’s prophecy. Only recently the Lord revealed to his people that the organization of Jehovah on earth, as well as in heaven, is theocratic and that Christ Jesus, as Jehovah’s great Executive Officer, is in charge and that now is the time when individual things or selfish desires should be and must be put entirely away and when everyone must bend his efforts to know and to do the will of God. Since the beginning of 1939 the “strange work” of Jehovah has progressed in the earth far more than at previous times, and greater is the joy of the workers. The Lord’s “other sheep” are coming in flocks to the corral, and these quickly see their privileges of joining in the work of proclaiming the King and kingdom. The reports that are regularly received from the field workers show a tremendous increase in the work during the time beginning and following January, 1939. True, the opposition everywhere increases, and the Lord gives his servants greater strength to surmount those difficulties. The faithful servants of the Lord now in the field have ever increasing and corroborative evidence that they are marching rapidly to Armageddon and that the day of final decision is at hand, and as they go forward their joy increases. Are the “other sheep” or “great multitude” being gathered? The “evil servant” class see it not. Behold the coming of the “great multitude”, marching shoulder to shoulder with the remnant of the anointed.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>FIFTH TRUMPET</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S greatest “Star” is Jesus the beloved. Numbers 24:17,19 foretold: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that rcmaincth of the city.” This prophecy must have a complete fulfillment in God’s due time. The “fifth angel” which the apostle John saw in the visions of The Revelation was now due to sound his trumpet, and we mark fulfillment of the prophecy now.-Rev. 8:6; 9:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We want to believe, we must believe, and we do believe that the Lord directs the course of his people who are wholly devoted to him. (Pss. 32:8; 48:14; 73:24; Isa. 58:11) A convention of God’s devoted people assembled in London, England, in May, 1926. For years prior thereto Bible students had thought that “that servant” mentioned in Bible prophecy was an individual man. But now, there at London a discourse entitled “The Servant and Service”, based upon Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter forty-nine, disclosed for the first time to God’s assembled people the true meaning of “The Servant”. A resolution entitled “A Testimony to the Rulers of the World” was then introduced. It was supported by a public address delivered at Royal Albert Hall and entitled “Why World Powers Are Tottering”. The morning following the adoption of that resolution, “A Testimony,” and the delivery of the supporting argument, a daily paper of London published a full report of both, and more than a million copies were put in the hands of the people that day, and later upward of fifty million copies were published in many languages and distributed throughout the world. At the same convention the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font3"> which exposes the Devil’s organization, was released internationally. The Lord’s people began to see and appreciate, as they had not previously, the two opposing organizations, God’s and the Devil’s, and the privilege that God’s anointed ones have in being his witnesses and servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“A TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the Rulers of the World .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The International Bible Students in general convention assembled declare their unqualified allegiance and devotion to the Almighty God, and believing it to be their privilege and duty so to do, in obedience to the commandments of God, send this testimony to the governing powers of the world, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“First. That it is of paramount importance that all recognize that Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the true and almighty God besides whom there is none other; that his purpose for man is set forth in the Bible, which is his Word of truth, and that Christ Jesus is the Executor of Jehovah’s purpose; that it is now apparent to all that the nations of the world are in dire distress and perplexity, and great trouble more terrible than any heretofore experienced is now threatened; that the efforts of the rulers to establish a desirable government or world power have failed; and, now be it known unto you, that the outworking of God’s purpose concerning man, and that alone, can and will stabilize the world, and bring lasting peace, prosperity and happiness to the peoples, and that the time has come for those who are exercising governing power over the peoples to recognize these great truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Second. That the reason for the prevailing condition of perplexity and distress is because man disobeyed the true God and yielded to the wicked influence of Satan, the false god; that Lucifer, originally the rightful overlord of man, because of his disloyalty to God became Satan the Devil, the instigator of all evil, and the adversary of God, and the arch enemy of man; that the evil one alienated man from the true God, and caused him to sin, by reason of which man lost his perfect home and his right to life and happiness ; that since then man has organized governments and world powers in an attempt to govern himself, but in so doing has ignored the Word of God and submitted to the control of Satan the Devil; that until now God has not interfered with Satan, to the end that man might be free to choose right or wrong. But now the time has come when God will interfere in behalf of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Third. That Christ Jesus, by his faithfulness unto death, became the Redeemer and Deliverer of mankind; that when on earth he taught that the time for the deliverance of the people would begin when the evil world under the rulcrship of Satan shall end, and that he, Christ Jesus, </span><span class="font3">would return and set up God’s kingdom of righteousness that the peoples might know and follow the right way; and for this reason he taught his followers to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as in heaven’; that in the meantime world powers have been organized and carried on for the purpose of ruling and controlling the peoples, and these world powers are designated in the Scriptures under the symbol ‘beast’ for the evident reason that they are the result of the combined efforts of the commercial, political and ecclesiastical leaders of men and are influenced and dominated by Satan, the god of this world, and have been, and are, military, harsh, cruel and oppressive, and manifest the spirit of Satan, their invisible ruler, or god; and now the repeated cries of oppressed humanity have reached unto the God of heaven, who will hear and deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fourth. That divine prophecy now fulfilled, and in the course of fulfillment, bears testimony to the fact that Satan’s lease of power is done, and that the old world has ended, and that the time is at hand when Christ Jesus, the executive officer of Jehovah and the rightful King of earth, will oust Satan the evil one and begin His righteous government, which shall establish God’s will on earth; that beginning with 1914 divine prophecy in the course of fulfillment gave testimony that the end of the evil world had begun in fhis, to wit, the World War, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, revolutions, . . . and later followed by general distress and perplexity of the nations of the world; that, this testimony of the fulfillment of the divine prophecy having been plainly given to the governing powers of the world, there is placed upon the shoulders of the rulers a responsibility that cannot be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fifth. That although Jehovah God furnished conclusive proof that the evil world had ended and that the time for the reign of his beloved Son had come, yet this testimony was ignored and pushed aside by those who should have known better; and contrary to the Word of God the commercial, political and ecclesiastical rulers attempted to stabilize the world and keep the peoples under control by adopting that makeshift which is called the League of Nations and which was wrongfully and blasphemously hailed as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth; that the real author and father of the League of Nations compact is Satan the Devil, the god of this world, which was put forward by him as his last desperate effort to deceive the peoples, turn them away from the true God, and hold them under his own wicked control; that now after seven years of laborious effort on the part of the proponents of that compact to establish peace and prosperity, it is practically conceded that the League of Nations is a complete failure and that its utter collapse is a matter of only a brief space of time; that even now while its advocates are striving to re-assemble their forces to maintain that disintegrating and unholy alliance, the people are hearing the solemn warning of God’s prophet concerning the federation, saying ‘Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand.’—Isa. 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Sixth. That by reason of the blinding influence of </span><span class="font3">Satan the minds of the rulers and the ruled are turned away from the true God, and the evil forces are gathering the whole world unto the great battle of the Lord God Almighty; that there is now impending a time of trouble such as the world has never known, during which conflict Satan’s powerful organization shall fall never to rise again, and there shall be such a demonstration of divine power that all the nations will learn that Jehovah is God and that Christ Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Seventh. That the great tribulation will reveal to the people the kingdom of God, which kingdom shall rest upon the shoulder of his beloved Son the Prince of Peace, and of the peace of that kingdom there shall be no end: it will bring the heart’s desire of all the people of good will, and in that kingdom the blind ignorance with which the people have long been afflicted will be for ever removed and with the knowledge of and obedience to God there shall come to the people everlasting peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and happiness; and that the kingdom will be the complete fulfillment of the prophetic song of the angels, ‘Peace on earth, good will toward men.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Therefore we earnestly bear before you this testimony: That Jehovah is The God, and that he has installed Christ his Son, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The King</span><span class="font3"> of the earth, and bids you to give full obedience to earth’s rightful King. Do so and use your influence to turn the minds of the people to THE TRUE GOD, that disaster may not befall you.—Ps. 2: 2-12.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning the vision foreshadowing this John says: “And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit [abyss].” (Rev. 9:1) The proper identification of this star will be the key to the understanding of the prophecy. Undoubtedly that star is Christ Jesus, of whom 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says: “The Lord himself shall descend [come down] from heaven . . . with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.” The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott </span><span class="font3">version renders the words of Revelation 9:1, “A Star having fallen from the heaven to the earth”; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham’s</span><span class="font3"> version renders them, “A star out of heaven fallen unto the earth.” The fall, as stated in this text, does not denote something bad. Rather the thought is that the star has come down from heaven to earth. Coming from his exalted position to earth is best represented by the word “fall” or “descend”, as concerns a star. The thought might well be expressed that this mighty Star here and now condescended, descended or came down to give attention to things pertaining to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of Revelation 9:1, “to him was given the key of the bottomless pit [or, abyss],” definitely identify the Star as Christ Jesus. (See Revelation 1:18; 20:1.) No one but Christ Jesus is given the key to the bottomless pit, or abyss; hence the Star mentioned must be the Lord Jesus Christ himself. At his death he went into the abyss, or &quot;pit”, but God brought him up therefrom; and having gained this victory over death he would be the one properly entrusted with the key thereto. (Ps. 16:10; Aets 3:15) The “star” mentioned could not be Satan; because, if so, then he would have the key to let himself out of that pit. The divine record is that Jesus will open the bottomless pit at the end of the thousand years of His reign and let Satan out for a short season; and Jesus opens that pit or abyss for the sleeping saints to come out in due time. When Jesus was on the earth he, and none other, had received authority over the abyss or pit. (Luke 8:30-33, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font3"> version, shows this.) These scriptures identify Jesus as the Star, beyond any question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record is that when this mighty Star came down from heaven “he opened the bottomless pit [or abyss], and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit”. (Rev. 9:2) The smoke ascending as from a great furnace is a precursor of destruction coming from that source which is controlled only by Jehovah and his Christ. It therefore symbolically pictures destruction. Likewise the Scriptures (James 3: 6) describe the unruly tongue, set on fire, as one of destruction. The “whirlwind”, which the prophet Ezekiel saw (1:4), was a symbol of the same thing. As further proof that the “smoke” is a symbol of coming destruction God’s prophet (Mal. 4:1) wrote: “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.” Revelation 9:2: “And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.” Symbolically this says: ‘The time has come to proclaim the vengeance of Jehovah God against the enemy’s organization.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The resolution adopted at London, above mentioned as “A Testimony to the Rulers of the World”, and the supporting message, was the preaching of the Word of God concerning his vengeance, and giving the reason for the impending fall of the world powers. This was not the message of man or men, but the message of the Lord’s Word which God through his angels, without a doubt, directed should be spoken. We must therefore conclude that the angel of the Lord directs the movements of God’s organization in obedience to the command coming from “the higher powers”, Jehovah and Christ. (Rom. 13:1) The message contained in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font3"> released at the same time, was a more detailed description of Satan’s organization and God’s organization preparing for battle. These messages especially make mention that the name of Jehovah is exalted and expose the wickedness of the enemy organization. These great truths of Jehovah therefore caused “the brightness of the firmament [of Satan]” to be “darkened”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As to smoke, the prophet Isaiah, giving a description of the Lord in his temple, says: “And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried [to the seraphim], and the house was filled with smoke.” (Isa. 6:4) Thus the glory of the Lord appeared, filling his temple. The proclamation of this message of truth began to put Satan and his cohorts in the shade. The army of the Lord is now mustered for service, and concerning that army and what accompanies it from the Lord his Word says (Joel 2:10,11, 30): “The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining; and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army; for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it? . . . And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.” Even the Devil’s organization began to take notice that something undesirable was approaching. The &quot;smoke” and that which came out of it worried the Devil’s agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What came out? John describes &quot;locusts” as coming out of the smoke upon the earth and that there was given to them power or authority “as the scorpions of the earth have power”. (Rev. 9:3) These locusts could not symbolize Satan’s servants, but they do symbolically represent the servants of Jehovah God. Verse eleven of this same chapter of Revelation says concerning the locusts: “And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.” This shows that the locusts symbolize an organized band or company going forth under their supreme commander; and other scriptures identify Jesus Christ as that King and Commander and the Head of the elect servant of God. The “locusts” therefore must represent God’s faithful remnant of witnesses on earth. The remnant do as 1 Peter 2:17 says, “honor the King.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “Abaddon” is derived from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">abad</span><span class="font3"> and means “Destroying One”, and is applied to Jehovah and his Executioner; for Jehovah is the One that is “able to save and to destroy”. Jehovah destroys them that hate him. (Deut. 7:10) Many Scripture texts apply this Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">abad</span><span class="font3"> to Jehovah relative to destruct ion. For example, Ezekiel 28:16: “I [Jehovah] will destroy thee [Satan], 0 covering cherub.” Obadiah 8: “Shall I not in that day [the day of the Lord], saith the Lord, even destroy </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[abad]</span><span class="font3"> the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau [Satan’s organization] ?” To the same effect it is written, at Micah 5:10: “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots.” Jehovah’s faithful remnant of witnesses on earth liow declare the coming execution of Jehovah’s judgments of destruction upon Satan’s organization at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED IN GRAND PROCLAMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s mercy endureth forever! We, his people gathered for organization instructions of the theocratic government at the zone assembly at Mattoon, Illinois, praise and bless him, for he has richly extended his mercy unto us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s “strange work” now brings forcibly to the attention of the people his purpose to destroy all the wicked, visible and invisible, at Armageddon. We are joyful to be united with you in this grand proclamation. You have been an inspiration to us by means of the powerful denunciation of the tactics of the visible parts of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah’s Battle,” the present testimony period, gives to us increased opportunities to praise our Almighty God and to “make mention that his name is exalted”, as the prophet states. Individually as members of this assembly, numbering 73, we declare ourselves for Jehovah and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. We pray that our opportunities to serve may be increased through Jehovah’s favor and that we shall be on the alert to grasp and use such privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this letter we send our love to you. We love you greatly for your manifest devotion to our loving heavenly Father. We thank and praise him as the ‘giver of all good gifts’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL PRAISE TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mv </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just a few lines to let you know how much I enjoy reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and all the Society’s publications. Also want to thank and praise Jehovah that it was through your publications I was brought to a knowledge of the truth. I haven’t been in the truth quite a year, but this has been the happiest time of my life. I wasted eighteen years in “Christendom”, but all praise to Jehovah for the privilege now of having a small part of spreading the good news of the kingdom message. When I received the truth I was not physically able to be up all day. I can now spend six or seven hours daily in house-to-house witnessing and feel ten years younger. I thank God for you, and may he bless all the workers at Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sincerely, yours in his service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEDIENT TO HIGHER POWERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second assembly of Pennsylvania Zone No. 1, held at Wilmington, Del., June 4, 1939, wishes to express thanks to Jehovah for the privilege of having part in His Theocratic Government, especially at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We wish to thank you for the much-needed admonition contained in your letter of January 1, to all Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Activity in the field has much increased in this zone and promises to increase much more. Many have already exceeded their 60 hours and back-call quotas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is our determination to be obedient to instructions coming from the Higher Powers, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, through their visible channel, the Society, and work together in peace and unity and we will endeavor to our utmost to properly guard ami advance the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are 495 present at this assembly, and many arc here for the first time; which is evidence that the Lord is gathering the “great multitude”. At the morning assembly for field service 392 were present, and 392 engaged in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are with you in the greatest battle of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH THE GREAT GIVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was with joy that I received the January 1 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> The bright new cover harmonizes beautifully with the ever-increasing brightness of the truth revealed in its pages, and gives us strength to press on in the service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have never read a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> article so plain, so convincing and strengthening, as “Deliverance Guaranteed”, which is evidence that the same message is particularly important for the great multitude; and this is an incentive now to carry </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">to them as a kingdom publication. Anyone reading that article must truly acknowledge Jehovah as the great Giver. As 1 read it it made me glad and grateful beyond words that I mn on Jehovah’s side, and I pray that, by his grace, I remain there for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With you wholeheartedly in Jehovah’s “strange work”, knowing full well “They shall not prevail against thee”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO JEHOVAH ALL GLORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As again one month has elapsed, we are sending you our Bethel study report for May, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have now studied Parts 2 and 3 of “Drama of Vindication”. This is a very mighty drama which we have with admiration watched. The faith of Rahab and her eagerness to seek the Lord’s approval is quite touching, and the crossing of Jordan was followed with strained attention by us as we saw the miracle performed by the Lord. And when we come to the fulfillment, there are no words with which to express our delight. The mutual care of each other among the remnant and great multitude has especially been impressed upon us. And as we look on the ‘pile of stones in the midst of the river’, we do it overjoyed and glad for having some part in bearing and piling of them by the Lord’s grace, without which we could do nothing like that. To him we are giving all glory, for we know that it is a miracle, performed by him and for his holy name. It is a miracle that we are in Canaan, where the fight is going on, and we will, by the Lord’s help through his organization, continue to fight with you in his victorious army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With warm greetings and asking God’s richest blessings upon you, we are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bethel Family, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Helsinki.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BLESSING OF JEHOVAH MAKETH RICH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Loving greetings in the name of our victorious King 1 Because my heart is overflowing with gratitude to Jehovah for the great privilege of standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this the greatest battle of all time, and because I am fully aware of the fact that the enemy organization is aiming all its darts at you, I feel it is not only a privilege, but a Christian duty, to express to you my fervent love and perhaps say something that will bring joy and comfort to your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By appointing you as the visible leader in his mighty theocratic arrangement Jehovah has conferred upon you an honor the like of which has never before been accorded to any man. I rejoice with you in the great honor thus conferred. Moreover, I am firmly convinced that Jehovah has thus honored you because of the fullness of your unselfish devotion to him in the performance of your commission. Your great faith in Jehovah God is manifest </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font3"> everything you do, and your undaunted courage in the face of danger is a source of constant inspiration to every one of God’s true people. Your enemies, and they are legion, hate you with a perfect hatred, but your true and loyal friends, and they are in the small minority, love you in a manner “passing the love.of women”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The joy of being associated with you and sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name increases every hour of every day. This joy is enhanced by the ever-increasing evidence that the members of the great multitude are rapidly waking up and are beginning to join with us in the song of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Words fail to express the deep sense of satisfaction that wells up in my heart as I daily engage in the pioneer work among the businessmen of Boston. For this I am deeply grateful to Jehovah. Every day is replete with from six to eight outstanding experiences that thrill my heart through and through. Because I am so “unwise” (1) as to associate myself with such a man as “that man Rutherford” the Devil sees to it that plenty of abuse is heaped upon me too; but, thank God, I have learned long since to take it fight on the chin and glory in tribulations.—Rom. 5: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In closing I cannot fail to express to you my thankfulness to Jehovah for the “strong meat” we are constantly getting in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles. The dazzling splendor of the beauty of the priceless gems of truth now being revealed to God’s faithful people surpasses the power of imagination.—Job 38: 22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am proud, and happy indeed, to be associated with “that man Rutherford”, who has proved by his works of righteousness that he is a true and faithful witness to the honor and praise of the Most High God, Jehovah. It is my daily prayer that our loving Father, Jehovah, will continue to guide you in your work and give you added strength and heavenly wisdom in the stirring days just ahead. Now that the theocratic government of the great God, Jehovah, is in operation in the earth, I firmly believe we may expect to see him crack down on the Devil’s organization in very short order by an outstanding expression of his righteous judgments about to be executed against that wicked outfit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This letter carries to you my fervent love and renewed assurance of joyful co-operation in the promotion of the kingdom interests. May the blessing of Jehovah that maketh rich be your constant portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and fellow servant in the service of the King Eternal,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THANK JEHOVAH FOR GRANTING LIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three months ago I too was a prisoner in the Church of England, and I shall never be able to thank Jehovah enough for granting me the light of his Word through your books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having the disadvantage of a college education, we were taught there was no Devil, and the book of Genesis was winked at. How I enjoyed reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Creation!</span><span class="font3"> which solved so many problems for me—what is more snobbish than a public-school girl! The Church of England was such good style! And, of course, the Church of Rome was really </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When my husband read your books and the truth was revealed to him, he was on the church council, many church con<sup>1</sup>-mittees, an officer in the Hereford Regiment, a member of the Druids, British Legion, and many other things. Of course, when he gave up everything for the work, I, strongly supported by the entire town, thought he was qualifying for the local asylum. Yes, the Devil sent me strong delusions, and many of his followers to cheer me up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was not until many months of great misery and after praying to God that if Bill was right I should see the truth, that it was revealed to me in a blinding flash in the middle of a page of the Armageddon booklet (which I confess I had stolen from his car, where he left his books after I had burnt the first he brought home). It was as clear as the pebbles at the bottom of a clear stream, and I shall try and thank God for giving me this great understanding by in a small way repaying Him by doing all I can to help in his work; and happily we are spending every moment we can in joy at kingdom interests; children and house and friends (which are now only Jehovah’s witnesses) take a second place. Bill is company servant of the Ross and Hereford companies, and we hope to be granted time before Armageddon to prove our love for Jehovah and his great King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My small son, aged 7, loves the work and, too, the banner marches. When accidentally the wireless had been switched on at a service the other day and the parson was saying, “Good Lord, deliver us,” he switched off the set with great deliberation and said, “Yes, and they’ll need it.” The baby of three is very good, too, and comes out with me on the work and enjoys it, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We love the “Face the Facts” records, and they fill us with a great desire to drop everything and find the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thanks to Jehovah that we have you to help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CALIFORNIA PRIEST LISTENS UNDER DURESS AND DIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The phonograph was set up, but before it was played the housewife requested that the Kingdom publishers wait for a few minutes. She went out the front door and returned in a few minutes with a priest from the ehureh across the street. Latching the screen door, she turned to the priest and said: 'Now, let me see you do what you told us to do. Break up their phonograph and tear up their literature.’ Greatly embarrassed, of course, was the priest and began wringing his hands, and said: ‘You took me too seriously; I didn’t mean what I said.’ The woman replied: ‘Then you don’t mean anything you say in church. You just sit down and listen to this record.’ The priest sat, and as soon as the lecture was finished he made a hasty exit. The publishers remained and found that the woman was really fed up on the church and was looking for the truth. Result: Another back-call series is now being held at her home. An interesting sequel to all this happened within a week: The priest died of heart failure very suddenly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CATHOLIC BRITON MEETS UP WITH INFORMATION MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Looking after a little girl while the mother was in the information march, and walking alongside on the pavement, she was approached by a gentleman who inquired what it was about, said he was a Catholic and had been looking for this all his life, admitted that religion is a snare and a racket, and promised to attend the local meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DOORSTEP METHOD” IN ENGLAND (ZONE 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A young man at a fairly large modern house was rather surprised and greatly interested when a publisher called on him and started to set the phonograph up on the doorstep. He asked her to explain more fully what she was doing. On being told the purpose of the work he asked her inside. The recording ‘Enemies’ appealed to him very much, and he asked many questions about the message and also about the phonograph work. He remarked he had never seen such a fine method of presentation before, and he would certainly have some of the books. He contributed 10/- to the work and took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and gave a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT VERDUN IN QUEBEC PROVINCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sunday morning the publisher called at a Catholic home. Asked in, he played the record ‘Prince of Peace’. The woman told her husband to put him out. Husband told wife the message was good. Then the publisher told them this work must be done, showing them Matthew 24:14, then Jeremiah 17:5, telling them not to trust in man, but to trust in the Lord, and ‘religion is of the Devil’. Then the wife phoned for the police. Five minutes later the police arrived. She told the police to arrest him. The police asked: ‘What has he done ?’ She told the police: ‘He said religion is of the Devil.’ Policeman: ‘The priests are preaching today, Sunday, and I have no more right to arrest him than the priest.’ The publisher then repeated to the police what he had already said to those in the house. The woman then invited the publisher and policeman to the parlor, where they discussed the Truth for 25 minutes more. The woman gave the publisher an address of her uncle and stated he is very interested in these books. So the publisher has a back-call and will call around to see the woman again after he has gotten in touch with the uncle. The police of Verdun are with us, and so is the chief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RIGHT AROUND HOME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I have been ill and felt very much discouraged, being out of the service for some time. This morning I worked the territory near my home. I just went around one block and in that one block I got four back-calls, two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions, and placed a book and eight booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS SOUND-CAR DRIVER WAS NOT BLUFFED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The sound-car was giving the lectures ‘Relief’ and ‘Resolution’ in Cape May Court House (N. J.). A man came up with a big car and told me to stop, saying: ‘Stop this lecture, because you are under arrest and 90 days in jail and some money to pay.’ I asked: ‘Who are you ?’ He replied he was So-and-so. I asked to see his badge. He said he left it at home. So I told him to go and get it. Then he said he would break the record to pieces on the sound equipment. I said: ‘If you have $10,000 and if Jehovah permits you yet, well, go ahead. This is the United States, not Germany; not Hitler nor Hierarchy rules.’ He said: “Are you going to stay here ?’ I said: ‘Never mind. Keep going!’ He left.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">USING THE JAPANESE RECORD ON PACIFIC COAST</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At one place a man was standing by a fence. So I set the phonograph up and began to play the record. Two women in a house 300 feet away heard it and came out to listen. At another place I did not see anyone around and no one came in response to a knock at the door. So I set up the phonograph and started playing, and there were six of them who stuck their heads out and began listening.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BACK-CALL SQUAD IN LONDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The London N.W. unit of Jehovah’s witnesses have organized a back-call squad whose duty it is each week to thoroughly witness in a specific area with the phonograph and obtain back-calls, so that the people of good will may be called upon. This method has just been put into operation, and it is found that the unit now averages more than one back-call per publisher per week. In February 193S they reported 63 publishers in the field. In February 1939. 114 publishers were reported in the field; an increase of 51 publishers in 12 months. This has been accomplished by establishing model studies, then transferring after a time to a study of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font3"> At Denham, Bucks, a pub lishcr established a model study in his own home for the benefit of two of his relatives and a neighbor. The numbers increased in the course of a few weeks, until 12 to 14 were regularly attending. Following the model study an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font3">study commenced. The numbers at the class are still in creasing, and the publisher is setting a good lead by going into the field with them. All the surrounding territory has been well worked with the sound-car, phonograph and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> booklets. The interested ones who attend this study are all engaging regularly in the field work. They find eve ning a most suitable time to engage in the work. From re ports handed in new publishers are reported almost every week. The above area has been worked consistently for a number of years. The books and booklets have always been placed freely, but, in the past, time was not given to the people’s needs.”</span></p>

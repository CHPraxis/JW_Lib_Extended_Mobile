<p><span class="font15">A Mighty Catholic in the “Pit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N THE two preceding issues of Consolation the infamy of Martin T. Manton which resulted in his conviction and sentence to prison June 1939 for “selling justice”, and his earlier conspiracy to keep eight innocent men in prison during the stormy years of 1918-19, was reviewed. Those who know Manton’s career as revealed in his trial and •conviction for accepting $186,000 in bribes for six decisions were not surprised to learn how he conspired with other high Catholics to keep Judge Rutherford and seven other Christians in the Atlanta penitentiary for nine months by refusing them bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Manton gave no reason for refusing them bail. When the case finally came before himself, Ward and Rogers, justices of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, and the judgment was reversed by the prevailing opinion of Ward and Rogers, Manton </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">dissented.</span><span class="font8"> Although not required to do so, he also submitted an opinion. The readers will be interested in this opinion, which is reproduced in detail in this issue, showing how more than twenty years ago the “commercial judge” was determined to do the will of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nor is this merely one past chapter in the misdeeds of a criminal. In passing it might be noted, and this without criticism of the officiating judge, that while Manton is now by continuance of his bail permitted to enjoy his Long Island home of luxurious comfort and spend the thousands he extorted from other Americans whom he blackmailed, when Manton himself was confronted by innocent Christians seeking bail he consigned them to the rigors of prison. But even this inequality of justice is not the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manton a Mere Stooge</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The significant fact for Americans, both Protestant and Catholic, to note is thi^: The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 8, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hierarchy used Manton to keep these </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wrongfully in prison for nine months, and to this day they denounce Judge Rutherford as an “ex-eonvict”, which&quot;he was not; yet their presses are now silent at the conviction of Manton, “Knight of St. Gregory the Great,” who reduced the appellate bench to a court of blackmail. With this amazing opportunity before them the Roman Catholic press might come forward with an editorial decrying the abuses of this honored member of the church, but they do not. The American people are thus left to the assumption that the Romanists do not approve the punishment of a Catholic, be he blackmailer, briber or thief. What say you, Hierarchy of Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy claim infallibility in matters of jurisdiction, and, no doubt, had Manton been tried in their courts he would have been acquitted and made a Knight of some other the-Great. However, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> submits the only infallible rule of injunctions to judges, that found in God’s Word of truth, the Bible, as evidence that the American Constitution, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font8"> church authority, approximates the Lord’s commands as touching judiciary conduct. Some of those who figured prominently in Manton’s conviction, Attorney General Murphy, U. S. Prosecutor John T. Cahill, Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, and Chief of “G-Men”, Edgar Hoover, even though they are not commended by the Catholic ehurch, their course of action is approved by the great King of Justice; and this is shown by the scriptures which follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Thou shait not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">will not justify the wicked. And thou shait take no gift; for the gift blindeth the wise, and pervert-eth the words of the righteous.”—Exodus 23: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Judges and officers shaft thou make thee in all thy gates, which [Jehovah] thy God. give th thee* throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment. Thou ehalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live.”—Deuteronomy 16: 18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men; in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.”—Psalm 26: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shut-teth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high.”—Isaiah 33:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.”—Amos 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Canon Law of the Catholic Church assumes an authority much higher than the mere Word of God just quoted. The tradition of men, and not the Bible, is their authority for Canon 2341, which provides that anyone who sues a bishop or cardinal is automatically excommunicated. Canon 120 provides that the clergy may be tried only in ecclesiastical courts; no judgment can be rendered against the Canon Law (paragraph 461) ; jurors are bound to absolve the defendants in such cases, and'are to affirm that the crime of the cleric is not proved. Penalties to the clergy must be benignant. (Canon 2219) The judge cannot , increase the prescribed penalty. (Canon 2223) Suspended sentences are prescribed, even where penalties are designated. (Canon 2233) Jesus condemns the traditions of men contrary to the law of God, according to Matthew 15:3; nor is it possible to find a more glaring example of following the tradition of men than by rendering partial judgments in favor of the persons of clerics or other men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even as the “Church” profited in Manton’s ill-gotten wealth, so it must share in the ignominy of his disgrace. For an organization that approves a system of obtaining money under false pretenses, such as that involved in “purgatory prayers”, must of necessity share the condemnation of a son who models his court practices on the teachings of the Catholic Church of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judge Manton’s Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The high honors bestowed upon Manton by the Roman Catholic Church were never modified by a word of censure upon his villainous conduct. Nor is it to be expected of the church which has spawned Catherine de Medici, “Bloody” Mary, Al Caponi, Franco “The Butcher”, Hitler and Mussolini, to mention only a few of the most “illustrious”. Far from condemning his conduct, one of the agents of the Hierarchy, a priest, was the first person to call on the “commercial judge” after he had been arrested. And one of Manton’s last acts in office was to receive in his chambers “Reverend Father” William E. Cashin, of the nearby St. Andrews Roman Catholic Church, where Red Mass for the Judiciary is held annually. Is not the “Church” which thus approves him, as well as Manton himself, weighed in the balance and found wanting? When an innocent man who had criticized the “Church” was wrongfully condemned, 0 Hierarchy, your merciless and fiendish laughs were heard from pole to pole. Now, when the product of your teachings, the ideal. of Papal training, has been sentenced as a felon, what say you, Hierarchy of Rome ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manton Makes a Pile</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his position as the tenth ranking judge of the United States (next to the nine on the Supreme Court) Manton made at one time over a million dollars. He should have been content with his salary of $12,500 a year, as set out in the code of ethics of the American Bar Association, Canons 4, 24, 26 and 32. On this point President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is repugnant to our sense of the proper administration of justice that judges should be 'permitted to engage in business during their terms of office. This principle admits of no doubt and should be applied throughout the State. • ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Business was good at first, and Manton at one time considered himself worth over $1,000,000. Then things began to slip, and on two consecutive days in July, 1938, complaints came in io the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram </span><span class="font8">office that Manton was sitting in cases that involved lawyers or litigants from whom the judge or his associates had obtained financial bepefits such as loans. This evidence came into<sup>: </sup>the hands of District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey. He made an investigation, and found that six of the loans totaled $439,481.44, which is considerable change for a.Federal judge to take in on the side. In all, it is reported that Manton had twenty-five corporations on ..the string, among them the American Tobacco Co.: and Warner Brothers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; &lt;&nbsp;T <sup>r</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V ■ ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After Twenty-one Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For twentymne years the Roman Catholic press has raved ■ approval of Manton’s refusal to grant bail to Judge Rutherford and his companions, which refusal he twice executed by order, July 1 and July 12, 1918. As a con- . sequence these men spent nine months in the Atlanta penitentiary. When admitted to bail by order of the Supreme Court of the United States they were released and acquitted. This incarceration which Manton forced upon these Christians pending their new trial and acquit -tai is the basis upon which the Roman Catholic Church has libelously called Judge Rutherford an “ex-convict” for twenty-one years. Even the flagrance of this injustice is not the most important thing. But when an organization lauds a felon and persecutes a Christian and at the same time claims to be the representative of Christ the people should be told that their claims are false, and their lie is open for all men to see. What say you, Hierarchy of Rome ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In times past anybody who offended the Papal organization was branded “heretic”, a term which in Catholic usage has meaning similar to the word “unpatriotic”, namely, a critic of Romanism. Their fertility in coining false and inconsistent charges and hurling them at an opponent is amazing. For instance, most, of the Protestant martyrs were burned for disputing the authority of the pope, and this was claimed to be punishment for attacking God’s representative. But the lechery and bestiality of these same popes was never for a moment questioned, just as today the felony of Manton is tacitly approved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In their efforts to dispose of Judge Rutherford their inconsistency has had no bounds. ' During the war he was accused of having “Hun” sympathies; at this day he is denounced as an anti-German Nazi; on occasion in Switzerland he was reported by agents of Rome to have been the trial judge in the famous conviction of the Communists Sacco and Vanzetti, and he narrowly escaped death from a rioting band of Communists; an article in the Hierarchy’s Brooklyn Tablet says his speeches, are “Communism in another dress”;-in Madrid he was very nearly murdered by a mob who said he was a “Jesuit” (this rumor was undoubtedly circulated by a Jesuit); in Germany the cry was “Kill that Jew”; in Lisbon, “Shoot that anti-Communist.” If you ■ are a Catholic arid accept without examination whatever is told you by a priest, which of .; these stories do you believe? The Hierarchy’s real charge against Judge Rutherford they dare not make ; that he is a Christian and therefore, as a true follower of Jesus Christ, uncompromisingly opposed to their hypocrisy and wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For many years </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> has been saving a page for the answer of the Hierarchy to these charges. This page is still blank, but the paper is becoming somewhat yellow from age. What says the gentle reader, shall we throw it away?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Leopard’s Whelp</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a Catholic is elevated to the distinguished position of “Knight of St. Gregory the Great” he must have overcome all weakness that might lead him to prefer principle to the interests of the Catholic Church. He must be a true whelp of the leopard, with all the spots and never a flaw. Such a man was found in Man ton, but he must be tested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy noted with gleeful approval that he twice refused bail to the eight Christians they were determined to destroy. But in the spring of 1919, and even before, seven hundred thousand letters were flooding Wash- . ington and the trial judge, Howe, had wired his recommendation for “commutation”, hoping thus to cast off some of the ignominy of his prejudiced conduct of the trial; eminent lawyers and officials, such as Governor Selzer, of New York, Senator Hiram Johnson, and Senator Tom Watson, were offering their services free to correct this odious miscarriage of justice. The appeal was certain to come before Rogers, Ward and Manton because the Supreme Court of the United States had ordered bail. What would the leopard’s whelp do now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was not until some time thereafter that Manton was created “Knight of St. Gregory the Great” by Papal decree. But he established his record for wicked prejudice in his dissent- ’ ing opinion which affirmed.judgment in a trial, with 125 errors. The spawn of the leopard never changes its spots! His vote was nullified by the prevailing opinion of Judges Rogers and Ward reversing the judgment, but Manton had distinguished himself for the Hierarchy. The record of this appeal and Manton’s amazing opinion, which has on occasions since been produced as evidence to prejudice against Judge Rutherford, is set forth below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Action of the Court of Appeals</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When bail had finally teen allowed, after</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">their imprisonment for nine months because Manton refused to grant bail (in great contrast to the manner in which Judge W. Calvin Chesnut, of Catholic Baltimore, continued Manton’s own bail even after conviction), the ease came before Judges Ward, Rogers and Manton. This appeal is described in detail in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherford et al.</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">U. 8.,</span><span class="font8"> Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. May 14, 1919. Federal Reporter, Vol. 258, Criminal Law 657, Trial No. 239. The decision of the lower court was reversed in the majority opinion by Justices Rogers and Ward. From that opinion the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In error to the District Court of the U. S. for the Eastern District of N. Y. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph F. Rutherford and others were convicted of violating the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, Tit. 1, g.g. 3, 4, and they bring error. Reversed and remanded for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">opinion of ward, cncurr judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is a writ of error to a judgment of conviction of the defendants, eight in number, indicted . for violation of section </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">’ 3</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font7"> title 1, of the Espionage Act of June 15,1917. . . . Seven of the defendants were sentenced to terms of twenty years [on each of four counts of the indictment, the sentence to commence and run concurrently, and “that they stand committed until the sentence is complied with”, a total of eighty years each!] and the eighth to a term of ten years in the federal penitentiary of Atlanta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Ward recounted some of the prejudicial actions of the trial court, many examples of which appear in the record. An actual count discloses 125 different errors committed in the trial court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He concluded his opinion with these words: “The </span><span class="font7">defendants in this case did not have the temperate and impartial trial to which they were entitled and for that reason the judgment was reversed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before taking up the dissenting opinion of Manton, which had no effect on the reversal of judgment, was unnecessary and quite evidently spiteful, it is interesting to note that even Howe, the tidal judge, had already admitted his harshness and lack of judicial temperance in a letter set out below dated at Burlington, Vermont, March 3, 1919:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Honorable Attorney General, Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sir:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The severe sentence of twenty years was imposed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- upon each of the defendants except De Ceeea. His was ten years. My principal purpose was to make an example, as a warning to others, and I believed that the President would release them after the war was over. As I said in my telegram, they did much damage, and it may well be claimed that they ought not to be set at liberty so soon, but as they cannot do any more harm now, I am in favor of being as lenient as I was severe in imposing sentence. I believe most of them were sincere, if not all, and I am not in favor of keeping such persons in confinement after their opportunity for making trouble is past. Their case has not yet been heard in the Circuit Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[Signed] Harland B. Howe, United States District Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also referring to some of this harshness where even the department of justice “said prisoners had been victims of war-time passion or prejudice”, a ■ dispatch widely published throughout the nation on March 5, 1919, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ASK CLEMENCY FOR EIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thousands of letters have been received by the department of justice asking executive clemency for J. F. Rutherford, head of the International Bible Students Association, and seven associates now serving sentences in the Atlanta federal prison on charges of disloyalty growing out of publication of the “Finished Mystery”, a Bible handbook. These cases were appealed by the convicted men from the federal district court in Brooklyn, and are pending in-the appellate court. Officials indicated that no action would be taken in their cases until the appellate court had rendered a decision. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Likewise a petition bearing 700,000 names had been presented at Washington. It will thus be seen that the rehearing of this ease and the subsequent reversal of judgment hardly came as a voluntary desire on the part of the officials to amend an error of justice, as they had all previously refused to allow bail. It came as a result of much public agitation of the subject, and it was doubtless fear of this publicity that prompted the abova-quoted letter and telegram of Harland B. Howe, who had originally tried the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The war was over. Nothing had been done by Rutherford and his fellow Christians to interrupt the war. They had only aided their brethren in filing application for exemption</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">under the Selective Draft Act. All the foregoing facts were before Manton and without any reason he filed a dissenting opinion insisting that the defendants should be kept in prison for the whole term of 80 years because of the publication of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery, </span><span class="font8">which book was written before the war began, v and no part of it being written by Rutherford. A book written by President Wilson before the war contained much stronger language than </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery.</span><span class="font8"> The salient part of Manton’s Opinion follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Manton, Circuit Judge. I dissent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The offenses charged were committed between June 16, 1917, and May 6, 1918. The corporations, acting through their officers and employes, who were indicted, between June 30, 1917, and March, 1918, caused to be published 850,000 copies of a book called “The Finished Mystery”, These copies were distributed in large numbers in the army camps of the United States, and many hundreds of thousands of copies were distributed throughout the United States and Canada, The book purported to be an interpretation of the Book of Revelations and the Book of Ezekiel, The book has taken the. shape of a small bible or prayer book. The first half is devoted to many quotation, with interpretations, from the Scriptures. Then, in about the eenter of the book, are found writings, placed there in a very insinuative manner, of which the following extracts are a type:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Standing opposite to those Satan has placed three great untruths, human immortality, the Antichrist and a certain delusion which is best described by the word Patriotism, but which is in reality murder, the spirit of the very Devil. . . . Under the guise of Patriotism the civil governments of earth demand of peace-loving men the sacrifice of themselves and their loved ones and the butchery of their fellows, and hail it as a duty demanded by the laws of heaven.&quot; Page 247.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;If you say that this war is a last resort in a situation which every other method, patiently tried, has failed to meet, I must answer that this is not true —that other ways and means of action, tried by experience and justified by success, have been laid before the administration and willfully rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;In its ultimate causes, this war is the natural product of our unchristian civilization. . , . There is not a question raised, an issue involved, a cause at stake, which is worth the life of one blue-jacket on the sea or one khaki-coat in the trenches. ’ ’ Page 251.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At about this stage, the fertile mind of the reader would be very much interested, if aanetimoniouH at all. At this stage, he is supplied this food of poison for his patriotism and loyalty to his country, Under the mockery of religion or religious teaching, I can conceive of no worse thrust at America and at America’s needs, at the time of the-publication of this book, than that which was published in this book by the defendants. We in </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">erica all accord'to men of all religious faiths the right to an honest and faithful belief in their creed and the practice of it accordingly, but that the defendants’ efforts were, intentional and for the desired purpose is apparent from a mere recital of some of the happenings during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I see no error warranting a reversal of this conviction in the conduct of the trial judge, and in my opinion the judgment should be affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Manton’s patriotic fervor as expressed in this opinion gives further light on the meaning of the word “patriotic” as used by distinguished Catholies. He found great dangers to the nation in the actions of true Christians, And he found no objection in his own ease to selling his judicial decisions for lucre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is a clear example of how eminent Catholics consider they should be immune to all restrictions as is decreed by Catholic canon law for their clerics. As no criticism has yet come from the Catholic press for Manton’s treacherous conduct, it must be assumed that these self-constituted guards of “patriotism” must approve his action. Of course, the laws of a country do not apply to an honored Catholic who takes his orders from Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus it appears that in 1919 Manton was already warped in the Jesuit school of bribery. A. leopard never changes its spots. Thus stamping on honor, justice, and truth Manton acted as the ideal servant of the Hierarchy and has their tacit approval to this day. The spots will never change, but perhaps a striped uniform will shortly in Manton’s ease form an appropriate “mark of distinction”.—Elton Groves.</span></p>

Drums of this aeid, made in Germany,'were brought to a point off Mexico by the German freighter Edna. There they were transferred to the Japanese fishing-boat Flying Cloud, and landed at Ensenada, ninety miles frotn San Diego, in June, 1937. Though watched day and night, one of these drums was'obtained three months after they landed. The aeid drums are twice as large as gasoline drums, and are lined with rubber.</span></p>

Mr. Lowe could not understand why anybody in Milwaukee should be paying more than 5c‘ a quart for milk for which the farmers were getting but 2c. If 5c’ would be a fair price iir Milwaukee, why do they charge 14e in Scranton? It is gravely to be suspected that farmers in the east get but little more than they do in Wisconsin, and that the public are paying more than twice a fair price for the milk they consume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">From Rangoon, Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font8">INCE July, 1938, we have had very unsettled conditions throughout Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">First </span><span class="font8">we had communal riots™-the Buddhists with the Mohammedans—over a book which a Mohammedan published about ten years ago putting forth several points to prove the superiority of the Moslem religion over the Buddhism. This only now seems to have upset “the religious susceptibilities&quot; of the Burmese; but that is an excuse. The real cause is political agitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After that the University students went on a strike and started picketing all the other schools. They were petty enough to smash a number of the street lights, with the result that many sections of Rangoon have been in pitch darkness. Little children are now induced by irresponsible leaders and “jobless politicians” to go on a hunger strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A number of cultivators have marched to Rangoon from far country places and are encamped at the slopes of the Shwe Dagon .Pagoda (the largest Buddhist cathedral in Burma), which is become the center of Hooliganism and politics. The monks are taking active lead in civil disobedience and occasional violence, such as caning old women and assaulting isolated people. Hooliganism reigneth in the land!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Burma was given her own government about two years ago. There are many politicians who are anxious to get into office, and the disturbances are aimed at overthrowing the present ministry. They claim also that even if they have to be under some power, they had rather be under any other than Britain. In this, however, they show their ignorance of conditions • obtaining in countries such as Germany, Italy or Japan. The people of Burma enjoy more freedom than any other people in the world, but they don’t appreciate it. Instead the local press often publishes a lot of falsehoods or deliberate lies, just to excite the populace, mainly the ignorant ones. Britain has given them a free hand to try to manage the affairs of their country, but they are making a mess of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The employees of nearly all the leading corporations were forced to go on strike, some even being kept in custody in the pagoda grounds. Foreign influence has a good deal to do with these disturbances, undoubtedly. What yet may happen we can’t say. Day By day it appears clearly that the Devil is gathering the nations to Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">road just constructed connects </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Burma </span><span class="font8">with China. Goods and ammunition are being sent now to China via this route. It is remark- . able that since the opening of this road all the aforesaid disturbances in Burma began. An attempt was made at causing a general strike, which so far has failed, and particularly the railway service has been regular. It is now ' proposed to link India with Burma by rail. ' That would be useful in time of war but also will help trade during peace. The cost of construction is estimated at </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">crore of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">rupees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THERE </span><span class="font8">recently appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> an article dealing with the little-known island of Bali. Probably less known are the Tongan islands, sometimes called the Friendly islands, the queen of which recently celebrated her fiftieth jubilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Treacherous reefs surrounding the islands, and particularly the main one of the group, help to keep visitors away, This is possibly advantageous to the Tongans, for “civilized” visitors frequently spoil the world’s natural beauty spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tonga is the last of the Pacific kingdoms, and a happy and beautiful kingdom it is. Poverty and want are unknown. The air is wonderfully pure, the rain gentle and sweet, and, as in Bali, life is natural and free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One hundred and fifty-nine islands, scattered over an, area of two hundred and sixty-nine square miles, comprise the group. The inhabitants, pure Polynesians, numbered slightly over 31,000 a year ago. A further resemblance to Bali is seen in the physique of the Tongans. They have fine, brown bodieai; the young men are stalwart, and the girls really beautiful. The climate of the islands is not as good as that of Bali; for Tonga suffers from severe humidity and hurricanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not many of the so-called amenities of civilization are to be had on the islands. There is no electric light, and there are no newspapers. In these days of a prostituted press, the absence of the latter is perhaps a blessing. What appeals to the visitor most of all is the natural warm-heartedness of the Tongans themselves. Soon after one’s arrival gifts in token of welcome and friendship are presented, and the dignity and courtesy of the people is immediately apparent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ To Jehovah, the great Theoerat, we give all praise for the privilege granted us to serve Him at this hour of great distress amongst the peoples of earth. In Jehovah’s service, we are now ten months on tour in the Northern Provinces, where we have been able, by Jeho-■ vah’s grace, to carry the message of God’s Kingdom in printed form to the hungry and thirsty souls in the following places, to wit: Idah, Lokoja, Loco, Makurdi, Kafanchan, Bukuru, Jos, Bauchi, Potiskum, Maiduguri, Zaria, Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Minna, and Zungeru, the former capital of the Provinces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By Jehovah’s grace we succeeded in placing 100 bound books and 2,724 booklets for the period of four months, January to April, 1939, in which w<sup>r</sup>e rejoice greatly because this is a good report compared with our reports submitted to the Branch office, Lagos, in the previous campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Lokoja we were arrested and charged with the offense of hawking in the Township without permit, and the next day we were tried by the Commissioner of Police, who propounded many questions to us; and having received satisfactory answers backed up with scriptures, he concluded with, “May God<sup>:</sup> bless your work.” At Sokoto we were again arrested and the same charge was repeated. On this occasion the trial was conducted by the District Officer, who, after we had given answers to his questions, received the booklets Kace </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the Facts, Protection,</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font8"> in the Hausa language. There were arrests of similar kinds which arc not worth mentioning, and we had pleasure in them all because the arrests afforded us full chanee to deliver good testimony to the authorities of the Provinces, and thus we rejoice as partakers of the afflictions of the Gospel .according to the power of- God. (2 Timothy 1: S) • ■' ■ Our zeal was tripled when unexpectedly we saw the Watch Tower representative, who drove his sound-car from Lagob to -Zaria, a distance’ of. over 617 miles, where he met us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Leaving us for Lagos, he left many eartons of books and booklets for us, encouraging us , to keep on moving. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The picture shows one of the methods we used in Minna township in advertising the King and His kingdom and which method curiously arrested the attention of the public to get the booklets </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font8"> In this very method our speaking trumpet has been a great help to us in this part, because when it is sounded, all heads can be seen through the windows peeping, -we approach them, and in this way we can place more books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In one village where we called it was observed at the first sounding of our speaking trumpet that all the villagers were jumping into the bush and some were seen locking . their doors, and wdien we asked them the reason for their running, they said they heard ■. that war was coming. We then gathered the p«:ple and explained to them about God’s kingdom, the only hope of the world, and also about the war,'how it would be fought and those that would be saved. In the circumstances, they gladly obtained booklets in their . (Hausa) language.—Thomas Ozurumbah and Benson N. Ogbonnah, pioneers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ I made a back-call on a party who had taken a booklet from me and who showed interest ; I found the party had read the booklet through three times and gladly took more. At another home, which I visited with the phonograph, the lady of the house would not listen, because, she said, she had heard the phonograph a few weeks before. I smiled and told her we had a new record. She listened to ... “Miracles” and “Instruction” and was so impressed that she subscribed for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I called at another home with the phonograph, and the man of the house told me that if I was calling as a Christian I could play the phonograph, but that he /wanted nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses. lie seemed sincere, that he really thought Jehovah’s witnesses were a bad group of people, so I went ahead and played the records “Miracles”-and “Instruction”. About half way through the first, record he discovered I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but remarked to his wife that he saw nothing wrong with the recorded message. After listening to the other side he told</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">me he saw where he had been wrong about his belief regarding Jehovah’s people, that what hfe had heard was not true, and that he would pot be against us any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Witnessing on another street, I found a man who had a goat-like disposition. He said he was .going to call the police, and he did follow me down the street, going into the homes I had just left. It became so noticeable that I asked at one home who this man ■was. When the goat arrived at this home, and found I had closely inquired concerning him, he became very fearful and withdrew from sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I called at a home with the phonograph'and the wife called her husband out of the garden to listen. At first he did not seem much interested, but listened, said he enjoyed the record and would subscribe for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font8">I visited him later with a set of records, and he is now greatly interested in the truth and came to the study Sunday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I called on Mayor O’Neal and Chief of Police Matthews. Both were still somewhat embittered, but the most of the people receive us kindly in their homes and appreciate the message which we bring to them by means of the phonograph—0die De Berry, Georgia.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>God’s Glories in the Smoky Mountains</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ How beautiful the earth is even in its unfinished condition and marred as it is by unsightly billboards, each advertising its own particular brand of death in the form of tobacco! Babylonish steeples rising in the sky are usually the first things one sees when entering picturesque little towns, as well as commercial signs pointing out the special wonders and beauties to be seen, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">at a price!</span><span class="font8"> All of these things remind a Jehovah’s witness how completely Satan has commercialized his world; and even the wonders of nature bring in a steady stream of gold to his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much has been said and written about the great beauties and wonders of creation, which fill the Lord’s people with awe and reverence and a greater love for their great Creator. Come with me now to western North Carolina, where the great Smoky mountains raise their mighty heads, rugged and lofty, tier upon tier, all clothed in verdant green. This is one of the most beautiful sights it is possible to imagine, and beggars description. No poetry or painting could express its loveliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As we drive into this section from Georgia .the mountains lie ahead of us in a hazy blue,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 4, 1039 </span><span class="font8">outlined against the sky; and as we drive on the blue changes to emerald green, and we are in the Smokies! Here we begin to climb, and the road circles round and round, up, up, up; , wonderful engineering, showing what even imperfect man can do when his thoughts are not on war. We are at the top of one of the crests and look down—a sheer drop of thousands of feet below—to cabins nestled in fertile valleys, with rivers and creeks winding in and out. Faintly we catch the tinkle of a cowbell, and the rushing of waters as they dash over natural dams&gt;)f stone and rock. By the way, many of the farmers make their own electricity by means of water-wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Looking at these great hills, one would never dream that farming could be carried on so efficiently; but there are very fertile farms even at the tops of these mountains. Sometimes the fields being cultivated are so steep and slanting that, looking from one hill to another, it seems as if the farmer and his animal must come tumbling down, and makes one feel that “thar ain’t no law of gravity”, I said “animal” advisedly, for these farmers use horses, mules, oxen with the old-fashioned yokes, Ferdinand the bull, and even the family milch cow!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of these farms are miles off the roads, and one must walk up the steep mountainsides, cross rushing creeks over logs throwh from hank to bank, and, panting and winded, stumble to the cabin door to be greeted by the whole family; for, as you may imagine, it is . a great event to have a stranger drop “up” to see them. Everything has to be “toted” to these places either by muleback or man power. The mountains are too steep for even a wagon. We visited one farm on a river bank which had no road on the side the farm was on, and the only means of getting across was by a swinging footbridge or by boat. The farmer had to wait until the river was low enough to ford, in the fall, before he could take any crops out or bring heavy supplies in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These valleys and farm communities are called “coves”, and take their names usually from the rivers and creeks on which they are situated. There are hundreds of these creeks ■ and eoves, and many of them are thickly inhabited. The mountainsides are covered with wonderful apple orchards; for this is a famous apple country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have seen several thunderstorms lately, anti it is a wonderful sight to witness the lofty</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">13 *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">heights outlined against the inky blackness of the clouds, with the lightning splitting the blackness, and the deep rumble of thunders. We try to picture what these mountains will be like when the might and power of Jehovah is manifested at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As we drive on evening falls, and dusky night begins to cover the landscape. We now see these great mountains silhouetted against the sky and are reminded of Jehovah's watchcare over His own, as expressed in Psalm 125:1,2. Twinkling lights appear in little cabins scattered over the, hills, arid from the hedgerows comes the most delieate scent of honeysuckle, which literally covers the roadside, and blossoms all summer long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now darkness completely covers the earth, and, as if at a signal, thousands of fireflies appear and flit around us, turning on and off their phosphorescent light. I cannot begin to describe this last loveliness of the day, and can only say with the psalmist, “0 Jehovah, trow manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.”—Mrs. G. E, Fiske, Pioneer. &lt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ On January 1, I began the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Watchtower </span><span class="font8">Campaign”, anxious to have a part in it, but with very little hope of finding anyone interested enough to take a subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">called on a lady who had been witnessed to many times before by myself and other publishers. She always allowed us to play the record, but had never seemed to take any interest, and, in fact, would interrupt the record to talk about other things. I was very happily surprised, therefore, when she told me she had been waiting for a Jehovah’s witness to call. Heb husband had subscribed for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font8">about six months ago and she found it very interesting. She had put $2.00 away for “Christmas” presents, but after reading the advertisement on the back of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font8">magazine offering </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> she decided she would like to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">She remarked to me that we did not believfe in “Christmas”. I explained to her and showed her, in Jeremiah 10, what the heathen do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I had made arrangements for a back-call and called the following week. She asked numerous questions, one being “What is a Jona-dab'”’ She told us that when we had called before she had thought, “What right have they to come and try to change people to their religion </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1&quot;</span><span class="font8"> Then she began thinking, “Only </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">eight </span><span class="font8">went through at the time of Noah, and when Jesus Christ was on the earth. there were only a very few; so why wouldn't it be the same now ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">She went down in the basement and brought up the books and booklets she had obtained from witnesses before, mostly, she said, to get rid of the caller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have made arrangements for her to receive the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font8"> and believe that very shortly she will become a “laborer” with us. —N. Shafer, Canada.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Belated Convention News</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font8">IX witnesses, three of them ladies, drove from Oklahoma to the New York Convention. Arrived in Brooklyn, the ladies had not had time to get out of the car when three men came up in pompous manner and their spokesman wearing a Knights of Columbus button ordered them to remove from their ear the banner advertising Judge Rutherford’s public address. The Oklahoma men were not impressed. The Knights of Columbus spokesman swung at one of the Oklahoma citizens, when the smallest man among them all knocked two of the Brooklynites flat upon the pavement. Then another Oklahoma man, with his knee in the back of one of the Brooklyn parties, and his strong right arm pulling back on his collar, wiped his face on the sidewalk. He rose, tried it a second time, ( was treated to a second wiping on the sidewalk, and gave it up. A good time was had by all. Westerners are very informal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At one unknown Convention point a hostile person picked up a brick, intending to heave it through the side of one of Jehovah’s witnesses’ sound-cars. A husky colored witness struck him so hard under the chin that he dropped the brick and took an involuntary rest on the flat of his back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One individual, with less sense than reekless-ness, attacked a marcher, and broke the stick which bore* a loft the sign “Religion is a snare and a racket” — “Serve God and Christ the King”. The witness peacefully restrained him ' from doing further damage by causing him to recline upon the sidewalk, somewhat suddenly, and went on holding in his raised hand the sign, “Serve God and Christ the, King.” This happened near Madison Square Garden, New York, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font8">In ^Brooklyn one husky witness received a glancing blow from some passing Fascistic fist. He returned it on the jaw ; and while the troublemaker was gathering himself up from the pavement, two passers-by jumped into the line of march, and cried, “We are with you.” They begged the privilege of carrying a sign, and received it. They gladly continued to the end of the march, leaving the witness two hands for distributing circulars, having no further need, ■ of them for defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Denver a crowd of gangsters, sympathetic with one “Reverend Father&quot; McMenamin (guess his “church”), grabbed some of the information inarch placards. An athletic witness recovered the placards and, when struck on the head for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 6, 1939 </span><span class="font8">doing it, laid out the assailant on the sidewalk. A crowd gathered, and it looked as if a fight was inevitable, when proffered assistance was unexpectedly received from one of the onlookers. A well-known prize-fighter called out to the witness, asking, “Do you need any help, Dick?” The fight was all off. The Lord has His own way of taking care of His people. It may be added that six well-known boxers, one from Texas, famous throughout the West, and one from the Pacific Coast fleet, famous in the seven seas, were at that convention and well prepared to defend American liberties in Western style. Sometimes those who look for trouble are surprised when they really find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the Oklahoma convention the assistant chairman, Julius Johnson, was 7 feet 1 inch tall, while A. H. Macmillan, of Brooklyn, who came to preside at the meeting, is only 6 feet 1 inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Portland, Oregon, numerous signs advertising the convention were destroyed, and immediately after the convention a witness who, by permission, was visiting the boats in Portland Harbor was violently assaulted by a Catholic seaman.

<p><span class="font8">A witness from Montreal narrated how, at a meeting in the French section, officers of the law, obeying Cardinal Villeneuve, entered and seized all books, phonographs and records. The chairman said he did not mind so much the loss of all these, but sorrowed over the loss of his grip, containing all the hard-bought back-call slips. Suddenly a small piping voice of a child of seven spoke up, saying, “No, they’re not gone. I dropped your case out of the back window, because I knew what was inside.” Babes and sucklings 1 0 thou great and good God of thy people I</span></p>

She will be allowed twelve weeks’ absence during confinement, and no signing away of her rights will be recognized by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has always seemed rather unfair that when a woman takes on the responsibility of supporting a husband she should be dismissed from her work. It ain’t right, nowheres.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Unpardonable</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font8">UCH has been written about the so-called “unpardonable sin”. The Scriptural </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">mining </span><span class="font8">of the term follows. “The wages of sin is death.” (Romans 6:23) All mankind today, being sinners by inheritance, are therefore dying, and other billions have already died. Those thereof that have not committed or do not commit the “unpardonable sin” are in line for an awakening from the dead unto a resurrection, because Jehovah God has provided for the salvation of humankind by the Redeemer, Christ Jesus. (John 5:28,29) Those that have committed the “unpardonable sin” will never have a resurrection. They have committed the “sin unto death”, that is, the “second death”, meaning destruction from which there is no return.—See 1 John 5:16,17; Revelation 20 :</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">14 ; </span><span class="font8">21: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Specific eases of the unpardonable sin are Adam, Judas Iscariot, and the scribes and Pharisees that conspired to have Jesus murdered. Jehovah God gave Adam a choice, of obedience and life or of lawlessness and death, with no promise of redemption and resurrection. Adam chose the latter course, and died, and must remain in that condition. Christ Jesus died, not for Adam, who was sentenced to destruction because of rebellion, but for Adam’s offspring, that those thereof exercising faith and obedience might gain life. Judas, chosen as an apostle and a witness of Jesus’ miracles and personally with Jesus for about three years, betrayed Him for filthy lucre. The unpardonableness of Judas’ crime is proved by Jesus’ words calling Judas “lost” and “the son of perdition”. (John 17:12) To His apostles Jesus said concerning Judas: “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one* of you is a devil?” (John 6:70) Judas therefore experiences the Devil’s fate, eternal destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The holy spirit is the invisible power of Jehovah God, whose name is Holy, and it oper</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ated </span><span class="font8">and manifested itself through the words and deeds and miracles of Christ Jesus. The wicked Pharisees accused Him of serving the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 6J 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Devil. To them Jesus said: “But if.I cast but devils by the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. . . . And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the holy [spirit], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">world to come. ... 0 generation of vipers! how can ye, being evil, speak good things?” (Matthew 12: 22-34) Designating them as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">offspring or seed of the Serpent, the Devil, Jesus said: “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell [ (Greek) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna;</span><span class="font8"> destruction] ?”— Matthew 23; 33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now bringing the question down to our day: One who willfully rejects the Lord and His kingdom and persecutes those who advertise God’s kingdom is certainly sinning against the light, because it is the spirit of God that causes the light to shine out that men may see the way to salvation. Such conduct, therefore, is sinning against the spirit of God, Jesus said: 'He who speaks against the holy spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font8">in the world to come.’ Also the inspired apostle adds: “For if we sin wilfully after that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font8">have • received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.” (Hebrews 10:26) This latter scripture announces a rule that applies to all, in harmony with the words Jesus addresses to the “goats” in the parable of the sheep and goats: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [destruction], prepared for the devil and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font8">angels.” “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [(Greek) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">kolasin;</span><span class="font8"> cutting-off].” (Matthew 25:41,46) These words apply at the end of Satan’s world, where we now are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Without a question of doubt there are many among the clergy of “Christendom” that profess to be the servants of God and Christ and have the Bible and claim to teach it, and that see, from the evidence that the Lord </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font8">brought to their attention, that the Kingdom is now here, operating in the midst </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of God’s </span><span class="font8">enemies. And yet; those churchmen, moved by Pharisaical selfishness, spurn the Kingdom and the Kingdom message that Jehovah’s witnesses bear, and persecute those who bring the message to the people. They also use all their power and influence to prevent the people from hearing the truth of and concerning the Kingdom, Certainly they are not ignorant. Their opposing the kingdom of God is not be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font8">cause of ignorance, but they are doing so willfully. They are far better informed than the Pharisees of old, and of necessity the Lord’s announced rule as against the Pharisees applies with equal strength to those modern-day clergymen. Concerning suchlike the Lord Jesus said: “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ’ for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (Matthew 23:13,15,33) Is there any further benefit to be received- by such willful, deliberate opposers of the Kingdom from the ransom sacrifice of Jesus? The Scriptural answer is No. God caused His words concerning such willful sinners to be written at Hebrews 10: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only have such willful sinners indulged in religious teachings and practices contrary to God’s A^ord, by which they have led numerous persons into Satan’s snare, but they have also willfully caused millions of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">others </span><span class="font8">to be ensnared by the Devil by preventing them from hearing the truth. There is a great crowd of persons who willfully support the religious leaders and join with those leaders in the present-day opposition to the Kingdom of God under Christ, which Kingdom the spirit of God is now causing to be proclaimed by His witnesses on earth. If those supporters of the religious opposers should die in that condition* is there hope for them in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">redi</span><span class="font8">rection period? If they were to be awakened during the thousand-year reign of Christ, is there any reason why they would avail themselves of His ransom sacrifice and obey the divine law* then ? It does not appear that they would. God’s Word does not hold out any hope of salvation to those religious leaders who willingly oppose His kingdom and His King </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">thus commit the unpardonable sin, nor does it hold out hope for the adherents of those </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font8">ligious systems who likewise willfully oppose the Kingdom. Read Luke 17: 26-30.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Reflections of a Cotton Grower</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ I hate cotton because of what it does to the children; it keeps them out of school so they may. pick cotton, and they grow up in ignorance. We should change the school year, in the cotton-growing-sections. School should run from January 1 to July 31, and the vacation season from August 1 to December 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much cotton is produced by share-croppers because it does not, and cannot, pay a living wage. Share-croppers generally till from twenty to thirty acres, quarter of which usually is planted to corn and three-quarters to cotton; the average production is slightly under 200 pounds an acre, so the average cropper raises between six and nine bales— or between three and four and a half bales for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' When, as now, cotton brings under $45 a bale, his share is worth between $150 (with seed) and $225. That is for a whole family, which means six or seven people or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nations that do not raise cotton seem to be better off than the cotton-produeing ones.— Granville T. Chapman.</span></p>

The wheat crop this year is estimated at 967,412,000 bushels, the largest since 1915, and with the exception of that year the largest on record. And there are bumper crops all along the line. Com, oats, barley, rye, rice, hay, beans, potatoes, tobacco, sugar beets, hops, peaches, pears, grapes—all of them will exceed the average crop of the ten years from 1927 to 1936. Prices will be low enough, because of this plenty, so that more people can buy more of everything to eat. What disaster!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ There are now three methods of sterilizing soils, i.e., freeing them from weeds: one is by live steam, another by direct application of flame, and the third is by putting the soil to be sterilized into a large box and drilling several holes in the earth. Into these holes are put a few drops of tear gas. The whole is covered with a canvass, and in two days the soil is entirely free from weed contamination and can be used for any purpose such as greenhouses, lawns, golf courses, etc.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Some Pagan Ceremonies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ Lent.—Today, as for centuries past, Lent is a “'Feast” of the Roman Catholic Church. Forty days prior to “'Easter” Romanists abstain from meat. Originally Lent was observed by the Babylonians, long before the birth of Christ, in honor of the Babylonian goddess whose name was Astarte, one of the titles of Beltis, the “queen of heaven”. Lent is observed today, forty days of it, in the spring of the year by the Yezidis, or Pagan-Devil-worship-ers of Koordistan, who have inherited it from their early masters, the Babylonians. The Pagan Mexicans, before the Church of Rome “converted” them to Popery, also held their forty days Lent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Holy Week.—This is the week prior to “Easter” and observed by Papists as something very special. There is no Scriptural authority for its observance. Every week is holy to true Christians. This Holy Week humbug business was swept away at the Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Palm Sunday.—The Papists on this day take sprigs of trees and hedges to their churches and the priest “blesses” them. Their possession/'keeps away the Devil and remits sin”. This is another superstitious abomination that has crept into the Church of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Good Friday.—This is also of Pagan origin, as it was on the Friday before “Easter”, the day of the pagan goddess, Astarte (from which the word Easter is taken), that &quot;buns” were made and used in the worship of the Chaldean goddess. Do Protestants ever ask themselves as to the origin of the Hot-Cross Bun? The Bun, or “Boun”, was the “sacred bread” offered to the gods under the rites of Chaldean worship 1500 years before the Christian era. This “Boun” is referred to as a thing of idolatrous worship in Jeremiah 7 •. 18. In the olden times the Bun was “offered” in pagan worship on the festival of Easter, or Astarte, but good Presbyterians and others today eat the Bun, and this on the date of a pagan festival!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Easter.—-Its Chaldean name condemns it! The name is found today on Assyrian monu-</span><span class="font8">meats as “Ishtar”. This means Astarte or Easter, which, as we have already pointed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">out, </span><span class="font8">was one of the titles of Beltis, the “queen of heaven”. (Even the “Beltane Queens” crowned these days take their title from “Ishtar” or “Astarte”.) The word “Easter” is foreign to Scripture. True, it is found in Acts 12, verse </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">4, </span><span class="font8">but it has no right to be there. The word in the original Greek is not a word that means the day on which Christ was raised from the dead. The word “Easter” is a mistranslation of the original. The Greek ■word is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pas oka, </span><span class="font8">meaning Passover. The word is used by Paul, in 1 Corinthians 5:7, where he says, “Christ our passover [pascAa] is sacrificed for us.” Let the reader read Acts 12 from verse 1, and can he conceive Herod, an enemy of the Christian faith, honoring the observance of Easter, if Easter were then a Christian institution? Why should Herod, who was not a Christian, hold Peter till after the due celebration of , w<sup>r</sup>hat is claimed to be a Christian festival? The very suggestion is an insult to every intelligent person. And what about the Easter eggs? Where do they eome in? What connection can an egg have with the resurrection of Jesus Christ? Again we find paganism to the forefront. An egg was one of the symbols of Astarte, dr Easter, the Babylonian “queen of heaven”. Here is the story of the Easter egg. 'An egg of wondrous size fell from heaven into the Euphrates river. Fishes rolled it to the bank; doves settled on it and hatched it, and out came the Syrian goddess Astarte, or Easter? Hence the Easter egg of today, as pagan as Easter Day itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christmas.—Here we have ‘ more pagan-, ism! No person knows the date of Christ’s birth, and it is sheer presumption and irreverence for any person to tell us that Jesus Christ was born on the 25th of December. The Scriptures are silent on the date of Christ’s birth, and they are silent for a purpose, that purpose being that we should not as Christians observe Christ’s birth. Every intelligent student of history believes that Christ was not born in the depths .of winter. It was not till 400 years after Christ’s ascension to heaven that His birth was observed, and with the other “festivals” which we are considering, “Christmas” is purely of pagan origin. “Christmas” means “Christ’s Mass”, a Roman Catholic observance of Roman Catholic origin. But the name “Christmas” also means “Yuleday”, and here we find its pagan origin. “Yule” is the .Chaldee for “infant”, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“little child”, and the 24th of December was observed as “Yule-day” or “Child’s Day” by our pagan Anglo-Saxon ancestors long before the Christian era. Our ancestors also celebrated what we term Christmas Eve as “Mother Night”, and this long before the time of Christ. Further, in Egypt, the “son of the queen of heaven” was said to have been born on the 25th of December. Christmas in its entirety is wholly pagan, and the sooner Protestants of all denominations come to appreciate the danger of celebrating these things of paganism, the better it will be for Protestantism.—Alexander Ratcliffe, Scotland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The idolatry in New Orleans was fittingly introduced by McNamara’s orders to shoot to kill Jehovah’s witnesses if they dared receive </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">Bible lecture broadcast all over the . world. Next step was to decorate the city lamp posts with 5-foot candles and set up the largest amplifying system ever- known so that the whole city could listen to the Italian broadcasting gibberish from Vatican City. Then the general manager of the Hearst newspapers made a fervent plea against all forms of intolerance. Fine I Then Farley said, “In God we trust,” but he really meant “God” and McNamara, mostly McNamara. Meantime Cardinal Mundelein sat on his throne. Don’t overlook that. Suppose he had sat on a milk stool. Think how it would have balled everything up. It is important to know what he sat on. Now, for instance—-but why go into that? Fifty thousand got soaked to the skin. Five hundred fainted. Somebody got a broken leg. Priests went to bat, 100 at a elip, each with </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">missal, chalice veil, burse, pall, wine and water cruets. Every priest must have his wine every morning. Archbishop Glennon spoke in favor of rugged individualism, by which he meant, of coilTse, such acts as those of his co-religionist McNamara in offering to kill Jehovah’s witnesses for exercising their rights. Bishop Morris said “the Catholic Church has become an asset to the Nation for morality” of the McNamara kind. Farley struck at state interference with religion, but he thought McNamara did the right thing, because Jehovah’s witnesses are not religionists, but merely Christians, which is the exact opposite. Cicogna ni said, “God is here.” You bet. For details see 2 Corinthians 4:4. Of the original audience of 65,000, about 15,000 adults skipped for shelter when it started to rain. Of the 50,000 that remained, 35,000 were school children that had to stay and take it; so the adults were split fifty-fifty on going and staying. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">few adults fainted, and more than 500 little folks, worn out by the intolerable and insufferable ceremonies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In an address at the Catholic blowout in New Orleans Joseph V. Connolly, general manager of Hearst newspapers, asked for a world-wide movement in “defense of ail those .who suffer persecution”. He did this just a few days after a fellow Catholic in the same city had threatened to blow out the brains of Christians who desired to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">hear a Bible dis</span><span class="font8">course broadcast from London. Connolly conveniently shuts his eyes to the fact that the -. greatest persecutors of Christians for a thousand years or more have come from the very institution he is so eager to perpetuate, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, Another speaker at the same function, Bishop John B. Morris, of Little Rock, Arkansas, said, “We [Catholics, but not Jehovah’s witnesses] are permitted in this country to serve God according to the dictates of our consciences.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In the city of York ton, Saskatchewan, a Ukrainian man lay ill in the hospital and was reading some of Judge Rutherford's books. Another man near him, also Ukrainian, was dying of eancer. In sympathy the first pa- .-r tient asked the nurse to take the cancer pa- mST tient some of the booklets to read, to pass the time and comfort him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the cancer patient was reading a priest came to call on these men, and on observing what the cancer patient was reading he became very indignant, and denounced these booklets and reproved the one who was reading them. The poor man answered that he could find nothing wrong in them, but thought they were for the purpose of teaching him something. After this the priest did not call further to see this man, and he became worried, thinking he had committed a great sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Later another priest came to the hospital and came to visit these men. They inquired if they had done wrong to read these booklets, and asked why the other priest had failed to visit them. This priest replied that so long _ as the books contained food for the soul it </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">jg </span><span class="font8">was all right to read them. It seems that even some of the priests are confused.—Mrs. J, Walters, Canada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">RMjJ Baseball fans know that the New York Yankees are strong favorites</span></p>

But it wasn’t until </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a re</span><span class="font8"><sub>cen</sub>t- disclosure by Jimmy Powers, a prominent New York sports writer, that they found out the world champions now have the additional “distinct advantage” of the prayers of the nuns and priests of the missions scattered throughout the whole world. With the newly discovered patron saint of baseball, St. Antony, getting them out of their infrequent batting slumps, and with red, white, and blue candles being burned in front of Our Lady’s altar each morning for them, what chance have the Red Sox or any other team ' to overhaul them! With the nuns becoming baseball-minded, seeing that now the Yank box scores are posted in monasteries and eon-vents from coast to coast, the next step is to inaugurate “nun day” and thus give all the fair ladies seats, in the grandstand. Further, Jimmy Powers points out that the next time you see a team’s star hitter over in some corner murmuring to himself you can assume, if his batting percentages have fallen, he is saying something like, this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“St. Antony, St. Antony, Come around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Something’s been lost, And cannot be found.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I Ate Mept on Friday</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ I was raised a Catholic and was taught in the convent that if I ate meat on Friday I would die, I believed that implicitly. One day I became very angry at my mother and decided that I wanted to die, and then she would be sorry. I ate a lot of meat on Friday; nothing happened, and I knew from that day, though I still continued to attend church, that the whole thing is a racket, Since then I came in contact with the truth, and am rejoicing in it.—Pennsylvania, Zone 6.</span></p>

When I was a little girl an old Catholic man said in the presence of my father that he would rejoice on the day when he saw the streets of Mobile flooded with Protestant blood. If that spirit existed then, certainly it is worse now; for that fras more than fifty years ago.—Mrs. J. L. McDaniel, Mississippi.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Lying About the Almighty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font8">The Catholic Lay Apostle Guild, Room 906, 154 Nassau street, New York, circulated a leaflet marked with the Imprimatur of Patrick Cardinal Hayes in which occur the following false statements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suppose you visit the President—and he refers you and the object of your visit to his secretary, you may not like this, hut you have no recourse. So it is with confession of sins to a priest. We may prefer to go direct to God Himself; however, He has referred us to His representatives on earth, and whether we like it or not, we must go to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Maybe you already know that prayers may be offered to Jehovah God, the great Creator, direct, but you might like to have a few scriptures, His own word, on the subject, so here are just a few:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Pray to thy Father which is in secret.”—Matthew 6: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let your requests he made known unto God.” —Philippians </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font7">; 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”—John 16:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you,”—James 4: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The approach to God is in His appointed way, through 'the only name given under heaven or among men’. (Acts 4:12) Prayers offered through priests, Marys, “saints” and other persons are not heard at all and are worse than wasted breath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ On </span><span class="font8">the very day when the pope announced he had made J. Pierpont Morgan and Thomas W. Lamont Knights of St. Gregory the Great, the brokerage firm of Richard Whitney &amp;&nbsp;Company (Whitney’s brother is a member of the Morgan firm) was suspended from the New York Stock Exchange and promptly went into bankruptcy.

The occasion of the hilarity of the thirteen gentlemen was “Aux fetes Jubilaires de Saint-Jeah-Baptiste”. So far, so good. But the editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">La Presse</span><span class="font8"> is a clever wag; for, without saying why he did it, next to this four-column cut was a four-column story entitled “Lett re Pastorale Collective. De Son Eminence le Cardinal Archeveque de Quebec et de Leurs Excellences les Archeveques et Eveques de la province civile de Quebec: Sur la Temperance”. The pastoral letter is a stirring appeal to the people of Quebec against intemperance. In the statistics it shows that in the fifteen years from 1922 to 1937 the bill of the province of Quebec for liquor was $700,000,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ You appear to be surprised when I say the sympathies of the French-Canadian would be with Italy in the event of a war between that country and England.

<p><span class="font8">The French-Canadians don’t want to go to war ... If war happens—and the possibility it may seems more probable every day—and Italy is on one side and England on the other, the sympathy of the French-Canadians in Quebec will be on the side of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We French-Canadians are not Latins, but Normans, but we have become Latinized over a long period of years. The French-Canadians are Fascists by blood but not by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, the French-Canadians have always been under dictators. When they came over to this country they were under the power of Louis XIII. Then came Cardinal Richelieu— </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">dictator and a cardinal at the same time, which made him an absolute dictator with full authority over the Communists of that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">All Things Considered</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Supreme Court has now decided that the lower courts were correct when they said that school boards had the right to expel pupils who refused to salute the national flag when state laws required such a salute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So here, 1 think, we have a situation worthy of Gilbert and Sullivan’s attention’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The law says that ■ I, as a small boy, must go to school. If I refuse to go to school the law sends officers after me, and after trial for truancy I can be forcibly committed to a school for truants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no legal or social doubt about this. Education is compulsory throughout our land, and boys and girls must go to school whether they like it or not. If they try to stay away from school, and their parents connive with them in their truancy, the parents can be punished for contributing to the delinquency of their offspring.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390096_files/g_E_19390096-8.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:244pt;">
<p><span class="font7">Courage, men ( ?); we’ll save America yet</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The theory behind this is that an uneducated person is a liability to the state. We cannot afford to have people grow up without having been to school. This theory has been so widely accepted that the rare objector to it is considered quite definitely crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Now, however, there arises a situation that the founders of compulsory education certainly never considered. Children appear who, because of an unpremeditated tangle of laws, are not only not required to attend school but are forbidden to do so. In my boyhood, anyone who wanted to go fishing instead of spending the day on a hardwood bench, doing readin’, writin’ ’n’ ’ritbmetie, had to have a note from his mother. Today, all he has to do is join Jehovah’s witnesses or some other sect which considers saluting a flag as akin to idol worship, and he won’t be allowed in a school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The thing is so mixed up that not even a decision of the Supreme Court can quite clarify it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is all very well to say that laws must be obeyed, and if the law, as it does in New York and elsewhere, says that school children must salute the flag, then salute it they must. But what about the preservation of religious liberty? It may he argued that to require a member of Jehovah’s witnesses to salute the flag is just as much an abrogation of religious freedom as to require a Roman Catholic to eat meat on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would he simpler if these objectors to flag saluting had any objections to the social and political system that the flag symbolizes. Unfortunately, they have not. They are perfectly good Americans, just as patriotic as anybody, and, in a pinch, probably more dependable than most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Their hostility is limited to a ritual that, for reasons understood only by themselves, they consider at variance with their ereed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In their efforts to find a punishment to fit the crime, the courts have got themselves into a worse muddle than the one from w’hieh they tried to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should be said that this is one of the unsolved problems of democracy. It is easy to say that democracy guarantees liberty of conscience. Many of those who first peopled this continent came here in search of that very liberty. But has that liberty no limits? How far can conscience go before the state overrules it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the last war we did not have many conscientious objectors, but even the few we did have constituted a problem that we handled in a way not altogether pleasant to remember. As a matter of fact, we didn’t handle it at all in accordance with democratic theory. We handled it precisely as any totalitarian state would handle it. That ia to say, when it came to the question of military service, we didn’t merely limit the rights of conscience; we abolished them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">That, perhaps, is one of the reasons why one may be optimistic about the future.

<p><span class="font8">&quot;What a great difference in a few hundred miles. In New York tractors are seen everywhere. On arriving in Beaufort, S.C., it is quite common to see a steer or a bull trotting along pulling a wagon. Most of the plowing is done with oxen and bulls. This being a group of islands, many strange sights greet the eye. “Whoopa,” a colored boy yells, and if you investigate he is probably selling raw shrimp at 10c a quart. Strange fishing craft, both sail and motor, are to be seen. As those too high to go under the bridge come near, men turn a windlass; round and round they walk, and a drawbridge opens. Most people from elsewhere get quite fidgety as they wait in line. Why go to Europe?—L. C. Ross.</span></p>

The Secretary of the Interior finally gave permission for Miss Anderson to sing from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a fitting place. Mrs. Roosevelt resigned from the D. A.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">* British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Heniery (London)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>War Conditions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">• The feeling of ease from a great fear of war which followed the Munich settlement last September soon passed away^ Since then there has been a realization that peace in Europe and in Britain is impossible while Hitler and Mussolini are in control of Germany and Italy. The British premier got a heavy blow when he realized that Hitler had humbugged him—as many well understood was the case. After that came a swift change in Britain’s policy towards the dangers which threatened the existence of Britain as a free country, and the disruption of what is called the British Empire. If war came it was plain that Britain would get severely wounded before it could defend itself, and there was a great cry for defensive preparation. A state of war really , began to obtain. Money was freely spent. Then ' began a more active set of moves in the political game: pacts and agreements with European countries were sought and entered into. This meant preparation for offensive war, to go to the aid of those with whom pacts were made. More money; more preparation for war, and less of the idea of the self-defense of Britain. Hitler and his men then began the ery that Britain and France wore trying to encircle Germany, and the cry has evidently been effective in Germany, setting the peoples of Germany in anger against Britain, and agitating for a war spirit, nation against nation. As all the world knows, Britain has been trying to get a pact with the mighty Russia, and a majority of the people of Britain see in that combination the only ■way of keeping Hitler and his war leaders from throwing Europe into the misery of a destructive general war and such as would make the last horror mild in Comparison both in its sufferings and in its consequences. War preparation goes on apace. Britain is now spending at the rate of £2,000,000 a day in extra expenditure, or, including its ordinary costs, is spending </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font8">the rate of £4,000,000 a day, to compare with the £7,000,000 a day, the peak expenditure during the Great War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pact desired with Russia and which has<sup>;</sup> been under mutual consideration for three months did not mature. Russia wanted /to make certain of its own interests, and there are many persons in the high places of politics in Britain who are adverse to any such arrangement with Russia, and who did what they could to prevent a military agreement— it is hinted that some in the very highest places do not want a British-Russian pact. Also it is certain that aversion to such agree- • ment is so positive a feature of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as to make it as certain that the Hierarchy was a controlling factor in the delay. Perhaps its influence is strongest of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That there arc many Roman Catholics in Government offices in Whitehall is common knowledge, and some are in important places in the Foreign Office. These, it is said, do not disguise their opinion that Britain should not <sub>:l </sub>make an alliance with Russia. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cavalcdde</span><span class="font8"> re-cently said, &quot;Weight carried by Roman Catholic opinion in the Foreign Office was proved during the Spanish civil war: members of the Cabinet found themselves up a department brick wall of Catholic sympathy, and there is no doubt that during the present world trouble diplomats have at least partly interpreted policy from a religious standpoint.” Hence the ten-year non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin came as a great shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then there is a war of words, with the purpose of getting the democracies (Britain chiefly) into a “state of nerves”. Dr. Joseph Goebbels, loudspeaker for Hitler, gets himself reported in the British newspapers, though . his efforts do not create the “nervous state” intended. No doubt he is an annoyance, but’ his measure is taken, and his words are passed by with yesterday’s news. But no one knows where next Hitler will throw his weight, with the result that a constant watchfulness is maintained, which may be illustrated by the fact that the anti-aircraft guns to protect London are manned and in readiness eftery minute of the twenty-four hours of the day. It cannot be said that the people of Britain are in any way fearful, but they readily submit to conditions which in time past could and would be agreed to only under actual war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recruiting for the forces is considered satisfactory, and at present there are no indications of further conscription: the 200,000 young men of the age of 20 years are regis-tered. There is as yet no outcry among the “patriots” about conscientious objectors,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. though it is certain there would be were conscription more' generally made law.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark214"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>Big Business</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• In the meantime Big Business is getting as much as it can out of the situation. The Government hag announced its purpose to control profits in armaments and Government con- tracts; but apparently there are loopholes through which much profit can slip without coming under the Government’s control. These huge sums of money which are being spent by the various governments mean much trading, and some are going to get what they can out of the trade. Moral and patriotic considerations are not supposed to enter into business transactions: what is legal is right. A note was made recently about a very large quantity of Japanese salmon which British bier chants were contracting for. When the matter was raised in Parliament the responsible minister said the Government was not involved in the purchase—it would not do any such thing as buy Japanese salmon for food storage. But, it is said, the transaction has been completed. Moreover, another lot of £250,000 value is purchased and landed in Liverpool. The whole amount of over £2,000.000 will give the Japs so much British currency to enable them to carry on their “incident” with China, and to heap indignities on British subjects in the East, as well as to compete with the trade of Britain. It is said that the democracies of Britain and the Empire, the Dutch and America are supplying almost all the war necessities of Japan. Russia is the only nation that stands outside this trade; but Russian trade is under the control of its government, and Big Business has no chance there. It is said that the Japs label or print their tins so as to make them look like Canadian packing. This is artful of the Japs, but it suits the British importer very well; for what does he care if the purchasers are deceived, thinking they are buying Canadian packed fish.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>Roman Catholic Militiamen</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• The Roman Catholic </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font8"> “understands that all Catholic seminary students in Britain of military age have registered for service”. Of course,' and, naturally, it adds, “and that Bishop Matthew; nominated by the cardinal archbishop, is now negotiating on behalf of the Hierarchy with the war office to decide the de-<sup>1</sup> tails of the students’ service.” Cardinal Hins-<sup>!</sup> ley has-; emphatically dissociated Catholics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">from pacifists and conscientious objectors. Liberty such as is represented by these words is not allowed in the Roman Catholic system; but the Hierarchy will see that its students, obligated to it by vows, will be placed in such positions as will make for the increase of its interests, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>The Bomb Outrages</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">• The dastardly acts of the Irish Republicanarmy which have caused much destruction to property and some loss of life in England have at last compelled the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in England to declare its abhorrence of the wicked and wanton aets. Most of the perpetrators are members of the Catholic church, and faithful attendees at mass. For a time it appeared as if the Hierarchy intended to keep silent; but the association with the church was so openly known it had perforce to do something to save its face. After much destruction of property in England, openly avowed as the work of the Irish Republican army, the Government of Eire decreed the organization to be illegal in Ireland, and the Hierarchy in England told its priests to tell the worshipers that the church must not be considered as associated with the aims of these ruthless men. It might have done more to .stop the outrages than appears to have been done. Many of the makers and planters of bombs and incendiary “toys” have been, caught and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment ; but there is an army yet at large, thought by some to be in the pay of Germany, but which they deny.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>“Upon the Earth Distress of Nations”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">• That the time and the events of which Jesus spoke are now eome upon the earth is a thing well known to and understood by those who are “taught of the Lord”, is part of their common knowledge, and is shared by those who are associated with the faithful disciples of Jesus, the Jonadab brethren, the “other sheep” of whom Jesus spoke. By His favor they readily read the “signs of the times” which God has given for their guidance. The signs are such as can be read in some measure by all who have some knowledge of the words of Jesus: they are God’s warning to all who make profession of being Christians. But religionists are like the Jews of Jesus’ day: they' deride the message of the truth as the Jews derided Jesus, and they despise, the. messen- ' gers, the witnesses, as the Jews despised the disciples of Jesus. They are the modern scribes and Pharisees. Jesus agreed that those seribes and Pharisees had some wisdom; they could) he said, read the day’s weather signs, written in the heavens, plain to all who took notice. But there w<sup>r</sup>ere other signs, signs of the times, which ought to have been observed, could be read as readily, but to which they gave no heed. These were the signs which accompanied His presence, and which told plainly that the prophecies had begun to be fulfilled. Those leaders of the people made a great show of their religious fidelity to the sacred writings, but, said Jesus, they only proved that they were the sons of their fathers who killed the prophets of God. They were as blind as their fathers and as stupid as they in their refusal to heed the words of warning and instruction which their God sent to them. The seribes and Pharisees who rejected the signs of the ministry of Jesus were blinded to plain facts, made blind by reason of the fact that they had dug themselves into a position which brought them honor among men. The honor and the service of God were sought and served only in lipsendee and vain show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The saying, “History repeats itself,” is common, but there is a particular fulfillment in the repetition of the circumstances of the presence of Jesus at the first advent and those of His 'second coming’. The leaders and teachers of the “churches”, wrongly and falsely so called, have agreed to accept and to teach things concerning the purposes of God which are absolutely contrary to the words of Jesus. Jesus very clearly and definitely told that He would come a second time: so plainly is this stated that no professed Christian has an alternative but must accept the fact of a second coming. But the churches have determined for themselves a coming very different in character and purpose, and foreign to anything that Jesus said of it, and His words are made void by them. In the early days of churches the Devil, the great enemy, began sowing his tares, and setting false teachers in the communities, and part of his sowing was to get the belief set that the second coming of the Lord would not be till the church had taught all the world the doctrines of Christ and had got the whole world into some sort of willing subjection under the direction of his representatives, the leaders of the churches. As the false church of Rome grow in power and influence this false teaching got fixed, and has completely dominated all the churches. The so-called “Protestant” churches are Roman Catholic in this teaching as they are in the “orthodox” dogmas they hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By this idea, set, and persistently kept to the fore, the churches have made a place for themselves in the earth, and have claimed that they and their rule are the kingdom of heaven on earth. They have deceived the peoples who trust them and have given them support and obedience, and by this the leaders of the churches are counted amongst the world’s wise and great men. The Roman Catholic church, under the control of its Hierarchy, through its hold on the minds and bodies of men, is become the greatest force in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this was clearly before the eyes of the Lord Jesus when He spoke of His return. All His words relative thereto, and also those of the apostles who taught the church the mind of the Lord through the holy spirit, disclose that at His return there would be great profession of allegiance but such a lack of faith and reality that He would say to the many, “I never knew you” (Matthew 7:23); and He said, “When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth ?” (Luke 18:8) At the present time Rome holds itself aloof from all other religious organizations. It has its set policy to pursue. It expects to ride the storms which threaten the disruption of the world. Its doctrines and dogmas are set and no criticisms are allowed to ids members. Other sections of the religious “world” are in uncertainty, and much doubt. But none gives heed to the signs of the times; the most important to them is the witness which Jehovah God is giving through His witnesses to the fact that the Lord Jesus is now set on Jehovah’s holy hill of Zion, and that the time of which He spoke and the corresponding events in the earth are here present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great outward sign for all to read is marked by Jesus’ word, “upon the earth distress of nations,” and 'men’s hearts failing them for the things coming on the earth’. (Luke 21:25, 26) There are great multitudes of persons who pay no attention to what the clergy and the parsons say, but the 250 millions (and more) of the writings of Judge Rutherford, carried throughout the earth by Jehovah's witnesses, and the millions who have heard his voice by radio have had a witness given that they might read the signs of the time's, take warning thereby, and save themselves from those things which must inevitably fall upon the false professors and the heedless.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Uncle Sam has a new merchant marine fleet in the making, and that the new vessels </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font8">some possible use other than for merchandise is suggested by the fact that the Government contributed $10,000,000 to help </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">build </span><span class="font8">them.

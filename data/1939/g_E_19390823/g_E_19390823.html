<p><span class="font7">INTERVIEW FOR </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">QUESTION: May the public have from you a statement of the facts relating to the conspiracy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists to destroy you and the work of Jehovah’s witnesses during the World War !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, ANSWER: That would require a lengthy statement, but I will give you a brief review of the salient facts. At the outbreak of the World War, in 1914, I was in Europe, and remained there for about two months on a lecture tour throughout Scandinavia and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eng</span><span class="font7">land. The clergy of England were supporting the war, and from their pulpits the following phrase was often used by a preacher, addressed to the young men of the vicinity: “You must go to war; </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font7"> marry and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">breed </span><span class="font7">before you </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">go!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When I returned to America I found that most of the clergymen were urging the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">United </span><span class="font7">States to get into the war. Contrary to their course of action, William Jennings Bryan, who was at that time Secretary of State under President Wilson, was making a tour of the country urging the United States to stay out</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of the war. Mr. Bryan resigned as Secretary of State when the United States entered the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the years 1915 and 1916 and subsequently I gave many public addresses throughout the United States and Canada stressing the prophecy uttered by Jesus concerning the end of the world. (Matthew the 24th chapter) I pointed out that the events then coining to pass showed that the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule over the nations of earth came in 1914 and that the war and things accompanying it were strong evidence in fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by Jesus. I cited many scriptures to prove that the world war, as stated by Jesus, ■was &quot;the beginning of sorrows” upon the nations of earth and that those sorrows would continue until the final end at Armageddon. T stressed the command of the Lord Jesus, that the time had arrived when &quot;this gospel of the kingdom Whall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations”.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few clergymen in England, early in 1918, had issued a manifesto calling attention to the fact that the World War and accompanying events were in fulfillment of the prophecy of Jesus above quoted, concerning the end of the world. There were no Catholic clergymen and no other religionists in America obeying the commandment of the Lord by calling attention to this important prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the contrary, the clergymen of the United States and of Canada were preaching the same old stuff they had been telling the people for years, and adding thereto that now the nations must go to war, to “make the world safe for democracy”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T emphasized this fact: that if clergymen believed the Lord Jesus Christ and did represent Him they should obey His commandment; and obeying it they must be telling the people what the war meant and that this was evidence of the end of Satan’s organization and that soon Armageddon would follow ; and that they should tell the people that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world and urge them to prepare for the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I further emphasized the fact that if these men could not preach the truth as commanded by the Lord Jesus Christ, then they should cease claiming themselves to be representatives of God and Christ on earth, and take a position squarely on the other side, so that the people would not be deceived by their conduct and by their words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">My lectures along </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">this line greatly angered </span><span class="font7">the clergymen. In Canada and in tne United States the clergymen organized a campaign of abuse against me and against our Society. I challenged them to an open discussion of the matter, that the people might hear the facts. Finally the clergymen of southern California signed a paper agreeing to select a man to represent them in a debate with me. The debate was held in Los Angeles upon four successive evenings. That fanned the fires of hatred of the clergymen against me more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1917 the United States went into war. The clergymen were advocating that the United States go to war. Congress passed the conscription act, or what is better known as the Selective Draft Act, which provided that men who because of religious beliefs could not conscientiously engage in war might be exempted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was asked by many young men in the country as to what course they should take in this regard. In every instance my advice was to this effect, given to young men who requested it, to wit: ‘If you cannot conscientiously engage in war, Section 3 of the Selective Draft Act makes provision for you to file application for exemption. You should register and file your application for exemption, setting forth the reason, and the draft board will pass on your application? I never did more than to advise them to take advantage of the act of Congress. I always insisted that every citizen should obey the law of the land as long as that law was not in conflict with God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On many of the draft boards a clergyman sat as a member of the board, and the applications of these young men setting forth their claims to believe in God and Christ’s kingdom and that they could not conscientiously engage in war greatly angered the clergy, and the fire of hatred continued to increase against our Society. &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tfien a definite conspiracy came to light; and the purpose of that conspiracy was to devise ways and means to destroy our work of proclaiming the truth of God’s Word throughout the land, because the truth exposed the duplicity and hypocrisy of the clergymen and showed that they were not representing God and Christ’s kingdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In furthering that conspiracy a large number of clergymen held a conference in Philadelphia, Pa., in 1917, and at that conference appointed a committee to visit Washington, and insist on a. revision of the Selective Draft</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Act and the Espionage Law. That committee called on the Department of Justice. At that time John Lord O’Brian, of Buffalo, was a member of the Department of Justice at Washington, and at the instance of the clergymen he was selected to prepare an amendment to the Espionage Law and have it introduced in the Senate. The amendment provided that all offenses committed in violation of the Espionage Law should be tried by a military court and the penalty inflicted should be death. That bill </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">did not</span><span class="font7"> pass, for reasons hereinafter stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">General Bell was in command of an army encamped on Long Island, New York. He was a real diplomat, as many will testify who knew the general. He came to visit at my office and spent several hours with me. At that time a number of men connected with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society had been called for military service and were then at the camp under the command of General Bell. All of these were conscientious objectors and had asked to be exempted from military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the occasion mentioned General Bell used his most persuasive methods in his effort to induce me to give these young men instructions to take whatever service he might assign them to take, whether across the sea or otherwise. My answer to the general was this, in<sup>1 </sup>substance: “Every man must decide for himself what he will do; the responsibility is on him, and him alone; he knows what his conscience dictates to him, and it would be very wrong for me to attempt to induce any young man to violate his conscience; I cannot, therefore, tell these young men what they must do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general stated to me that he. needed a letter from me, and insisted that I write a letter to those young men that he could take to them and read, telling them what to do. I declined to do this. Then he said: “Well, can’t you give me some kind of a letter?” Finally I wrote a letter stating, in substance, this to these young men, to wit: “Each one of you must decide for himself whether he wishes to engage in active military service or not. Do what you consider to be your duty and what is right in the sight of Almighty God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That letter was not satisfactory to the general, but really piqued him very much. A few days afterwards W. E. Van Amburgh and myself visited General Bell at his camp on Long Island. His aide-de-camp was present in his office, and on that occasion the general, in the presence of his officer, Brother Van</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 23, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amburgh and myself, repeated to me the fact of the conference of the many clergymen which was held at Philadelphia and which I have just mentioned. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He then told me more about that conference than I had learned before. He told me that the clergymen had selected John Lord O’Brian to present the matter to the Senate; that this resulted in the introduction of a bill to have all cases against the Espionage Law tried before a court martial, a military court, and the punishment death. The bill, when it came to the attention of President Wilson, was stopped, because Wilson would not permit it to be passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general at that time showed considerable heat. Before him on his desk lay a package of papers, and with his index finger he tapped these and, directing his speech to me, with real feeling said: “That bill did not pass, because Wilson prevented it; but we know how to get you, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">we are going to do it!”</span><span class="font7"> To that statement I replied: “General, you will know where to find me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this time I call attention to the fact that Pastor Bussell in his lifetime had written much about Revelation and Ezekiel’s prophecy. After his death, George Fisher and C. J. Woodworth were selected to compile those writings and put them in the form of a book, which was called “The Seventh Volume”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">They ‘ </span><span class="font7">did this work; I did not write anything whatsoever in that book, and the only thing I had to do with it was that I signed a contract on behalf of the Society to have it published. That book, also called “The Finished Mystery”, was issued on the 17th of July, 1917, and had a very wide circulation in different parts of the country. In February, 1918, that book was banned in Canada, and this action was taken by the Canadian government at the instance of the clergymen, as the press reports at that time showed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On February 12,1918, the public press contained the following dispatch from Ottawa, « Canada: “The Secretary of State, under the press censorship regulations, has issued warrants forbidding the possession in Canada of a number of publications, amongst which is the book published by the International Bible Students Association, entitled 'Studies in the Scriptures—The Finished Mystery’, generally known as the posthumous publication of Pastor Russell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The very next day after that order forbidding the circulation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The finished Mystery</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">issued, the books of account of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, at </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font7">Hicks St., Brooklyn, were seized by the department of secret sendee at Washington and carried away for examination. The circumstances show that action was being taken by the Cana<sup>: </sup>dian and the United States government at the same time and the clergymen were backing it up, really urging it to be done. The secular press throughout the country called especial attention to what had been done in Canada and. in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Winnipeg papers had previously announced that certain clergymen had denounced these publications from their pulpits and stated that the attention of the Attorney General had been called to the matter. Later, the Winnipeg </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font7"> after mentioning the order issued by the public censor, said, “The banned publications are alleged to contain seditious and antiwar statements. Excerpts from one of the recent issues of the ‘Bible Students Monthly’ ■were denounced from the pulpit a few weeks ago by Rev. Charles G. Patterson, Pastor of St. Stephen’s Church. Afterward Attorney General Johnson sent to Rev. Patterson for a copy of the publication. The censor’s order is believed to be the direct result.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As further evidence of the nature of this conspiracy, and who the backers of it were, note the following press dispatch of March 5, 1919, which reviewed the case long after and was widely published throughout the nation; “Unduly harsh sentences imposed on a number of persons convicted during the war emergency for violating the espionage act. . . . Acted on today, officials of the department of justice said prisoners had been victims of war-time passion or prejudice. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“ask clemency for eight “Thousands of letters have been received fay the department of justice, asking executive clemency for J. F. Rutherford, head of the , International Bible Students Association, and seven associates now serving sentences in the Atlanta federal prison on charges of disloyalty growing out of publication of the ‘Finished Mystery’, a Bible handbook. These cases were appealed by the convicted men from the federal district court in Brooklyn, and are pending in the appellate court. Officials indicated that no action would be taken in their cases until the appellate court had rendered a decision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the imprisonment of myself and the others, in a public add^ss at Atlanta, Ga., which is quoted by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Constitution </span><span class="font7">of Monday, April 8, 1918, I pointed out the cause of this determined effort to get us out of the way, and said: “Unable to answer the convincing argument that the world has ended and that millions now on earth will never die, and that wonderful blessings will follow to the people after the war, and moved by the spirit of jealousy, the clergy have instituted ’a systematic persecution of us. We have been charged with circulating ‘Hun propaganda’ and being disloyal to the government of the United States. Such charges are base and foul, without a semblance of truth. ... We are not against the war. I have never uttered a sentence to the discredit of the government. I have always held that the government has the authority to declare war and to draft its citizens, and I have only gone to the extent of giving legal advice as to the right of Christians or conscientious objectors to claim exemption or classification under Section 3 of the Selective Draft Act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Returning now to the seizure of the publications, Some time was spent in examining all the books and papers seized, and nothing detrimental was found. Everything we had done here was open and aboveboard. However, some things were seized upon as an excuse to charge us with wrongdoing. Within a short time thereafter a member of the secret service department known as the Intelligence Bureau, a man named Converse, began a systematic visit to my office. He would call and ask a few questions, then retire, and return the next day and do the same thing. Converse time and again intimated that the government was after me. I was certain that there was a real motive back of these daily visits and that it was to entrap me if possible. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To flee the country when likely to be charged with a crime is always evidence of guilt that may be offered to prove guilt. I am certain that the secret service bureau was endeavoring to frighten me in order to induce me to flee, thus to secure evidence to put before a jury and to secure, if possible, my conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Converse continued to hammer away with this undeniable'purpose. On the last occasion of his visit he asked me this question; “The government wants to know where you are going to be the next two' weeks.” I replied: “If I were to come into your office and put that question to you, you would tell me to go somewhere, wouldn’t you?” He responded with feeling: “’Then yon want me to tell the government to go to hell.” I answered: “1 did not say that, but if you wish to construe my language that way, why, take it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then he put this question to me: “The government wants to know what is your itinerary for the next two weeks,” I replied : “Aly itinerary is published in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch. Tower.”</span><span class="font7"> Ue requested a copy, and 1 said: “No, I can't give you a copy; you can have one for five cents if you go down to 17 TUeks St. and buy it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pur th er addressing Mr. Converse, I added: “Converse. 1 am getting tired of your visits here. There is no reason for you to come. 1 have answered all your questions. Now you leave this office, and don’t you ever show your face in here again unless you conic with a warrant for my arrest. And if you do come with. out that I’ll throw you out on your face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Get out.”</span><span class="font7"> Ue left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days thereafter, agreeable to my itinerary, 1 was in Washington, D.C., to deliver a lecture on the subject, “The World Has Ended.” So far as our office had been informed, no one knew at what hotel 1 was going to stop. 1 went to the Raleigh hotel. Evidently I was being shadowed, because I had not been in my room five minutes when my telephone rang and a gentleman announced that he wished to see me. On inquiry as to who he was he said : “I am Judge Harris of Oklahoma.” I said: “All right, come up, Judge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He came to my room, and after a brief conversation he gave me some information which apparently he had from some other source. I had never seen him before, and knew of no reason why he should have any interest in me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He said to me this: “Yow are going to be arrested in a few days, and I just want to give you a tip.” I construed that as another effort to frighten me anti get me to flee. I went to the opera, house and delivered the speech that I had been advertised to deliver and took the next train for New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a few days thereafter the United States marshal appeared at my office with a warrant for my arrest and also that of seven or eight others named in the warrant as to be arrested, charged with a violation of the Espionage Law. The indictment was based chiefly upon a publication of one paragraph of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery,</span><span class="font7"> not one letter of which I ever wrote or had anything to do with. That paragraph is, to wit: “Nowhere in the New Testament is Patriotism (a narrow-minded hatred of other peoples) encouraged. Everywhere and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST. 23, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">always murder in its every form is forbidden; and yet, under the guise of Patriotism the civil governments of earth demand of peace-loving men the sacrifice of themselves and their loved ones and the butchery of their fellows, and hail it as a duty demanded by the laws of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We appeared in court, entered our plea of “not guilty”, and our counsel filed a motion in the case covering some legal points. The attorneys of the case went into chambers with Judge Howe, who had been selected to try the ease, and on that occasion Howe briefly announced: “I propose to give these men all that is coming to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States assistant district attqjmey Butler, a dyed-in-the-wool Catholic, was assigned to prosecute us. Assisting him was Judge Oeland, hired as special counsel, and no doubt hired by the conspirators, even though the government paid the bill. The trial began, and lasted over a period of days, and during that time I frequently saw in company with Judge Oeland and the assistant district attorney Catholic priests conferring with them and advising them what to do. flow they knew about what should be done was strange to me; for they were not acquainted with any of us. That is to say, it might seem strange; but I knew the purpose was to carry out their conspiracy to destroy us if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our trial progressed and divers and numerous prejudicial errors were committed. I recall one thing in particular. A note written by Jack London concerning war had been published some time before the United States got into war, and with that publication I had not the slightest bit to do; yet that was admitted in evidence as my sentiments and the sentiments of my fellow defendants. Time and again the trial judge showed his heat and conviction of our “guilt”, and thus influenced the jury; and this is further shown by the final instructions of the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The case was tried during great excitement; the German army was advancing on Paris, and the papers carried full accounts thereof; bands were in the streets, marching about the courthouse where we were being tried; and great crowds were in tin: streets. Under this setting and in the excitement it was easy to prejudice the people in general against us. Notwithstanding all this, however, the jury hesitated a long while before rendering a verdict. Finally Judge Howe sent word in to them that they must bring in a verdict of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Guilty”, as one of the jurors afterwards stated to us. They did bring in a verdict of “Guilty”, and a sentence of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">80 years</span><span class="font7"> was imposed upon us. We were denied bail, and immediately put in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were incarcerated in the Raymond Street jail, Brooklyn, where we remained for seven days, and then removed to Long Island City, where we were kept in jail until we were taken to the Federal Penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the meantime our attorneys made application before the United States Court of Appeals for bail. Martin T. Manton, the chief justice, assigned the hearing of this bail application to himself, although the application had beeirmade to Judge Ward. Upon hearing the application Manton denied bail without assigning any reason whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we reached the Atlanta penitentiary it was quite evident that the officers had been advised as to what kind of men we were, because they seemed to know all about us. We were warned that we -were not to do any preaching while in the prison. A short time after this, however, a Sunday school was organized at the instance of the deputy warden, and each one of the prisoners was free to attend or not, as he liked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our little party of eight attended and started a class of our own, and within a short time almost all the Sunday school attendants joined our class, to the number of about one hundred in all, and they heard the truth while we were in the prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Referring now to our conviction: You will note the press reports .that the clergy felicitated one another and patted one another on the back, and said to one another, after the verdict of “guilty” was brought in and the sentence imposed: “Now we are through with that pestiferous crowd of Russellites.” They soon had to change their tune. After the case had been heard on appeal, and reversed, I went to every city in tile United States of any consequence and put an advertisement in the leading papers covering an entire page to this effect: “Sentenced to 80 Years in Prison at the Instance of the Clergy. Come and Hear the Reason Why.” And my lectures over a period of two years thereafter burned them up; and their anger has increased ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manton, acting with the other Catholic conspirators, did his best to keep us in prison, as tile court record will show. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ' ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many other interesting points that I might call attention to, but these are the principal ones, and you can get other facts from the court record and other parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note the following from the files of the Clerk of Court dated July 12, 1918:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">United States Circuit Court of Appeals ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Circuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph F. Rutherford, et al. [and others] v.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">United States, Defendant in Error</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A motion having been made before the undersigned as a judge of this court for an orde.r admitting the defendants to bail pending the writ of error herein ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon consideration thereof it is ordered that said motion he and hereby is • denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[signed] Manton, C. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thereafter application was made by attorneys for defendants to the United States Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis. Upon his order another application was made to the Circuit Court of Appeals of New York. </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Af</span><span class="font7">ter nine months from the time of incarceration in prison the defendants were admitted to bail, ten thousand dollars each. This order was made March 21, 1919. On March 29, 1919, the defendants were released from prison. A short time thereafter the case was heard on appeal, and the • judgment was reversed, defendants discharged, and in due time the case was dismissed entirely by the United-States District Attorney up on-ord er of the Attorney General, and all the defendants were therefore automatically fully restored to citizenship and were never at any time convicts within the meaning of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although the Court Records show these facts, the Catholic press for more than twenty years has maliciously, deliberately, dubbed Judge Rutherford as an ex-convict, knowing at the time that they are lying. At the same time they have carried on a campaign of vilification agaifist him and have failed to answer anything charged against them with reference to their religious racket. Contrast that with the fact that the highest man on the United States Court of Appeals is convicted of a most malicious and wicked crime and the same Catholic press</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font9">is absolutely silent about it even to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In view of this malicious effort on the part of the clergy to convict and incarcerate in prison and destroy men of entire innocence, and because those men were preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, the truth, which exposes the duplicity of the clergymen, the readers will be keenly interested in the appeal of this case, the hearing of it, and the opinion rendered by the Court, and particularly in the<sup>-</sup>fact that a majority of the judges found that the defendants were not guilty as convicted and Manton still insisted that they should be kept in prison. This will appear in the next issue.— Elton Groves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The claim is made that an expert on acoustics saved the $50,000,000 steamer Normandie from the junk heap. The vessel vibrated so that it made the passengers sick and the boat became unpopular. The expert, S. K.

If there is a train ahead, the wave travels up one of its wheels on the same rail of the track, then through the axle, and finally returns through the other rail to the transmitting train where a pencil beam of electrons moving across a scale makes visible figures corresponding to the distance and speed of the train ahead. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Arizona wishes to teach its children to he patriotic. Therefore allegedly patriotic groups in the state arrange for the passage of a law which denies any education to any child who refuses to salute the American flag. Recently four Arizona children whose parents belong to a religious sect which bans such salutes were expelled from an Arizona school on the basis of this law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We submit that this is not patriotic and is certainly not education for patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No evidence has appeared that these children are not patriotic. There is, however, ample evidence that these children and all Arizona children are being carefully trained in a false idea of what constitutes patriotism. It would appear that Arizona children are being taught that forms and gestures constitute patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It appears that these children who have been thrown out of school have been told in actions which speak far louder than words that patriotism is a vicious, coercive and antireligious doctrine which denies them their democratic rights to individual freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not by making people outcasts that we can create patriots. If this country is not big enough and strong enough and fine enough to inspire that love which comes from the heart, if the only patriotism on which this nation can depend is the lip service which is forced from unwilling citizens by fear of punishment, then there is no patriotism and can be no patriotism in America. Let us root out the idea that the country should adopt the practice of tyrants and dictators who demand the form at the point of a bayonet and who forget the substance which we in America have always cherished and should continue to cherish.— </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Arizona Daily Star.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ I have been in the cotton belt the most of my life (am now past 70) and have seen the time I could pick 500 pounds per day. It ii a very poor picker that cannot get as much as 150 pounds, and there are many that can pick 400 pounds to 600 pounds per day. The price for picking here this year has been 75c per 100 pounds; so you see the wages are not so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes the hands swell for the first three or four days and then quit. If the fingers crack we protect them with adhesive tape and. they soon get well. As to the. back, of course it aches. So do one’s legs, when not used to it; the same with any other part of the body at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You have this advantage in picking cotton which you do not have at some other jobs: you can get on your knees and rest your back and pick just as much and sometimes more that way. Men, women and children all pick during the season and make good money doing so. —A. H. Austin, Arizona.</span></p>

It would cover the whole state of New York to the depth of a foot. The dam itself is 660 feet thick at tjie base, and 45 feet thick at the top. It is in a gorge so narrow that its crest is only 1,282 feet long. It is the largest structure on earth. When you visit the dam you are first taken down 44 stories in an elevator.

<p><span class="font7">After working my territory for fully five hours on a hot and sultry day with no response but opposition and indifference, I finally approached the last house in the block, preparatory to moving on to another “milder” zone. A young girl answered the bell and, after reading the testimony card, firmly refused to call her mother to the door. After a minute of friendly coaxing which got us nowhere, her mother, noting her delay at the door, presented herself and demanded an explanation of my mission there. Immediately I presented the phonograph, offering to play a disc in explanation. The offer was accepted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and.

<p><span class="font7">After playing the two discs “Jehovah” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">“Riches”, I presented the literature, but seemingly did not stir up enough interest in her; so I left a booklet free and prepared to depart. At this point the lady said to me: “I have a sick father here in the house who is bedridden at this time. He is more interested than I in these matters. Being that he has been so </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font7">spondent today, would you be so kind as to play a disc for him in his presence?” I replied that it would be a real pleasure to do so. I accompanied her to her father’s bedroom, which was purposely dimly lighted. After the preliminaries, salutations, etc., I received a half-hearted consent to play one disc. I selected “Jehovah”, playing that through without any comment from the old gentleman, and quickly putting on the disc “Riches” and continuing.' Everything went on quietly until the part was reached announcing the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font7"> As if shocked by an electric current, the old man sat upright in bed and barely whispered : “Is it true ? Can it be true ? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches’</span><span class="font7"> Has Jehovah answered me?” Settling back on his pillow he searched me with eager eyes until the disc was finished. Immediately it was over he began to question me with a quivering voice. “Tell me, who are you? Did Jehovah send you ? He must have, as only today, yes, this morning, I prayed that He might send me that book. Have you it with you? Tell me, man. Speak!” Something choking-like was in my throat, and tears welling rapidly in my eyes. I managed somehow to speak, asking him to explain as to his knowledge of the existence of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font7"> His reply was that fully a year had passed since he was presented with a radio folder describing the book. That was in Parana, a state adjacent to Sao Paulo. He was unable at the time to contribute for a copy, and later lost the folder, and consequently the branch office address. From that time on he was constantly on the lookout for one of Jehovah’s witnesses and praying to Jehovah daily that he might procure a copy. That very morning he had stated to his daughter: “If only I had that book</span></p>

Court” which appears on the last page of the issue of August 15, 1939. That story concludes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In just one little town, Carencro, we were put in jail three times. They took everything away from us, even our Bible. And then the priest had all our windows boarded up so that we could not witness to the people through the bars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Carencro priest orders police to shut off light and air, true Inquisition style, as shown, but habeas corpus proceedings make his jackass collar set him off perfectly.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">America still has laws, lawyers and judges, and so it took but a little while for &gt;&nbsp;Attorney Herman L. Midlo to get the prisoners out on a writ of habeas corpus, and to exhibit the priest to his community as the perfect jackass which his collar proclaims him to be. In some other places the jackass fraternity is awakening, or at least stirring slightly in its sleep. Thus, in its issue of June 25, 1939, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font7"> organ of the Roman Catholic bishop, J. Noll, admitted on its front page the self-evident truth that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rutherford should be refuted. We’d be much wiser to devote our time to answering the arguments. Deprive your enemies of free speech, and your enemies will some day deprive you of your rights. Certainly Rutherford is making capital of Catholic attempts to have him silenced. Fortunately we seem to have given up our misguided efforts -along those lines, but there is still a bitter aftertaste from the previous mistakes. We can. prove our claims as supporters of liberty only by helping protect the liberty even of those with whom we disagree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bishop Noll should bestow his labors on the priestly jackass of Carencro, and do it right away, before the story gets out of how he fell down on his Inquisition job, But maybe the bishop is depressed by the faet that the word Carencro means a place where buzzards assemble, and he may sometime have seen and smelled buzzards feeding on the body of a dead jackass. A sniff of the original Carencro diet is very thought - pr ovok in g.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Birth of a Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Three months ago our group of five publishers arrived in Douglas, Arizona, to bring the Kingdom message to the people of this town of 10,000 population. There was no goodwill interest on the file, and no company organization. We parked our trailers at the edge of town and began witnessing. We wrote down the street and number of houses where no one was at home, and later called again to insure </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">thorough witness. Witnessing first in the residence district, we were soon spending our evenings making back-calls on people of good will. New subscriptions were obtained, and we found people who were hungry for the truth. Next the business district received the witness, literature was placed, and new subscriptions obtained here. The virgin territory was all gone, all having been visited at least once.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">At this point opposition showed up. “I cannot take any of those books,” replied one woman, “because I have taken an oath giving my word of honor—and I never break my word—that I would not read any of those books. Our priest asked us to take this oath and I have done so. I wish you good luck, though.” M. F. McCue, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce (guess his church), sent statements to the Douglas </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Dispatch</span><span class="font7"> and a number of “news” items were printed. (Clippings enclosed) Branded as “Publie Nuisance No. 1 in this city” we were falsely accused of being into the homes and remaining for hours”.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Other false statements were made and we were . who in 1539 came to Arizona, “for the glory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">charged with being “pests” and “religious fanatics”. As a sample of how “true” these “news” items were, note this; It was not until we were through witnessing in the town that the items were published, and it was stated that then “the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce is receiving dozens of phone calls daily”. Copper cards were then printout, and issued to householders, warning peddlers not to knock unless they had a permit in writing from the Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One man, a Baptist, heard the speeches “Warning” and “Face the Faets” in his home, was well pleased with them, and said, “What have you done to get this before the public? It is truth! Next time you come back I.will have all my friends from the Baptist church here, the preacher, and the elders, and the deaeons.” When we came back, his friends were not there; and he was a different man. Confronted .with choosing between the truth and his friends, this man chose his “friends”. “Protestant'” clergy'chi med in with the opposition and became opposers. “When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou give st thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue fra meth decei t ” (Psalm 50:18,19) As a result, some of the common people were led to believe that Jehovah’s witnesses were undesirable and had left town—destination unknown. Some said, “I hear that they have been kicked out of town.” Apparently the Opposition had succeeded in driving out Jehovah’s witnesses, and the opponents were jubilant. Perhaps it added to their joys to know that Arizona has a swastika sign on all state highway markers, and this year is celebrating the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Fray Marcos de the first white man to tread Arizona’s soil;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of God and the King of Spain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However much to the dislike of opponents, the story does not end*here. A key meeting was held under the direction of the zone servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Counter-activities were planned. Some of the people of good will of the town who did not approve such highhanded actions wrote letters to the local paper, and they were published. “Fascism or Freedom” was the subject of a public meeting held in the Odd Fellows hall in Douglas, On Saturday evening the day before the meeting an information march was held.

<p><span class="font7">♦ Our two little hoys, 7 and 9 years, in the second grade, have never saluted the flag. Nothing was said about it for a long time. Then came the day (patriotic week, I think) when their teacher called the principal of their school in to see about it. He questioned them as to why they refused to salute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Glenn Paul, who is 7, answered like this: “Saluting the flag is loving the flag more than Jehovah, and if we love anything more than Jehovah we can not live in the Kingdom, and we want to live in the Kingdom.’’ Floyd, who is 9, added: “And if you don’t believe that is true, we can bring you a book to prove it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The teacher asked for the book, took </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty,</span><span class="font7"> contributed the penny, and the next day said to Floyd, “Well, Floyd, you were right after all.” They still have the flag salute. but our little boys stand and say the pledge, but are not required to salute. On one occasion there was a school play in which there was a flag drill. Glenn Paul did not wish to be in the flag drill, and the teacher said she would find some other place for him.

<p><span class="font7">♦ At Napoleonville, Louisiana, in the trial of two of Jehovah’s witnesses, a gpntieman testified that he had learned more about God and His kingdom in six weeks from the Watchtower publications than he had learned in 48 years with the Catholic church. This man is now taking the phonograph around, playing it for his friends, and telling them that if they want everlasting life they should abandon religion and learn the Bible. At the same little village the teachers told the children to inform their parents that if any persons had any Watchtower literature they should report to the Napoleonville courthouse. They had no more right or reason to do this than to require them to bring in all their underwear and socks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The restriction of conscience apparent in the adverse decisions of the Supreme Court in the Macintosh and Schwimmer cases should cause real alarm to thoughtful citizens in this country. If the state can conscript the conscience of its people it has progressed far in the direction of totalitarianism. Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth on their side when they see in flag salutes, oaths of loyally, and military service even for the objectors a dangerous idolatry which threatens the true worship of God. We should labor to maintain a constant vigilance for a free church. It is our legacy as Americans and our only hope of a victory for democracy and religious freedom. ■—Reverend Stephen Fritchman, Bangor, Maine, in an address at Orono University.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Paley’s Sickening Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ -William S. Paley, president of the Columbia Broadcasting System, is out with a statement urging that every person should “have the right to use the microphone within the limits of- decency and the laws of libel”, and yet flatly refused to sell time, to Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast the good news of God’s kingdom as the hope of the world. Indeed all who fawn before the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are quick to ape its sickening hypocrisy, which in the same breath proclaims that it is the great spokesman for human liberty and demands the right to murder “heretics”, that is, persons disagreeing with its teachings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ I am a pioneer and on the roof of my ear have a large sign mounted which reads: “Religion is a snare and a racket; Serve God and Christ the King. Jehovah’s witnesses.” One day while'witnessing in the city I had the car parked outside a school and the children were just coming out when three boys, 12 to 13 years of age, stopped to read. The first said, “That guy in that ear is nuts.” The second said, “I think it takes guts to sit in it”; and the third said, “Well, he has more nerve than I have.” Every knock is a boost.—J. James, Canada.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses Amused</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Jehovah’s witnesses are amused when they read that 5,200,000 copies of fifeiji </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kampf </span><span class="font7">were sold, and brought $3,536,000 in royalties to Hitler. The same papers that mention this huge output of books somehow never find room for a line that more than fifty times as many of Judge Rutherford’s books have been placed in the hands of the people, that they are a million times better books, and that the people get them at much less per volume than 10 percent of the charge made for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf.</span></p><img src="g_E_19390823_files/g_E_19390823-14.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:74pt;">
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE RANK AND FILE of the conservative people of all nations desire peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Relying upon worldly religious leaders such people are often victims of deception. If they have confidence in their religious leaders, they are almost certain to be deceived at the present time by such professed supporters of peace but who, in fact, are against peace. A hypocrite is a deceiver. Hypocrisy is the practice of that which results in deceiving others. The following definitions are taken from the standard lexicographers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">* Hypocrite : One who plays a part for the ' purpose of winning approbation or favor, or feigns to be other and better than he is; a false pretender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hypocrisy: Act or practice of feigning to be what one is not; false form or appearance of virtue or religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The newspapers published by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy reporting the death of the late pope Pius emphasize the statement that the last word uttered by him upon his deathbed was, “Peace.” When the present pope, Pacelli, was elected, the same papers published the statement that his first word as pope was, “Peace.” It is exceedingly doubtful whether there is any truth in the published statements. Doubtless the pope on his deathbed said nothing about peace and the same is true with reference to theuncoming pope; but such publication was for the purpose of deceiving the people. The acts of the late pope and the acts of the present pope directly and emphatically contradict advocacy or desire for peace. The undisputed facts are these: The cruel war prosecuted by Franco, the Catholic, against Spain, in which many harmless persons were murdered, was fully approved by the pope. The pope not only advocated and supported such war, but he pronounced his blessings upon it. When Franco entered Barcelona his first act was to perform mass at the instance of the pope. The real purpose of that war was to put Spain under the control of the FascistCatholic combine. The further fact that Fascist Italy prosecuted a war of conquest against Abyssinia, in which many harmless persons were killed, and that the pope endorsed that war and placed his blessing upon it,. directly contradicts his “desire” for peace. The totalitarian government that rules Germany and has recently grabbed Austria, and wrecked Czechoslovakia, and other European countries, and threatens to plunge all Europe into war, has had the full endorsement of both the late and the present pope. The present pope is a shrewd politician, who is playing the game of politics that will lead the nations into war. Inconsistency, hypocrisy, is stamped indelibly upon the acts of the late pope, as well as those of the present pope. Their supposed advocacy of peace has deceived and is deceiving many gullible or credulous persons who really desire peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present-day situation is exactly a fulfillment of prophecy recorded centuries ago in the Scriptures. Jerusalem was typical of “Christendom”. Jerusalem had forgotten her obligation to God. In “Christendom”, where the Papacy, political-religious combine takes the lead, these claim to serve God, but serve the Devil. The words of Jehovah’s prophet Jeremiah apply primarily to Jerusalem, but apply with greater force today to the religious leaders, and particularly to the Papacy, to wit: &quot;For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.”—Jeremiah 6:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Papacy covets that which does not belong to her, namely, to rule the earth. The Papacy tries to deceive the people in order to gain complete control of them, and to allay the fears of the people the Papacy pretends to be for peace and cries out, “Peace, peace”; “when there is no peace.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There will be no peace on earth until after Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and in which Satan’s organization, including the religious institutions, shall be completely destroyed. Then the Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, will rule the world in peace and righteousness. Those who trust in the Lord and obey Him will be the only ones who wi] 1 find the place of safety from that terrible disaster and who will thereafter dwell in: peace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We are not blind to the lessons of the wars in Spain and China. We do not want war. We hate war. But if they force war upon us we shall not hesitate to fight them with every weapon at our command and fight them tenfold on their own ground.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The U.S.S.R. wants peace, not war. It has no aggressive designs or intentions, but let its enemies realize that that is not a sign of weakness.

Or a child of 9 being sold to a man of 55 for two horses, a cow and 500 rubles of silver? Or women of 14 or 15 years of age who were sent to a stable or to the woods to give birth to their babies alone? It is one of the prides of Soviet Russia that many of these former child brides of Czarist days are now serving as lawyers, engineers, teachers, aviators, and editors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A graphic illustration of how news of sensational cures by chiropractic, is withheld from the public is the story of little Daisy &quot;Waller. All over the land, in 1937, newspapers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">carried the story of this eight-year-old Atlanta, Ga., girl, over whose beautiful face a mask of stone was slowly'- forming and whose body was gradually turning to rock. The newspapers kept the public in touch -with this petrifying child, then suddenly she was no longer news. Why? Because she had been cured by a chiropractor I Since the medicos couldn't afford to have the newspapers print the truth that this medically doomed girl was ; • cured by chiropractic, silence was the policy adopted by the Medical Trust. But:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The stone mask that four years ago crept over the lovely features of little Daisy Waller, eight, victim of the rare malady, sclerodcrmia, slowly but surely turning her to stone, today is gone. The lethargy has lifted —leaving no trace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The child who once was doomed to death because the tissues of her body were petrifying, now is playing in her front yard on South Candler Road, apparently the picture of health. She said yesterday: “I feel good now, just as though 1 had never been sick. I can play baseball all day long if I want to and ride my bicycle and I can eat anything I want.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“My teacher sent me home,” she had told her mother, who. immediately put the child to bed. For weeks the malady progressed with alarming speed. She was gradually losing use of her limbs and a strange hardening process of the tissues became apparent to the touch. The muscles began to lose their resiliency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">j*. After a number of consultations the child’s con-✓ dition was said to be hopeless. Her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. C. II. Waller, and her six sisters and two brothers watched her condition with a feeling of despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the family lawyer recommended an Atlanta chiropractor with the hope that the child could be brought to recovery. Eight weeks alter the beginning of the disease Daisy was X-rayed and treatment began. Following the adjustment made three days following the X-ray the child began to respond, and in three weeks a marked change was noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Her condition resulted from a misplacement of the Atlas vertebra, or the top vertebra, which caused a deposit of mineral salts in the body due to the fact that nature was unable to control the manufacture and elimination of the lime and. phosphate salts, it was explained.</span></p>

There is everywhere among intelligent Americans the greatest interest in and acquaintance with European affairs?’ That the conclusions the American draws from his observation of the European gangrene may differ from our own is not a sufficient reason for concluding them to be erroneous,—IT.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Scribner’s Magazine</span><span class="font7"> lasted 52 years, and passed out recently, after a brilliant businessman prophesied that he would raise the circulation to 350,000. First he fired all the old editors .that knew anything about their work. He put on specialists that knew everything about everything, except running a magazine. Finally, after running out encash and out of ideas, the whole enterprise went kerplunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19</span></p><img src="g_E_19390823_files/g_E_19390823-18.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:74pt;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Catholic International</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Vatican knows everything about the nations of the world and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font7"> know nothing about it: therein lies its power. A tide of varied documents flows into Rome every day from all points of the globe in which Catholics live. These are read carefully, then catalogued in the secret archives which form an incomparable documentary source, but which are closed to the laymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was Gregory the Seventh who appointed the first eeelesiastieal legates to sovereigns. The novelty was not to the taste of them all, and William the Conqueror is reported to have informed the pope: “I am a dutiful son of the Church, but if your legate sets foot in my Duchy of Normandy, I warn you that he will find himself strung up to the highest oak in my forests.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thereupon the Papacy abandoned this system, entrusting its intelligence service to monks established in the country, hidden </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">monasteries, or to wandering friars, who traveled about all the time. Later, the Jesuits took charge of espionage. And eventually the 17th century saw brilliantly clever ambassadors appointed. They were usually laymen of parts who had been raised to the nobility for this very purpose. The last step was taken, though, when the Papacy created a corps of ecclesiastical diplomats who are educated in the Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles. This system is in force today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The majority of countries at the present time maintain relations with the Vatican. Examples of the roles, diverging from limited positions to those of privilege, played by the Roman Catholic Church in many countries are to be found in United States, Belgium, Italy, Germany and the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States the expansion of Romanism was hindered by the division of the Catholic faithful into German, Irish, French and Italian sections, and by the ferociously individualistic “American spirit” which was hostile to all foreign supervision. The Vatican really failed to understand the American mentality and made many mistakes. Neverthe-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">less, sincere Americans seem to be unaware of the underground work carried on by the Vatican in the United States and regard tales of such as harmless, European figments. This indifference will some time prove their undoing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As recently as 1936, the Vatican, in the person of Cardinal Paeelli, secretary of state, made a trip to prospect this most promising client: a rough estimate of the money available from American Catholics being six billion francs. He was feted by the president, met all the important clergy, bankers and business men. It was even said that Mussolini had advised the cardinal to do some tempting favors for Fascist financiers in the United States. While at the present time diplomatic relations between the U. S. and the Vatican do not exist, be sure they will come in time. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Germany at the time of the advent of Hitler, about one-third of the population were Catholic adherents. Since then, with the watertight treaty negotiated by Von Papen, a Jesuit agent, with the Vatican, a minor war has broken out between the Naris and the Church: over the young people and their education. Catholic periodicals and organizations were suppressed, to which the Vatican replied but feebly, leaving its clergy and faithful in the lurch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Similarly, the Jesuits got control in mutilated Austria after the war. Socialist Austria was abandoned by her war-time allies but was given a loan, the control of which was in the hands of Mgr. Seipel, former treasurer of the Company of Jesus [Society of Jesuits]. The sole program was to defeat socialism and prepare a diplomatic combination, in favor of the return of the Ilapsburgs, also agents of the Vatican. Dollfuss has been seen to wipe out the Austrian workers. (He was a pupil of the Jesuits.) Since then [written prior to March, 1938—Ed.], Schusschnigg is preparing the ground by organizing the Christian state on a corporative basis, a method planned by the Company of Jesus. He is suppressing universal suffrage, organizing legitimatist manifestations with the aid of the army, paramilitary formations and the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">History and contemporary events have shown the Church's actions to be governed by circumstances. In the event, of war, she, will flatter the victor and sympathize with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">vanquished. And if there are undeveloped countries (such as China, Japan and Asia generally) she is omnipresent, supporting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSOLATION </span><span class="font7">nationals or the foreign oppressors </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">after an </span><span class="font7">examination of their respective merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For instance, with the downfall of the Russian tsars, the Vatican was gleefully envisaging itself as assuming the mantle of the departed masters. So it showered the Soviet Republic with attentions. But the latter were suspicious. Catholic missionaries of charity were sent into Russia, but accomplished nothing. The present pope was actually nunzio at Warsaw, Poland, at the time of the tlussian advance on that city; he represented the diplomatic corps and concluded an agreement with the Soviet authorities should the Poles be defeated. The opportunity, however, to carry out the scheme did not materialize.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">While the Holy See is always observed to tie up with other confessions in time of war, revol u tionan d inte r nal distresses, Big Business is really the very marrow of Catholicism, and this is the ease despite the disparity between this fact and the early teachings of the Church Fathers. . . . “All those who were possessed of lands or houses sold them, brought the prices thereof and placed them at the feet of the apostles; and they were distributed to each according to his need,” says the Acts of the Apostles, 4:35, which Saint Ambrose in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">De Officiis:</span><span class="font7"> i seconds thus: “Nature has engendered common rights; it is their usurpation which makes for the law of privilege.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But in feudal times such subversive doctrines were stopped. Saint Augustine was the first to realize that the Christian doctrine would never be acceptable in its pure state to men of position, and began to speak of “Human right” and “Divine Right.” Thus the Christian doctrine was modified to keep it from disappearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No one knows the actual riches of the Church, Ip this respect the statement of Count Alexander Feftitle h, who attempted to bring about agrarian reform in Hungary and tried to help the peasantry by'breaking up church holdings in that country, is significant. He has stated that the Catholic Clergy of Hungary possessed 1,325,000 acres of church reserves and that “one-third of the national riches in Spain is represented in property and goods possessed by Roman Catholic congregations. ... The C hemins de Fer du Nord, the Transatlantic Company, the orange groves of Andalusia, the mines of the Basque province and the Riff, several factories in Barcelona, are under the control of religious powers. ...” In addition, in many countries Catholic organizations have grouped numbers of peasants into buying and selling cooperatives, aided by auxiliary banks which are naturally controlled by the big Catholic banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the advent of Fascism, the Banco</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">di Roma, the bank of the Catholic nobility, of the Vatican and religious orders, almost went bankrupt. An appeal was made and Mussolini softened to the tune of 700,000,000 lira, which saved the bank. The Lateran Treaty was in process of preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The failure of economic sanctions during the Abyssinian war and the favorable attitude of the Vatican is easily explained. When the sanctionist countries suppressed the transfer of funds and “Peter’s Pence” which were represented in foreign and Italian banks, money could not reach Rome. So the “frozen assets” of the Vatican were transferred ingeniously to the credit of the Italian state which thus effected purchases abroad, while the Italian treasury credited the Vatican with an equivalent sum in lira at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the matter of social welfare, the Church took a stand only after a century of hesitation, when the class struggle was making the outlook dangerous to the bourgeois order. Actually it has always been the custom of the church to intervene only in time to steal to the side of the victor. She never compromises herself. Therefore, in issuing the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">QuaAragesi-mo Anno</span><span class="font7"> Encyclical on social conditions, the Vatican simply slipped its calling card under the door of the oppressed but abstained from giving them the means to free themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite one of the tenets of the church, “All men are brothers,” diplomatic history of the Vatican shows that the Holy See has unceasingly fomented wuirs or taken part in them as a sovereign power. But these acts had, of course, to be justified in the eyes of “Christendom”. Thus, in a pastoral letter from Cardinal Goma, primate of Spain, as recently as , February 10, 1937, the Church explains: “Every creature has the right to wage war against another when the latter is warring against God. War is the daughter of the abuse man has made of liberty: she is the daughter of sin. We must accept if God test a nation in war as a punishment for its prevarications and as a stimulant in case of decadence of the moral order. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is very suggestive in view of the fact that the attitude of the Vatican has been violently criticized during the war in all countries and especially by the Entente nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first place, when war broke out, the world waited in vain for a protest from the Vatican concerning the invasion of Belgium (a staunch Catholic country).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope . . . was caught between two fires: his diplomatic corps were pro-German . and at the same time he needed to defend his political interests and see to the expansion of the Church. Only the victory of the Central Powers would favor his plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So the most impartial of the prelates could do no more than weigh the respective chances of both sides to see which would win out. The balance not having been weighed in favor of the Allies till -August, 1918, it was then understood why the Vatican had waited throughout the war before taking a clear stand. But it was too late to save face and pretend to a role ■ of arbitration ... the Allies had saved themselves. As a result the Holy See was put out of the peace negotiations, the League of Nations, and excluded from all diplomatic activity, which injured it throughout the world. It was a humiliating defeat.—By Raymond A. Dior.

<p><span class="font7">The United Press says that “despite Vatican denials” .that the pope had called or thought of calling a five-power conference to try to establish European peace, yet “the idea of such a conference was originally advanced”, which is a nice way of saying' that the pope lied. The same story suggests that the pope made a big mistake in not inviting Russia to the conference. This might be true, for both England and France feel the need of Russian support.</span></p>

Somebody has to stay behind to rake in the shekels. In face of these facts, just what would you think of the value of the Associated Press dispatch from Quebec that, on June 26, “one hundred thousand priests participated in the final procession,”' etc. Probably there were more than one thousand priests, but the Catholic reporter on the job thought he would make it look as big as possible. And he did, and jaekassed his job. The Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font7"> reported 4,000 clergymen in the procession.

<p><span class="font7">♦ When a couple of cronies have robbed a henroost together, and divided the spoils fairly, it is but natural that when they have another similar job in view they should approach one another with feelings of mutual regard. The pope invited the prime ministers and foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Poland to meet together at the Vatican to discuss the carving up of Poland, the understanding being that at the last minute he would come into the picture as the great and wise statesman of the latest </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Munich </span><span class="font7">fiasco. This would not be so hard, because Poland is already completely under his thumb, and it would be a very easy matter for him to make a deal on the side with der Fiibrer and give him what he wants. In view of this setup, is it any wonder that the dispatches telling, about this offer set forth the interesting observation that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chancellor Adolf Hitler received the Papal nuncio, who brought him this proposal, with the greatest respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman Catholic Sympathy with Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Roman Catholic sympathy with Hitler is seep in the dispatches from Dublin that not only would De Valera and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy not do anything to prevent Hitler from overrunning the British Isles, but they would and did use all their influence to prevent conscription even in Protestant Ulster. In another World War the Roman Catholic Hierarchy would stand just where it stood before, that is, against the democracies and for their opposites, the autarchies.</span></p>

Mussolini has a large interest in the Montecatini Chemical Trust, which supplied most of the explosives for the war in Spain. In four years the concern made a profit of $380,000,000, and Mussolini is now a millionaire, like his friend and enemy Hitler. *</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">forced by the history of recent years than that the suppression of discussion leads directly to tyranny and the loss of all other civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fixed policy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is that it can and should break up any meeting of which it disapproves by threats of starting a riot. This has been done time and again by the Hierarchy as respects Jehovah’s witnesses. The Bar Association does not mention the Hierarchy, but does say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A small number of lawless men by passing the word around that they intend to start a riot could prevent any kind of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On any such theory, a gathering which expressed the sentiment of law-abiding citizens would be forbidden merely because a small gang of hoodlums threatened to break up the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only proper remedy for such situations, small or serious, is the police protection to which citizens are entitled in public places, whether they are there singly or in groups. It is the duty of the officials, to prevent or suppress the threatened disorder with a firm hand instead of timidly yielding to threats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outdoor meeting is especially well adapted to the promotion of unpopular causes, since such causes are likely to command little financial support and therefore must often be promoted by persons who do not have the financial means to “hire a hall” or purchase time on the .radio.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The American Guardian,</span><span class="font7"> December 30, 1938.</span></p>

For 2,000 years we have had Christianity.

It is difficult to imagine a more appalling world than we have today. Each day brings us news of new forms of horror.

<p><span class="font7">♦ The manufacture of hypocrites occasionally runs into a snag, because the young are not naturally dishonest. They have to learn it from the previous generation. At Mercer University, a Baptist college in Macon, Georgia, thirteen students of theology sent out letters to 1,000 Baptist ministers charging that their professors, five of them, teach that the Bible is not inspired, that Adam and Eve were myths, that the Bible is contradictory, “that it was not necessary for Christ to die,” and that “it is unnecessary to believe in Jesus Christ to be saved”. Without a doubt these'' courageous young men have told the truth. The only thing for them to do is to<sup>;</sup> quit the religious business altogether. They cannot bring soundness to something that is rotten to the core. Let them turn to Jehovah and His ,Word, serve God and Christ, and let the theological professors go where they will go any-<sup>1 </sup>way, and where they already are, into the hands of the Devil, whom they serve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The church is not supposed to be a fahey club or art institute, nor a dimly lit chamber of fear and goose pimples. Clergymen who must rely on such artificial devices to influence an audience are simply poor public speakers.</span></p>

At a cost of $4,000 the congregation built another and planned a celebration in February, 1939, to mark the burning of the last note. Just as the note was about to be burned the building took fire from an overheated flue and burned to the ground. Maybe somebody in the community will get the truth, now that the religious business is so poor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">they discovered something else of interest. About -three miles away they came on an Indian village that had never before been visited by white men. The human relations of these happy Indians were described as practically perfect.

<p><span class="font7">♦ The London iVews </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font7"> claims that some-South American farmers (country not stated) have as many as a thousand peons on their vast estates. These peons are virtual slaves of the landowner or moneylender, they have no recourse to the authorities, and if they try to escape they are usually arrested and sent back by the police to be locked up in private prisons on the farms. It would be interesting to know what happens in those private prisons. Anybody who looks eagerly' forward to a “hell” for some of his fellow men deserves at least a few days as a guest in one of these institutions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The offer of free land in Bolivia attracted many Americans, but some can still remember the rush of Americans to the same land in 1920 and that most of those who went were glad to come back. The lands offered are remote from the frontiers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The Fascist state of Bolivia is now well tied up to Germany; its Congress was dissolved, its constitution was suspended, and the former leaders of the Opposition were confined in a concentration camp on an island in Lake Titicaca. Four million marks’ worth of minerals, hides and petroleum were bartered for German manufactured goods, and Germany will figure on building pipe lines to bring Bolivian oil to the seacoast. Germany needs the oil for the planes. The American Department of State always seems well pleased when another state goes Fascist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">British Commeht</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Hemery (London)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Big Business</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Recently the Government of Britain, through its appointed minister, advised the people to get a moderate store of such foods as can safely be kept for a few weeks, in readiness for the emergency of an outbreak of war. Of course, when war comes, as is generally believed it will come, it will be suddenly, and every service in the country will be dislocated for a time. Then the Government would put all food supplies under control and foodhoarding would be made an offense, as in the Great War. Some provision for food in wartime has been made by the authorities: it is said that large supplies of cereals have been acquired, particularly wheat; but purchased in such a way as not'to disturb the usual channels of trade. But the chance of making money is not being missed by Big Business. A Labor ' representative raised a case in Parliament, calling attention to the action of a combination of London firms. Backed by their money resources these men entered into an agreement with merchants in Japan for the purchase of huge surplus supplies of tinned salmon, the price involving millions of pounds sterling. Perhaps the salmon taken from the waters of Japan are as wholesome and worth as much as food as Canadian salmon, which so largely add to the food of Britain. And it may be that Canada is unable to supply the amount which these merchants were contracting for. The point of the Labor member’s question is the readiness of these men to trade with a nation which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">its political actions is acting as an enemy of the country, and that the food of British people should be stoned from enemy sources. Also, it was pointed out that the Government does little or nothing to put the fishing industry of Britain into such order and on such </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">basis as would prevent the great waste of the herring season. Millions of herrings are thrown back into the sea because there is no profitable market, and the once lively fishing industry, which provided the country for both trade and in war with a hardy race of inen </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">its navy, and gave employment to a very considerable number of men and women, is fast becoming one of the failing industries. It does seem that those who complain of the Government’s failure to make a real endeavor to adjust the situation and restore the industry have good cause for what they say. The war and the political game since 1918 have destroyed Britain’s foreign market for herring. Before the war came in 1914, millions of barrels of the herring were shipped, uncured, to Germany and to Russia; now neither of those countries is purchasing from Britain.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The newspapers tell of sales of ore to Germany by France: ore that goes immediately to the production of war armaments; and of heavy shipments of ivheat to Germany by Canada, stores for Germany in time of the war they say they know must come, ‘because their enemies are bent upon attacking them.’ Big Business is very patriotic when talking patriotism pays, but “Business first” is its motto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Isolation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The apostle Paul said: “God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, . . . hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined . . .the bounds of their habitation.” (Acts 17: 24-26) It is common knowledge that men give little heed to the Creator and to His goodness, also stated by Paul: “Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.” (Acts 14:17) The great among men give no heed, and therefore no thanks, to the Giver of all good; and the learned according to the wisdom of this world (which includes the college-trained clergy class) deny in words or effect these words of Paul and which are, of course, taken from God’s own statement of His work. (See Genesis chapters 1-3.) Politicians in the nations want isolation. Some politicians or would-be politicians in Britain want to have the varied nations inside the “British Empire” welded into an isolation group. Hitler has gone one better: he is determined to isolate his German subjects into a nation of one blood, and set them on the pinnacle of the nations. Even if a disruptive war should not break out, the idea could not succeed, since God did not will it from the first. The nations are finding out by sheer necessity that they cannot be isolationists : nations nor men can live apart. The great idea of each nation’s being self-sustain</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">ing and independent of other nations has brought about the barriers of trade protection and the curse of passports, to the hurt of each of them. One newspaper proprietor with a big chance of thrusting his isolationist views on millions of readers and who made himself a crusader for the cause has had to admit France into his limited British Empire scheme; for in the face of European dangers Britain cannot continue without association with France, as France cannot apart, from Britain. Also facts show that the nations which agree with Britain in calling the king of England their king love themselves better than they love the &quot;mother” country. They are as children grown up each with his family responsibility and only a family relationship to the parent. It is not love, but money, and also fear, that binds the &quot;empire” into unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Incidentally a letter in the press from the ^-president of the Bureau of Imports, Auckland, N.Z., points out that the Labor government of New Zealand is damaging importers’ interests by prohibiting bringing into New Zealand &quot;a host of goods” from Britain. It is the settled policy of the Labor government of New Zealand to limit the amount of British imports, which seems a rather one-sided matter when it is on record that Britain purchases 85 percent of the product of New Zealand, buying annually to almost £50,000,000, and being able to export only a little more than half that value of goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both of the two warlike dictators Hitler and Mussolini are aggressive isolationists, even though at present neither can do without the other. Germany cries out to the world that its people need living room, but it im-norts scores of thousands of Italians to enable I to carry on with its needs. These two men '&quot;-are both obsessed with a revival of the old Roman empire, each for himself. Hitler has got some of its relics from Austria, and Mussolini is on the spot in Rome with a grip on Mediterranean lands. It is the idea of power and authority and military strength that possesses them. But there is a great difference between the liberty of Rome in its days of world dominion and.that which these graspers for power give to their subjects. The bounds of the Roman empire stretched from these western islands of Britain to Babylonia in the far east, and no passport was needed inside that wide stretch of lands. Rome’s rule was military, but was benevolent towards the Various peoples in its empire. It is true that the emperor Hadrian built a wall across the north of England to keep the Scots out, but, though it still exists, it has never been much of a barrier: the Scots still come south and are ever welcome; nor did it keep Edward the Second from raiding Scotland, and ultimately getting a severe thrashing at Bannockburn. Nothing but the absolute breaking down of the-nations and the destruction of all their policies, imperial or isolationist, will free those who are ready to give God the honor due to His name, and this He purposes to bring about in the destruction of Armageddon, when every evil thing will be destroyed, and those who seek Him will serve Him as He first purposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the domestic problems of England arises from the fact that there is a very considerable movement of industrial activity from the north of England to the London area. It is said that while employment in the north has increased of late by only 4 percent, in the London area it has increased by 40 percent. The heavy industries connected with cotton and wool cannot be transferred, of course, and the coal and iron are located in the north and the midlands and their connected industries must locate where they are. Lancashire has suffered greatly through the loss of its overseas trade: the foreign cotton markets are practically closed to its products. Changed conditions obtain. Japan is a strenuous competitor, and owing to the very low wages paid to the workers it can and does place its goods in the Far East at prices which are impossible to Lancashire. India also is producing for itself. Lancashire employs at present 500,000 fewer persons in the cotton industry than before the war. The present war preparation is giving some stimulus to the iron and connected works, but comparatively little, as the above-mentioned percentage shows. Lancashire once assumed that the demand for its goods would always expand, and its money men were as free to make machinery for the spinning and weaving of cotton and sell to India and Japan as others were to sell their manufactures. Now Lancashire is isolated. The past generation lived for their day, and ' the present suffers accordingly.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Hesitating Parsons</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The Church of England is not a close corporation like that of the Roman Catholic church as seen in its hierarchy, and there is a liberty of speech which Rome would never allow to anyone who has taken its orders.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Now and again an English church parson with more independence than his fellows ventures to criticize the bishops and the two archbishops. A “reverend” professor, master of Christ’s College, Cambridge, has spoken out about these heads of the English church because of their actions and words done and Spoken in favor of the Government's war policy at this time. He is reported as saying, “Archbishops have been trimming their sails to the winds of political expediency,” adding, “I would far rather see archbishops say frankly that Christianity is Utopian and cannot seriously be maintained as a practical ethic than sec them trimming their sails to political expediency and invoking Satan to cast out Satan . . . precisely what they have been doing in the past twelve months . . . each and all of the bishops have denounced the totalitarian State as Caesar-worship and blasphemy . . . yet today, when our own nation is mobilized on a totalitarian basis for a war as an instrument of national policy, we see our fathers-in-God falling in obediently behind the’ recruiting officers and repeating without a blush the slogans and militarisms of 1914.” Despite all their peace talk in recent years it was clear to all who know these ■ men that they would talk war when the Government’s call came. They trim their sails to catch popular support as well as political winds. The trouble with these parsons is in their refusal to acknowledge that their religious systems are no more Christian than this so-called Christian nation of England is Christian. Neither the nation as such nor any one of the church organizations has the right to the use of the word Christian; for the national affairs of the nation are conducted on pagan Jines, and the domestic legislation is conducted on what arc supposed to be business lines (or in party interests) and without any reference whatever to the teachings of Christ. All the nations are pagan no matter what form of government they assume or are given, and the fact that some of them support a religious church does not alter the case one bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is clear to those who are taught by the Lord through the Scriptures—as is now possible to all persons of good will towards God— that all these religious organizations called churches are alien to the teachings of Christ, being wholly contrary to Him and to His words. Jesus laid the foundation of His church in himself, and the active life of JTis church began at Pentecost. It was then composed of the poor and despised of the world, and so continues till the time of the establishment of His kingdom, which time is come. These religious organizations refuse to listen to the words of witness and wmrning by the faithful disciples of Christ, the witnesses of Jehovah, as the Jews of Jesus’ day refused to listen to Him. These great and powerful religious systems are intruders in the things of Christ, and naturally are enemies of the witness to the kingdom now set in Zion and on the way to its fullest establishment. The dissenting parsons who see the wrongness of the course of their bishops and archbishops, and the few among the non-conformist preachers who also dissent from the majority, should come out from these man-made systems and join in the witness which God is now causing to be given as His last words of warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">z &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Blasphemy and Begging</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• The Roman Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font7"> combines these in a begging appeal insertion with a bold heading, “Startling but True.” “Do you realize,” it says, “that Mary’s power with God is greater than that of all the Saints put together? Send petitions for your needs, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">six pence for a 24-hour candle, or three pence' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for a 10-hour candle to remind her of your needs, and pray that our debt of £9,000 may be reduced.” The Roman Catholic’s Mary must need a good deal of reminding of the needs of those whom she is supposed to care for! Here is another appeal published at the same time, this from a church which bears her name. “Money,” it says, “is desperately needed. ... Each day we beg Our Lady to help us.” Mary’s help is thought insufficient, for other “saints” are called in to help; and the appeal continues, “May they prompt you to send generous donation.” As these are only sampled ” of the nauseating begging advertisements of' the Catholic papers, so numerous and so constantly pressed, one wonders why reasoning persons do not refuse to be humbugged by the laudation of Mary and the “saints” they have made. The only way of getting deliverance from the confusion of the Roman church is by turning from it and from all religion; talcing the word of God and not the word of the Roman church as guide. No one needs to be in darkness about the Scriptures, now that the days are here when they are giving out all their light for the guidance of those who in this day of God’s judgment want to do the will of God and to seek truly to serve Him.</span></p>

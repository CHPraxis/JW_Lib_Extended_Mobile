<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Devil’s Real Objective</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">THE entire point of all that is occurring in Europe and elsewhere in the world is lost unless one sees the truth, which is that the Devil is frantic to stop the work of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Kingdom of God in the earth, the Theocracy. One must see the truth regarding Jehovah’s purposes, as that truth has been made known by the Father, through the Son, and as now proclaimed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society and the faithful men and women, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, in every part of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is nothing the Devil so much fears as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">truth.</span><span class="font12"> He has used religion to hide it, churchmen to misrepresent it, and governments to persecute it. He has done that in Germany since the advent of Hitler to power. To be sure, at the moment, some of Jehovah’s witnesses have been withdrawn from prisons and concentration camps to work on roads or perform other heavy labor in the present shortage of man-power in the Reich, but they arc hated none the less by the Devil, who seeks nothing short of their destruction. This can best be accomplished by the seizure of the entire world, and the placing of it under the control of the racket operating out of Vatican City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the way, of the 741 inhabitants of Vatican City 566 are Italians, 117 are Swiss, 31 were born on the premises, 11 are French, 11 are Germans, and there is 1 each from Belgium, Norway. Holland, Spain and Hungary. The Italians see to it that the care of this racket is kept closely in Italian hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">None should get the idea that Hitler knew nothing about Jehovah’s witnesses until he and his gang muscled in and seized control of Germany. In the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Wiener Neueste Nach-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 15. 1939 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">richten,</span><span class="font12"> October 24, 1938, Walter Vogel wrote of his experiences on June 17, 1922, sixteen years previous. He is reminiscing of Hitler, and what he knew of him eleven years before he took the reins of government from the faltering hands of old Air. Hindenburg. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was privileged to sit with Adolph Hitler, after the meeting in the Sophiensaal, in the caf'6 (Cafe Rebhubn). Afterwards I accompanied the Fuehrer to the Hotel Hamerand in the Sth district, Floriani-gasse; of course, we walked, and I told him of our struggle in Vienna, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of a broken-up meeting of the Bible Students</span><span class="font12"> and of other experiences during the time of struggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Light That Never Flickers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is good sometimes to read the opinions of men in far-off lands as to what is taking place in “Christendom”. Read, therefore, the kindly words of B. Stuart, published in the Natal (South Africa) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font12"> of July 15, 1939. Mr. Stuart is speaking of the terrible sufferings of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, and of the witness they have given to the honor of God’s name in a dark age, a dark land and a dark hour. He says to the editor of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Natal </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daibi News</span><span class="font12"> of Thursday you publish an item dated from Berlin giving news of a &quot;suppression without mercy” trial of several members of the “International Bible Searchers’ ” movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It might interest you to know that the correct English rendering of the name by which these German Christians are known is “The International Bible Students Association”, and that this association is the German branch of the world-wide “Watchtower” Bible and Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is not generally known that the “Bibelforsch-ers” constitute the sole obstacle within the old Reieh which Hitler has not been able to sweep from his path. Communists, Socialists, Left, Right and Center parties have vanished like morning mists before a summer sun. Organized religion is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">puppet of the State, and its ministers “heil” and goose-step with the fervency of conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STEADFAST</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But, like a light that never flickers, this little body of Christian men and women stand steadfast in their faith, a thorn in the side of the Monarch of Munich and a living testimony to his mortality. They have endured six years of the Hitlerian Hell. They have been killed. Two thousand of them have been consigned to a living death from which they have no hope in this world of returning. They have died at the triangle and on the rack of deliberate physical torture. Their tenacity and courage, and, above all, their sublime faith in the Bible and its author, have become proverbial throughout Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The reasons for their persecution are threefold: They refuse to Heil Hitler. They refuse to take up arms. They insist on preaching the good news of the approach of the Kingdom of Christ and its righteousness, before which the struttings of the war-lords become the crowing of a cockerel on a dung-heap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—&quot;sa </span><span class="font12">The conspiracy in Germany and r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout “Christendom” is a con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">spiraey against the King of kings </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">^r]\ 1 </span><span class="font12">and against the Word of God, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■u. </span><span class="font12">which liveth and abideth forever. It is because Jehovah’s witnesses are so faithful to both God and His Word that Hitler so hates them and has so abused them. Jehovah’s people, since the advent of this man to power, did what they could to encourage the people to turn to God and to His Word. Even this form of service was too much for Hitler and his “spiritual” guides, and they caused an order to be issued that Bibles may be placed on display only in religious book stores (get that word ‘‘religious’’), of which there are but few in Germany, and in all other book stores may be sold only when specifically ordered. See the terror of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">truth,</span><span class="font12"> how it strikes home to the heart of all tyrants. Hitler is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">afraid</span><span class="font12"> of the humble messengers of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The religionists welcome any king or any ruler except the Lord himself. In the Basle (Switzerland) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nazional Zeitung</span><span class="font12"> of April 1, 1937, their Berlin correspondent states the truth on this subject very well, though he certainly had no such intent:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One must not forget that the Protestant and the Catholic church have never opposed dictatorship as a form of government. On the contrary: must one be reminded that the Protestant clergy blessed swastika flags a long time before the seizure of power; that the Catholic church has never protested against the persecution of political opponents and against certain, now abolished, excesses of National Socialism, which were condemned in the whole world; that the pope and Mussolini agree well together and that the pope is supporting Franco financially and morally?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World-wide Opposition to witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Says H. E. Coffey, of Texas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then' is evidently a deliberate plan or conspiracy among leaders and religionists throughout the world not to recognize Jehovah’s witnesses as being Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World Outlook,</span><span class="font12"> a Methodist organ published at Nashville, Tenn., in its May (1939) number carries an editorial, “The Christian Church in a Hostile World,” which laments the spineless character of leaders and members of Protestant churches. In one paragraph is the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Uermuny at leasl one man—Pastor Nierrmeller— has preferred (lie concent rat ion camp to prostitution of mind and spirit. But it is alarming that there has been only one. Other Christians have no cause to be proud that they have escaped the rod of the unspeakable Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Can it be that this editor is ignorant of the fact that thousands of sincere Christians have been and are being persecuted in Germany?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hitler tells the world that there is “freedom of religion” in Germany. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonwealth,</span><span class="font12"> a monthly published at Osprey, Fla., by W. F. Burrows. M.D., gives an excerpt from the address of Adolph Hitler to the Reichstag on January 30, 1939, from which I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. . . Among the ou.ciies against Germany raised today in so-enlled (sic) democracies is the assertion that National-Socialist. Germany is an an'i-rcligious state. [Jehovah's witnesses, though, fully understand that it is religious.] I therefore wish to make the following solemn declaration to the whole German nation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;(1) No one in Germany has been persecuted for his religious views, nor will anyone be persecuted on that account!’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'‘But: The National Socialist State will ruthlessly make clear to I hose clergy who, instead of being God’s ministers, regard it as their mission to speak insultingly of our present Reich, its organization, or its leaders; that no one will tolerate (sic) a destruction of this state, and that clergy who place themselves beyond the pale of the law will be called to account before the law like any other German citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the same speech Hitler explains that “pederasty and sexual offenses against children” will be punished by the civil authorities, but he says: “It is no concern of ours if priests break their vows such as chastity.” Then he adds: “This State has only once interfered in the inner organization of the churches. This happened in 1933, when I myself attempted to unite the hopelessly disrupted Protestant Regional Churches in Germany into one large and powerful Evangelical Reich Church. The attempt failed owing to the opposition of some of the Regional bishops. In consequence, no further</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">efforts were made; after all, it is not our task to defend the Protestant Church or even to strengthen it by forceful means.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Indeed, Hitler’s entire plan is to strengthen only the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. Another article in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonwealth,</span><span class="font12"> “The Church in the New Germany,” a reprint from “News from Germany”, shows how this is being done. Every encouragement is being given that organization, and a marked growth in membership and influence of the Catholic Church in Germany is the result. The German Government now taxes the people to support the churches. Hitler claims this is entirely a voluntary arrangement. He tells the people that at any time that the churches (he doubtless refers to the Catholic Church) request it, he is willing to do away with this arrangement and separate the churches from any connection with the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Skillfully disguised, propaganda is now being circulated and published in magazines and the press of America to bring American people around to the Nazi viewpoint. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World Affairs </span><span class="font12">for June, a quarterly published by the American Peace Society in Washington, D.C., has an editorial by its editor, Arthur Decrin Call, which is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">caveat</span><span class="font12"> to the thoughtful observers of world affairs. This pronouncement, “In Behalf of Good Will,” circulated under the auspices of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and drafted by Professor A. II. Compton of the University of Chicago, Carlton Hays of Columbia University, and Roger W. Strauss, is an appeal to Americans to oppose all who are anti-Catholic, anti-Jew, anti-Communist, anti-Nazi, etc. In simple words, this declaration means that no one should think or speak against the fundamental teachings or the activities of any of the enemies of Jehovah God who are running amuek in the world today. The effect would be to keep the people in :gnorance and allow these foul institutions to spread and, finally, enslave the people. Under the guise of good will and noble ethical intentions, the pronouncement is a leader to put the people in an attitude and .frame of mind which will cause them to submit in the, course of events to enslavement. A onesided liberty is no liberty at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Even to Shedding of Blood”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The statement of the “Most Reverend” J. 0. McGuigan to Enrico Cardinal Gaspar ri, at Midland, Ontario—</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Come what may, we will preserve</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">the faith, even to the shedding of blood, for our children and our children’s children — may have been a reference to the act of fellow Catholics firing on Jehovah’s witnesses at St. . Laurent, on the island of Orleans, Wednesday, June 28, forty days previous. This willingness to preserve one’s own “faith” by murdering somebody else is an act of religion that Gasparri ought to know about. Of course, it is contrary to everything in the Bible, but neither McGuigan nor Gasparri accepts the Bible as authority for human conduct. They accept the teachings of the “Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The only liberty in Quebec is the liberty to pay money to lying priests for misinformation about a place that does not exist— “P u r g a t o r </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">y”</span><span class="font12"> The Montreal </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Standard </span><span class="font12">has a column and a half about, the trip of the Kingdom II down the St, Lawrence river, from Montreal. Residents of the island of Orleans fired on the vestel. At LTsIet the witnesses were forbidden to land. Other reports follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Three reports covering the voyage of Witnesses, which read like a log of the fruitless journey of the “Kingdom II”, would imply that the evangelists were having just as difficult a trip as did the first missionaries who sailed up the same broad river several centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These reports were wired to the British United Press by correspondents down the river. The first dated June 14, from Quebec, reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Three members of Jehovah’s witnesses traveling on the schooner “Kingdom 11” tried vainly to disembark al Quebec today. Police seized 50 records </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span class="font11">a phonograph which was placed on the-bank of the St.'Charles river.

This morning they found the records and the phonograph, which were to be used for propaganda, on the bank of the St. Charles river, and seized them. No arrests wore made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In answer to a query from the British United Press as to where the Witnesses came from and on what grounds police were refusing them permission to land the following reply was wired from Quebec the same day, June 14:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Party from Montreal. They were refused permission to land at Sorel last Friday and also at Three Rivers. They then stopped in the middle of the river at .Deschaillons, some twenty miles above Quebec, and arrived here yesterday afternoon. Police have no specific charge against them. They just seized the records and phonograph as pernicious literature and if the three men disembark they will be arrested and charged with creating a disorder. This afternoon the party is moving to Beauport and Provincial Police will also prevent them from disembarking there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The third message, dated June 29, tells how the Witnesses were received with rifle shots at St. Laurent on the island of Orleans and how they were refused permission to land at L'lslet. It adds they were continuing their troubled but determined way down the river.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The Seventh World-Power (Britain and America) must come to the disgrace of being swallowed up by the Totalitarian Monstrosity. Both nations deserve it well. The details have been published over and over again—the trips to Rome, the kneeling before the pope,* the sending of secret messages and private ambassadors, and the ignoring of the cry of Jehovah’s witnesses for justice in “the land of the free and the home of the brave”. In the ' face of 2,000 eases of imprisonment of Jehovah’s witnesses for telling the truth of God’s Word, the president-of the United States not only kowtows to the pope but sends messages of congratulation to bis representatives, and tells them to 'go to it; what the nation needs is more religion’. They threaten to murder anybody that disagrees with them, and yet, when a pope dies, the entire Congress of the United States, elected by the people, and paid handsomely for its services, wastes an entire day to grieve over the 'untimely’ death, at 81 years of age, of one of the most unprincipled murderers that ever Jived. [* See pp. 16-17.] United States Senator William E. Borah does not seem to think that either Uncle Sam or John Bull is entitled to much sympathy for what is certainly coming to them. He is on record as saying publicly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What is the difference between the dictators and the democracies in Europe when questions touching international affairs are being considered; however it would, how could the United States distinguish in foreign affairs between the dictators and so-called democracies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For illustration, what was the difference in policy between the dictators and democracies at Munich! Wherein did they differ in their foreign policy or principle! And we are not concerned with their internal policy, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the hour came for the dictators and the democracies to join in an international movement of stupendous moment, that is, to destroy, to literally murder, the one real democracy in Europe, what was the distinction in the principles applied by the dictators and the democracies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. When it appeared to be in the interest of the dictators and the democracies to break treaties, to disregard all law, Itegal, moral or divine, all principles supposed to obtain among honorable and decent communities, what was the distinction!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In what respect did they differ! Did the dictators and the democracies disagree as to the fact they were willing to destroy a helpless nation f</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Did they disagree as to how it was to Ijp done! Was there anything considered, by all or any of them, except purely selfish interests, brutal, criminal, selfish interests!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Did not tbe democracies, even at the suggestion of the dictators, go at midnight and serve notice on the president of the Republic of Czechoslovakia that the time had come for the dismemberment of this republic—a nation denied a hearing, denied the slightest opportunity for defense, to offer up its very existence and to do so in haste, as one of the messenger democracies had other matters which required its attention shortly!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Britain, now involved in another great war, has had due notice of God’s purposes. On July 7, 1939, J.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">On Sunday May 21, Catholic Action in the Ebbw Valley in South Wales, under the leadership of one “Rev. Father” George McDonagh, thought they scored a victory by forcing the superintendent of the “Celynen Ambulance Hall” to break his word and cancel the public meeting scheduled there by Jehovah’s witnesses. This whole affair was a highhanded dictatorial undertaking complete with threats of Catholic boycott in the typical Hierarchy manner. Having been denied the privilege of having their Bible meeting in the Newbridge hall Jehovah’s witnesses began to visit other halls in this town, and every one of them refused because of Catholic pressure. Not to be outdone, efforts were made to engage a hall in several of the other mining towns in this Ebbw Valley adjoining to Newbridge. Finally they succeeded in contracting for the Empire Cinema in Crumlin. The meeting was to be held on Sunday June 11, where Judge Rutherford’s famous anti-Fascist lecture was to be given for the benefit of the people. The manager of this theater was very agreeable. It was suggested to him that there would be a possibility of some Catholics’ putting pressure on him, and he replied, “I’ve no time for the Catholics. I know a lot about them and no one will influence me against this meeting. I rent you the theater for £3, and it’s immaterial what you say in the meeting. If you can get the consent of the Monmouthshire County Council to hold it, it’s O.K. with me. My word is my bond.” With this agreement and the proper application to the Monmouthshire County Council, permission was granted Jehovah’s witnesses to have this cinema opened for the Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On Tuesday June 6, six days before the lecture, A. Whit Aker, the manager of the Cinema, in excited rage informed representatives of Jehovah’s witnesses that he was breaking the contract. Catholic Action had paid him a visit and had spoken. He was in a fearful condition and refused to discuss the matter. He was giving in to the Catholics even though he himself was not a Catholic, saying that he had his home life to look after and also that his living was involved. He succumbed to Catholic pressure in spite of his previous boast of fairness and tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This flagrant violation of covenant'was immediately placed in the hands of the Society’s London solicitors for quick legal action. The solicitors gave him until June the 8th to change his mind, but he still refused. Thus it has become necessary to take legal steps against Mr. Whitaker for breach of contract, which may make him regret his bowing to the “old lady”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s witnesses were already undertaking the advertising of this important meeting when this frustration occurred. Not to be outdone by these Cat ho lie-Fascists, arrangements were made for all Jehovah’s witnesses from the neighboring companies in this Ebbw Valley to join together in a special attack on Crumlin on Saturday and Sunday of the scheduled meeting. Large placards in their “information marches” informed the people of the underhanded efforts of the Hierarchy in canceling this meeting. Announcement was made that this lecture would be held in the open air near to the Empire Cinema so that all the people could hear this important lecture which the Catholics were afraid of. The whole population in Crumlin and the neighboring small mining towns was thoroughly aroused. Eight hundred Welsh people turned out Sunday night and it took three soundcars to pump “Fascism or Freedom” out to these hungering people. The original theater could have seated only 200, but, with Catholic Action effectively assisting in advertising the issue, the tables were turned on them, and the people were told the truth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Assault at Blantyre, Scotland</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ On Sunday April 23, pioneer Albert Bacon was witnessing to the people in miners’ row of houses in Stonefield Rd., Blantyre, and was accompanied by a young boy six years of age. The people were very courteous and appreciated our calling on them with the Kingdom message, They accepted the invitation to hear the reproduction of Judge Rutherford’s lecture “Fascism or Freedom”, which was being widely advertised in the<sup>:</sup> neighborhood of Blantyre. When Albert reached house No. 51 on Stonefield Rd., the following happened, and is described in his own words:'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“When the incident happened I was stand</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ee N SOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ing in the doorway inviting the gentleman of the house to come to hear the lecture, which invitation he accepted. At this precise moment I noticed from the corner of my eye a man coming across the road from the new housing scheme (I had not seen this man before). lie stood at the door for about a minute; I thought it was his intention to go into the house; my back was turned on the man (Thomas Murphy, of 43 Stonefield Rd.). However, he grabbed me by the back of my coat and pulled me out from the doorway, and in his so doing I knocked the young boy down. His words were to the effect that I must stop the work which Jehovah commands must be done. The Bible literature which was in my hands was knocked away, and it was his intention to punch or do bodily injury to me, and in preventing him from so doing I was justified. His wife came out and coaxed him away with almost unsuccessful tactics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The names and addresses of five witnesses were quickly taken and the matter was reported to the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On May 11 Thomas Murphy’s case came up for trial, and with the abundance of evidence he was quickly found guilty and fined 15/-. This will certainly teach zealous followers of Catholic priests to think twice before committing assault against Jehovah’s witnesses in the Blantyre district.</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19391115_files/g_E_19391115-10.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">In view of the continued opposition from the Catholic Hierarchy in the forms of assaults, mob violence, and breaking up of public meetings, Judge Rutherford’s advice has been sought. Following is his advice, which has just been received from Brooklyn, on the matter of Catholic violence: (Quote)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We should expect these things now, because the truth is stirring up the Devil’s crowd, and the witnesses should be encouraged to go straight forward in the work without hesitancy, knowing that it, is the time when the testimony must be given find, when given, will Certainly stir up strife on the part of the enemy. My advice is that when you are going into a community where you expect trouble you first notify the police officers that you are coining and request that they have an officer near by to witness any attempted assaults and make arrests of the persons who do attempt to assault. The person who gives the witness might carry a strong walking stick and another publisher walk near him, he also carrying a strong walking stick. If any attempt is made to interfere, let one of them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 15, 1939 </span><span class="font12">say to the disturbers: “Stand back; if you assault this man, who has done nothing to you, I will takifr a hand and use this cane to good advantage, and I will not hesitate to use it under such circumstances.” The idea that wc have to stand mute, and refuse to protect ourselves when assaulted by a wrongdoer, is entirely un-Scriptural. If the police want to do their duty they will have somebody present and break up these mobs. Otherwise mark some in such a way that they can be identified. Get the witnesses and take them into court and have a test case and determine whether or not there is any further freedom in Britain to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thus Judge Rutherford has plainly set forth our right as Christians to defend ourselves and the Kingdom interests against attacks from Jehovah’s enemies. See Exodus 22:2,3. Note the action Jesus took to safeguard the Kingdom interests, at John 2:15, Matthew 21 :12,13, and Mark 11:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On May 20 the zone servant for Glasgow and three other publishers were served with a complaint by the police wherein they were charged by two priests of Clydebank with having ‘caused a crowd of people to collect and did commit a breach of the peace on the Sunday of March 5’, This interesting ease came to trial on Wednesday June 7. The Society engaged a well-known lawyer in Glasgow to make the defense. On the same day the trial of Patrick McCrory, leader of a mob against Jehovah’s people on February 5, came before the judge for hearing. Enclosed find a brief report from the zone servant on these two trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This afternoon, after a trial lasting two hours, witnesses Bacon, Brown, Whiteford and myself were found “not guilty” by Judge Burns on the charge of disturbing the peace brought against us by the priests McEwan and Duffin of Clydebank. T wo priests appeared in court, one of which was the “Rev. Father” Dr. McEwan. Our solicitor endeavored to pave the way for us to give witness to our message, but the judge immediately stopped this, saying the charge involved an annoyance by sound. However, little bits came out which were in themselves a witness. It was interesting and almost comical when our solicitor in cross-examining Dr. McEwan produced the Catholic Bellarmine Society’s report titled “Judge Rutherford and the Witnesses of Jehovah” and asked the said “rev.” gentleman to read aloud the last paragraph,<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark37">1</a></sup> where it gives advice as to how- to treat Jehovah’s witnesses to ‘prevent them from becoming a nuisance’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Poor old priest! You should have seen his face while reeding- that last paragraph. Out of his own mouth he was condemned. Our witnesses, in comparison with the Catholic witnesses, gave a good account of themselves; none contradicted the other. The priests had poor witnesses for their side, and once the prosecutor said to a Catholic witness, “'Is that what you were told to say’/’-' At another point the police sergeant made a statement and this was contradicted immediately after by his superior, the inspector. The prosecutor pounced on this and made much of the point. Thus after two hours the judge found us not guilty. The court was crowded out, principally by Jehovah’s witnesses; and what a showing! One hundred and twenty publishers attended. Then- the second case came up, when MeGrory was brought forward, found guilty of assailing Jehovah’s servants, and fined 30/- or 10 days in jail. And so the battle we have been fighting for the last five months came to an end with a victory which the Lord has given ua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All the British witnesses rejoice with the Glasgow publishers in these preliminary victories over Jehovah’s enemies and pray the Lord will strengthen them to keep pressing forward the Kingdom fight.—Rescript of information to Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers of Britain, issued from London office of Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic-Fascist Menace in Britain </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fosters Violence—Denies Freedom of Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ At the start let this fact be clearly borne in mind: that this is not a cry for Jehovah’s witnesses, who have been the object of Catholic-Fascist violence and reproach during the past several months. Jehovah’s witnesses are neither Communists nor members of any political movement, but are wholly and uncompromisingly for Jehovah God’s kingdom. under Christ and, as such, are faithful Christians. If they die in the performance of duty Jehovah will preserve their eternal existence. Whether one lives or dies is relatively unimportant, because the Devil’s agents can only kill the body but are unable to destroy ■ the right to life. (Luke 12:4) Jehovah’s witnesses trust in the Lord and need nothirfg from any man. But the purpose here is to warn the people of good will that if they continue to uphold and support an organization that is fighting against God’s kingdom they will suffer the consequences of its destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">PUBIJC WARNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On September 11, 1938, at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Judge Rutherford, spokesman for Jehovah’s witnesses, sounded a timely warning, Which message was transmitted by wireless to the English-speaking people throughout the earth. In brief that warning was this: Vatican City, directing its Hierarchy throughout the world and acting in conjunction with Fascists and Nazis, is in a conspiracy to grab control of and rule the world, regiment the people, and dictate arbitrarily to all. In recent months the development of the physical facts in Britain have shown not only that the warning was timely, but that the predicted events are coming to pass much quicker than many anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CATHOLIC HIERARCHY SECRETLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ADMITS FASCIST ALLIANCE '</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During recent months the Catholic Press and other-Catholic agencies have secretly admitted their close association with Fascist interests and their move for power in Britain. But The Bellarmine Society (Catholic), Hey-throp College, in April, 1939, published a lengthy work entitled “Judge Rutherford and the Witnesses of Jehovah”, where they privately make the following significant statement: “Many non-Catholies would agree with Rutherford on a number of points, and eVen some Catholics who have succumbed to Leftwing propaganda will agree that he (Judge Rutherford) is not far wrong in saying that the Church is in alliance with Fascism. Criticisms of Rutherford, therefore, have to be so expressed that no handle is given to Communists, etc. For Communists would be quite ready to ignore, for the moment, the fact that Rutherford regards Communism itself as a child of the Devil, However, if these difficulties are kept well in mind, good work can be done by showing up Rutherford’s fundamental opposition to religion and to constituted authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, Jehovah’s witnesses openly admit their opposition to hypocritical practices of religion which are out of harmony with God’s Word, the Bible, but they deny that they are in opposition to the constituted authority of any state. Definitely they are not Communists. But does not the above statement plainly show that members of the Catholic Hierarchy are the ones who are in opposition to constituted authority by admitting they are in alliance with Fascism and thus against demoeraeyl</span></p>

Furthermore, through a reformed upper house, British Fascism invites the official co-operation of the Catholic Church to the end that the government may have guidance in this very matter.” Also we quote from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald </span><span class="font12">of May 12, 1939, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">“Action!

<p><span class="font12">April 30, 1939, Folkestone.—A party of forty members of Catholic Action came to the public meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses at the Town Hall and raised such a commotion that order was not restored until the police arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">May 7,1939, Hebburn-on-Tyne.—The local priest, “Father” Witty, brought pressure to bear and had the local public hall canceled to Jehovah’s witnesses a few hours before their advertised Bible meeting was to have started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">May 19,1939, Glasgow.—A party of twelve of Jehovah’s witnesses were seriously harassed and some injured in one of the largest of mobs gathered in the Garn gad Road district. It is estimated about two thousand Catholics participated in this demonstration of mass violence and assault. Eight of the mob were charged by the police and seven were finally brought before the magistrate and found guilty and punished for their violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">May 21, 1939, Newbridge, Mon.—“Father” McDonagh openly threatened to boycott the management of the “Celynen Ambulance Hall” in respect to an agreement made to let the hall to Jehovah’s witnesses for their public Bible lecture. A few hours before the scheduled meeting the management weakly gave in to the threat and refused to allow' Jehovah’s witnesses to exercise their right of freedom of assembly. [See page 8.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">June 11, 1939, Crumlin, Mon.—This same “Father” McDonagh succeeded in having the management of the Empire Cinema, Crumlin, break his contract to allow a public Bible meeting, even though the local Watch Committee had already given its sanction. This second breach of contract is now the subject of action in the local court. “Father” McDonagh has evidently succeeded in setting up a censorship over that entire Welsh valley. By intimidation and boycott he has forced all other’ owners and managers of halls and cinemas in that section to refuse Jehovah’s witnesses to exercise their right of freedom of assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the past few weeks many other incidents of the same character have occurred in Dundee, North wich, Stirling, Leicester, Thor-naby, and Camberiey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It must be said that much of this opposition has been as a result of Judge Rutherford’s famous anti-Faseist lecture “Fascism or Freedom”, which presents the bare facts and arguments the Catholic-Fascists have been unable to successfully refute. Instead of openly<sup>1</sup> discussing this matter as gentlemen, they resort to force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All this time the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font12"> principal organs of the Catholic Press in Britain, have been carrying on a bitter attack, and Jehovah’s witnesses have no doubt that such articles have encouraged further violence. For example, in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Universe </span><span class="font12">of June 16, on page 10, the writer tells a brief storj' of how in Belfast one who Shouts “To hell with the pope” finds himself in the hospital within exactly ten minutes. Then he goes on to say that “Jehovah’s witnesses may not have used these precise words, but their language has been quite as provocative”. To many this might appear in a subtle manner as inciting to violence and maltreatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SHALL CATHOLIC-FASCIST ROME RULE BRITAIN?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The facts above are plainly stated, that all order-loving people of Great Britain who believe that the British people, and not Rome, should rule this country may know what is behind the scenes. The Catholic clergy and leaders pretending to be Christians are in fact religionists engaged in a subtle political campaign to control not only Germany, Italy and Spain and other countries of the Continent, but Great Britain and America. They and all their tactics are against true freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Fascist-Catholic Hierarchy must know that this is the land of Britain, and not Rome; that they may freely practice their religion here amongst those who like it; but that they cannot use their religious institution as a political machine to turn over to the fanatical dictators the liberties of the British people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bible prophecies clearly foretold these days, with violence on every hand within and without the nations. These are the last days, when Satan’s entire organization of world control is being maneuvered against God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, which is now being established. Jehovah’s witnesses now encourage you to get a quick knowledge of God’s kingdom, so that you may find a place of safety and protection before the battle of Armageddon begins. Many honest Catholics in this land and abroad, seeing the obvious Fascist course of their Catholic clergy and leaders, are how turning away from that religib-political institution in shame and disgust. All people who believe in Almighty God and His Word should promptly forsake that wicked organization and have nothing more to do with it..</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">FREE GOLDEN AGE</span><span class="font12"> No. 467, August 11, </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">/</span><span class="font12"> 1937, told of the doings of Chief of Police J. E. Matthews, and his fellow anarchists, at La Grange, Georgia: how 76 prisoners were illegally transferred from the city to the county stockade; how the transport was illegally made at the speed of 65 miles an hour; how an innocent man was arrested and fined for doing the very thing he had been given a permit to do; how the chief plainly showed contempt of court; how he refused to arrest a fellow anarchist on a charge of assault and battery, and how he stated that if Jehovah’s witnesses ever came to La Grange again he would leave town after turning them over to a mob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chief Matthews’ word is no better than his official conduct. He stated the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses borders on the rankest kind of Communism, and, when offered $25 to produce one single legal proof of that statement, hung his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chief Matthew's’ treatment of prisoners entitles him to be put in the same class with Hitler’s Gestapo. He put 56 men to sleep in a place where mattresses were so elose to the cowpen that urine splashed on their mattresses and on the men lying on them; the drainage from this eowpen passed down a ditch between the mattresses, not more than three feet away on either side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">For further particulars see the above issue, a copy of which was put in every home in La Grange, and see the five biting cartoons that tell the story better than words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some of the La Grange officials learned something from the distribution of that magazine. One of them lost his job because of it, and all of them should have done so, including that blemish on the landscape who still pretends to be an officer of the law, whose injury is mentioned in the accompanying reproduction from the Atlanta </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font12"> of O tober 13, 1939. It is interesting and significant that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 1B, 1839 </span><span class="font12">next item in the same paper narrates a court decision in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is a story in 2 Kings 1:1-17 which Chief Matthews eould read with profit. King Ahaziah had met with an accident. He wanted to get well; but one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the prophet Elijah, sent word to him that he would die, and he did. Chief Matthews has been paying too much attention to the clergy, as did Ahaziah. The clergy of La Grange are a sad lot. They know nothing about the Word of God or about Christianity. When Jehovah’s witnesses were abused in their eity, not one of them lifted his voice in protest against all the lawlessness of Matthews and his brother anarchists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Here is a sample of how much the La Grange clergy know. On Sunday, September 3, 1939, the “Reverend Doctor” Willis E. Howard, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Matthews’ eity is alleged to have said that “God is doing all that man will let him do” and “God doesn’t have a chance until he can find his own people”. What kind of god is that ? The answer is that that god is the Devil. It certainly is not the God of the Bible, Jehovah; for Jehovah says of himself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand . , . This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is<sub>:</sub> stretched out upon all the nations. For [Jehovah] of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it V and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?—Isaiah 14:24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Matthews has been trying to curry favor by flirting with the false god, the Devil. In so doing he has been sinning against his own soul. The only chance he has, or that anybody has, is to get over on the side of the true God, the God of the Bible, Jehovah, the Creator. He may recover, and he may </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">not.</span><span class="font12"> Armageddon will settle Chief Matthews’ account, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">anyway.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Negro Woman Worker</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font12">HOUGH women in general have been discriminated against and exploited through limitation of their opportunities for employment,. through long hours, low wages, and harmful working conditions, such hardships have fallen upon Negro women with double harshness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a study of laundries by the Women’s Bureau in 1935, Bureau agents were told again and again that commercial laundries, especially in the South, were having a terrific struggle to compete with Negro washwomen. The following comments made by laundry employers, employment office officials, and other informed persons illustrate conditions then:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the depression, servants are required to do laundry as well as maid work; most of them get only $3 a week on the average. Greatest competition is colored washwomen. Will take a 30-pound bundle for a dollar. Some of them do a week’s washing for 50 cents. The washwoman charges only 60 to 75 percent of what the laundry charges for the same size bundle. The manager knew of a number of washwomen who were glad to get a day’s work for earfare, lunch, and an old dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Long as may be the hours of the Negro domestic worker, low as may be her earnings and those of the Negro woman in laundry, hotel, or restaurant, in general the economic status of these workers is much more favorable than that of the Negro woman agricultural laborer. One of these testified as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And clothing isn’t in it. Since they stopped using fertilizer the clothes are very scanty, because we could take fertilizer sacks and make aprons and dresses for the little children. But since they are not using fertilizer very much you just can’t hide their nakedness through the winter. Sometimes you find in some of the houses that the little children are barefooted, and the children in some of the houses couldn’t go to school in the winter because they did not have clothes to go in. And some of them haven’t even got houses to stay in as good as lots of common barns. And some families of 12 or 14 live in houses with maybe one room and kitchen, with maybe three beds where 10 or 12 are sleeping in the three beds, and the kitehen is so open that you can just pass by and look through and see them all sitting in there, and not even have a flue for the stove pipe to go in, and the stove is setting oat in the floor. And maybe they have two joints of a stove-pipe, and maybe one piece of elbow, and when you start a fire you will get smoke all over the house until it gets started burning good, and you have to stay outside until it starts burning good because it smokes you out. Families have to put up with all kinds of things like that.</span></p>

You would have to laugh to see how the newspapers dodged this reason- ‘ able explanation. His “physician” was reported to have said that “it was possible the shook of the accident had corrected whatever condition caused the blindness”. The physician was dead right, and it was too bad he did not know something about it in the first place, or that some chiropractor did not get the case, so that the young man could have had the gift of vision during the three weeks in which, instead, he was blind.

<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">W</span><span class="font12">ITHIN many nations of the earth Jews are cruelly persecuted. Is there any good reason why any person should be persecuted merely because that person is a Jew? There is no just cause or excuse to persecute anyone. There is no reason or just excuse for the persecution of the Jews. Jehovah God is the Creator of the earth and He put man upon the earth. It is authoritatively written in His Word that “God . . . hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to divell on all the face of the earth”. (Acts 17:261 Furthermore Jehovah says: “I have made the earth, and created man upon it; I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.’’— Isaiah 45:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Jews are the descendants of Jacob, a grandson of Abraham. Jacob’s name was changed by the Lord to Israel, and with the Israelites God made a covenant, thereby agreeing to give them special blessings if they would be obedient to Him. One of Israel’s sons was named Judah, which name means “praised”, and true Judeans are those who praise the Almighty God. The promise was given that from the tribe of Judah should come the Messiah, who should rule the world in righteousness and who in the Scriptures is designated ‘The Thon [mighty One] of the tribe of Judah; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.’ (Genesis 49:10; Revelation 5:5) God made the law covenant with the Jews for their oto protection until the coming of the Messiah. (Galatians 3 : 24) In due time Jesus came to the nation of the Jews, or Israelites, to teach them the truth, and God anointed Him the Messiah. The common people amongst the Jews believed Jesus, and received Him gladly; but their religious leaders rejected and persecuted Jesus.—Mark 12:37; 8:31; Luke 7:30.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19391115_files/g_E_19391115-14.png" alt="" style="width:448pt;height:98pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The persecutors of Jesus were leaders of religion, that is, the Pharisees, doctors of the law, who taught the Jewish people. Jehovah God had caused IHs prophet to foretell that such persecution would come upon Jesus by that class of persons. (Isaiah 53:1-12). This fact explains the cause for the persecution of the Jews, and from what follows it will be seen that all persecution is induced by the Devil. The Almighty God gave Jerusalem to the Jews and put His name there, and therefore Jerusalem stood for the-name of Jehovah God. Long before that the Devil had declared that he could cause all men to curse God to His face. (Job 2:5) To accomplish his wicked purpose the Devil employed religion, that is, he induced the people to give adoration, praise and worship to demons and creatures and idols, and this he did in order to turn them away from Jehovah: God warned the Israelites that religion would be a snare that would bring them into great trouble and that hence they must worship Him alone and have nothing to do with idols or demons or any kind of religion. (Deuteronomy 7:1-16; Exodus 20:1-5) The leaders of the Israelites, called “Pharisees” and “doctors”, indulged in the practice of religion, and instead of teaching the people the Word of God they taught them the traditions of men. By this means the people were brought into the snare of the Devil. Jesus told the Pharisees that by their religious teachings and practices they had made the Word of God of -none effect. Directing His words to the religious leaders He said: “Ye hypocrites I well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh' unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matthew 15:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From that time forward the Pharisees cruelly persecuted Jesus and His disciples, and to the Pharisees or religious leaders Jesus said: ‘Ye seek to kill me because I have told you the truth. . , . Why do ye not under-stand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.’— John 8:40-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All the scriptures bearing on the point show that the Devil induced the persecution of Jesus and-also those who have followed Him, and which he did in order to turn them away from God. The nation of Israel, or Jews, is the only nation upon whom God ever bestowed His name; therefore the name Jews, or Israelites, is connected with the name of Jehovah God and all who are in any wise connected with Jehovah’s name are objects of persecution by the Devil and his agents. The Devil hates everyone whom God recognizes or favors. The religious leaders turned the nation against God, and for that reason the nation was cast away; and the Devil has ever since ’» taken advantage of this to heap trouble upon the Jews, and make it appear that Jehovah God cannot protect His own with whom He made a covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the year 1914 the woes upon the peoples of the earth have greatly increased; and the reason is this, to wit: In that year Christ Jesus, the Messiah, was enthroned and sent forth to rule the world, while Satan was still in power, exercising his wicked power over - the nations. There quickly followed a war in heaven between the Devil and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Devil and his angels Were cast down to the earth. (Revelation 12:1-9) The Devil knowing that his time is short until the final'battle at Armageddon, he has ever since attempted to turn all men against God and Christ in order to bring about the destruction of the people. He therefore increases the persecution upon all persons who are in any wise connected with the name of Jehovah. While it is true that the Jews as a nation have been east away, yet the Devil, by causing their persecution, expects to induce the people to believe that God cannot hold to himself those with whom he made a covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The persecution of Christians has greatly increased since the World War because they are the servants of Jehovah God. In Germany Hitler hates the name of Jehovah, and he and his followers, acting by the spirit of the Devil, have persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jews who once bore the name of Jehovah. This is clearly in fulfillment of the scripture, which reads: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” —Revelation 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Christians are those who love Jehovah God, and who follow the lead of Christ Jesus in serving God and in doing good to others. Christians never persecute anyone. All persecution is prompted by the Devil. Those who are controlled by the spirit of the Devil indulge in persecuting others who try to do right, and the Devil’s purpose is always to reproach the name of Almighty God. Those persons who practice religion and lead in religious matters indulge in the persecution of others; and this is further proof that religion is the product of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Jews suffer cruel persecution at the hands of those who practice religion of one kind or another. For instance, Hitler has his peculiar religion, which is clearly the product of the Devil. Christians in Germany and elsewhere in the earth suffer persecution at the hands of religionists because Christians serve God and publish His name and His kingdom. All persons who desire righteousness refuse to indulge in the persecution of others, regardless of what others may believe. While it is true that the Jews are not Christians, yet</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">because that nation and people once bore the name of Jehovah God, even though they were cast away as a nation, they are still the objects of tlie Devil’s hatred and he induces their persecution as a further reproach to the name of the Almighty God. No doubt many Jews do wrong, but that is no reason or excuse for their persecution. The present generation of Jews are in no wise responsible for what the Pharisees and others did nineteen centuries ago. Because of their name the Devil hates them and causes their cruel persecution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ In putting on double blankets start with a single edge at the top or head of the bed; spread it down to the foot; tuck the double edge under the mattress, so it will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">stay</span><span class="font12"> tucked, and bring the other single edge again toward the head of the bed as far as it may go. A correspondent says this is very important, so as to prevent the persecution of little children and others; and he is right. Nobody is helped by excess coverings. The feet should be kept covered ; the upper part of the body needs less heat; during the night, as the bodily temperature sinks, it sometimes feels good to draw up an extra cover from the foot of the bed, but if the body is warm to the hips it is usually comfortable all over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ Two dominies gained fame for themselves at High Point, N.C., in connection with an information mar eh field there by 107 of Jehovah’s witnesses. The march itself was a. grand witness for the Lord, The marchers, fifteen feet apart, made a line four blocks long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">'Tie ver end” Hugh Jones was displeased. Seeing the marchers he loudly addressed those about him, saying, among other things:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Look at those preachers there. They are dressed like they came out of a bandbox, clean on the outside but dirtier than hell on the inside. Look at that sign, “Religion is a snare and a racket.” That is a damned lie. Do you want me to spit on that? [This to a woman who held out the booklet Fascism </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">or Freedom.]</span><span class="font12"> I’ll throw this rock through you. [This to a man in the line.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">His language became so foul that the police gathered him in, booked him on a charge of disorderly conduct, and he was taken to jail, The next day he was found guilty of the charge and was ordered to leave the city for a period of not less than five years. He was definitely found guilty of boisterous cursing and swearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Reverend” G. W. Cooper, 609 Commonwealth Ave., also learned something. This is very hard for a “Reverend”; ordinarily they never learn anything at all. As the marchers went about their business in an orderly manner the “Reverend” drove slowly along yelling to mothers in the line with their children, “You mothers with your children: fine mothers you are. You are not fit to raise dogs, much less children.” To the men he shouted, “You are a bunch of grand rascals headed straight for hell.” To everyone he explained that he had a tent at Greensboro (fifteen miles away) and those who could should be there that night and he would explain how Judge Rutherford “has been getting away with his mess”, and that “there at the tent I will let God have his way”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Several of the men among the witnesses went down to see about it. Just as they arrived a peculiar windstorm attacked the tent and tore it into ribbons. Recognizing some of the witnesses, “Reverend” Cooper stated, “We will beat those people if we have to do it with our fists.” Thereupon Jehovah’s witnesses had him arrested for disorderly conduct. He was given a suspended sentence, but told he must not do anything of the sort again or it would go hard with him. To raise the court costs, which were levied against him, he had to beg the money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ We have been pioneering in and around Grenoble for some time now and are beginning to enjoy some of the fruits of our labors: a few people of good will are beginning to see the issue and are taking their stand. One of them handed us a local parish magazine recently which showed us that someone in the local blasphemy and lie factory was finding this fruit rather sour, so, to take the taste away, he delivered himself of the following’ in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin P&amp;roixsine de St. Louis de Grenoble</span><span class="font12"> for the month of April:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Take Notice: La </span><span class="font12">Tour.de Garde and the Works of Judge Rutherford. La Tour de Garde and Bible Students’ Society is offering from house to house numerous booklets, such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy, Face the Facts, Consolation.</span><span class="font12"> This sect, maliciously anti-Cathofie, is dealt with by Father Vincent de Moor, in his book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Leur Combat</span><span class="font12"> [Their Fight], who analyzes, on pages 141-157, the Watchtower (Tour de Garde) movement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">(1) The Watchtower is a subversive movement. It condemns all existing authority, economic,, practical and religious. The movement does not pretend to organize revolution. It contents itself with announcing it, and attaching itself to the way ,of Jehovah, who henceforth leads the great fight. The pacific statements of the Watchtower people do not hinder them from engaging </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font12"> every struggle supposedly for Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(2) The Watchtower draws all its doctrines from the Bible. Therein lies a close affinity with Protestantism. Behind it is the same naive, fanatic obsession to be found in the Protestant sects. Moreover the official title of the Watchtower is International Bible Association Watch Tower and Tract Society, Brooklyn, New York. [This jewel Was in English exactly as given.]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(3) The Watchtower is not a religion, according to the leader of the movement himself, but a complete revolution toward an order of things which will transform the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(4) The Watchtower since it does away with the spiritual destiny of humanity, Man’s goal is an EI Dorado altogether earthly. It thus connects up with the Koran, and constitutes a neoJudaism, prqpising the coming of a Messiah who will inaugurate the golden age on earth,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">is not a religion either,</span></p><img src="g_E_19391115_files/g_E_19391115-19.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:149pt;">

<p><span class="font12">Thismovementspreads its propaganda today throughout the entire world. Branches are established in a number of European and American capitals and particularly in Africa. [Note the trail of the serpent in these allu- ' &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">sions to the African Watch Tower.] Even Protestant ministers recognize that it constitutes a very real danger for the church and civilization. Judge Rutherford’s teachings contain the seeds of the worst excesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A few remarks on this subject are necessary. The doctrinal works of the Watchtower condemn Communism and Bolshevism like the rest of Satan’s organization. Only the future Theocracy is legitimate. Textually the Biblical obsession of the Watchtower has nothing in common with Bolshevism itself. The Watchtower does not preach anarchy, but denounces evil and announces general destruction: the great evening is near. It follows that Bolshevism applauds the Watchtower movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is there a positive collusion between the Bolshevist and Watchtower movements? There is no proof of it up to the present. Let it suffice to note that Rutherford is a Jew [A. beautiful, perfect, 100-percent lie.—Ed.] and his doctrines are a form of neo-Judaism. His works are printed by Jewish publishers, [Another 100-percenter.] An enormous capital is at the Watchtower’s disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Following is a letter we and a local Jona-dab sent to. the big noise in charge of the magazine: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 16, 1930</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sir: Some people of your parish have put into our possession your BuHetiw Paroissine </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">de St. Louis de Grenoble</span><span class="font12"> for the month of April, where we find an article on La Tour de Garde and the works of Judge Rutherford. Articles of this kind are not lacking in the Catholic press. Perhaps you have not heard of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald,</span><span class="font12"> of London, who published a report as false as yours, and who, finding themselves faced with a suit for damages, published a retraction and paid the legal costs incurred by their lack of love for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You have knowledge of at least three of the Watchtower publications. Why not cite them to prove your case directly, instead of relying on the opinion of a man who does not even know that the official title of the Watchtower is Watchtower Bible and Tract Society? Your author claims that the Watchtower announces revolution, but you give no proof of it, no more than he does, although you </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font12"> say, “The Watchtower does not preach anarchy, but denounces evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why have you not more respect for the holiest name in the universe, the name of Jehovah? The answer is found in your fourth paragraph, that is to say, in the way you despise the Bible. Yes, indeed, “the Watchtower draws all its doctrines from the Bible.” This is more than you can say for your organization. Your reproach is a compliment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible teaches us that Jehovah is the only true God, that<sup>1</sup> Christ is the legitimate King of all the earth (Psalm 110; Matthew 22:41-46) who will break up this world’s organization like a potter^ vessel. (Psalm 2:7-9) Why, then, do you speak of “the coming of a Messiah”, who, you know full well, is none other than Christ in glory? (Philippians 2: 9-11) Why do you speak in such veiled terms? It is because you know that if you tell the truth, that the Watchtower announces the return of that Christ, thrice dishonored by Judaism—during His earthly life, after His resurrection, and now at His return—your faithful will see how unfounded are your claims. It is because, like Annas and Caiaphas, you do not want the reign of Christ on earth, (Matthew 23:13) Like them, and the Protestant ministers of whom you speak, you see in Christ’s teachings “a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font12"> real danger”. Caiaphas said the same thing. (John 11:47-49) The danger is more “real” than you think it is. You see that He condemns all religion (Matthew 23), those who “for a pretense make</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">21</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">long prayers”, who use “vain repetitions” ((((1 Pater plus 5 Aves) times 10) plus 5 Glorias) times 20), those who turn the house o£ prayer into a den of thieves (Matthew 21:13), those who, inasmuch as they are friends of this world, are enemies of God.—James 4:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The rest of your letter is pitiful. After, having said that “the Watchtower draws all its doctrines from the Bible” (which Communists and Bolshevists despise as much as you), that “the works of the Watchtower condemn Communism and Bolshevism”, that “only the future Theocracy is legitimate” (‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done’; yes, you say it but you do not mean it), you then pretend </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">that it follows</span><span class="font12"> (!!!) that “Bolshevism applauds the Watchtower movement”. Really, sir, you do not flatter the intelligence of your faithful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Kingdom Hall, N. E. London</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">It is enough to read a few pages of the Watchtower’s literature to understand that it announces the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font12"> of Christ, disowned by Judaism and dishonored by you and yours. Since the Watchtower publishes its own books it cannot be a question of “Jewish publishers”. As for the “enormous capital at the Watchtower’s disposal”, you can ill afford that remark, sir. Who has not visited your cathedrals or heard of your Vatican, with their riches of gold and silver and precious stones? Who is unaware of the life your “princes of the church” lead ? But how many think of the travail, the sweat, the weariness of mind and body of the poor who pay for them? (James 5:1-6) And you dare talk of capital. Then be it known to you, sir, that in this Satanic world, in spite of hypocritical religion, big business and bowelless politicians, there are unselfish people, real Christians. Not many, of course, as Paul says, ‘Not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that He might put to shame them that are wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that He might put to shame them that are strong; and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, has God chosen, yea, and the things that are not (nobodies), that He might bring to nought the things that are.’ (1 Corinthians 1:26-28) Aye, Jehovah with this people docs a work that astonishes you; a strange work. (Isaiah 28 :14-22) It seems strange indeed to you that the Watchtower has such success, and so, judging everyone by yourselves, you say, “An enormous capital is at the Watchtower’s disposal.” But the capital at the Watchtower’s disposal is not of the metallic variety, so much </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">sought after by this world, but the boundless might of Jehovah God and His anointed, Christ Jesus. And that might has enabled the Watchtower to distribute 275,600,000 books in seventeen years, which free the people of good will from their spiritual prisons.—Isaiah 61:1,2,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These few lines are not written, as you would have folks understand, “maliciously,” neither to convince you, but that hereafter, and, above all, when Christ renders unto each one according to His own works, you ought not to be able to say, “I did not know.” God has sanctions to enforce against those who call evil good and good evil (Matthew 12:22-24; Isaiah 5:20), and you will take full responsibility for your words. Naturally, you could follow the Catholic </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> example; they retracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As intimated in the letter, its immediate effects on Satan’s “li’l darlings” is not our concern, but, apart from that, we are getting a kick out of the business when we show the article and reply to those who are beginning to see the light. Do they like it ? An interested young lady said that if they (the black-robed ones) did not reply they would be cowards. She was assured by us that there was no doubt of that in any case. It was a joy to see the gusto with which the local Jonadabs joined in sending the letter. —Two pioneers on the French front.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Another boy-seout tin-horn veteran has been discovered. If he had kept his mouth shut nobody would have found it out, but in the flag-worship row at Fort Lee, N. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">J., T. G. </span><span class="font12">Wragge, of Palisades Park, felt that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the time </span><span class="font12">had come to immortalize himself, so he busted into print for two columns in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bergen Evening Record,</span><span class="font12"> telling vvhat a fine patriot he is, a war veteran, always ready to bow to Old Glory, etc., etc., and that Dan Morgan and his boys, Jehovah’s witnesses, should be deported. Then Dan wrote down to Washington, to the adjutant general’s office, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font12">War Department, and found that the 398th Field Artillery, with which Wragge was connected, was not organized until 1921, three years after the war was, over. Inasmuch as Wragge injected himself into this discussion, all will-be</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A challenge was given me by Mr. Morgan about matching his war pecord, but far be it from me to burden you or your readers with a complete history of the 398th Field Artillery with which I served. I will say, however, for Mr. Morgan’s information, that we were not sent to France to throw cream puffs at each other.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>The Three Johnson Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ It is not an edifying spectacle to march three children of tender years off to what is to all intents and purposes a reform school because they haVe held steadfast to their religious principles. There is nothing to indicate that these youngsters or their parents are not, according to their own lights, God-fearing, decent Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It strikes all of us as odd and somewhat sad, perhaps, that any Americans should refuse to cherish and to salute our flag. Nevertheless it is quite possible, even probable, that the Johnsons are patriotic. Those who are fervent enough in their religious convictions ■ to hold them in face of so much public condemnation are of the stuff that martyrs are made of, and deserve something better of this grand country of ours and theirs than jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The compulsory flag salute and the compulsory&quot; teacher's oath are neither wise nor do they foster patriotism. They do, however, smack of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. And that isn’t good for either Massachusetts or the United States.—Springfield </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Union.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The Buddha god is very thin-vSH rO skinned. There is a statue to Bud-VOrljj dha Anuradhapura, in Ceylon, and in a lark a young girl sat in the i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statue’s lap and was photographed</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">by her intended husband. It raised an awful row, and both young people were fined 45e each for defiling the statue. This was not enough, in some eyes, and when they went ’ away on their wedding trip somebody concealed a live cobra in the maid’s trunk, hoping it would kill her when the trunk was opened; but the cobra was killed instead. Despite the Biblical statement, “An idol is nothing in the world,” Buddha is supposed to have been defiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">“Use Not Vain Repetitions”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Christ Jesus, the Lord of life and glory, instructed against the use of prayer wheels and “Hail Marys” when He said, “When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do.” (Matthew 6:7) His instruction did not yet reach to the realm of the gaekwar of Baroda’s folks. They recently pulled off a yaga to the “fire god”, which lasted a month. On the final day they had 200,000 present, each one of whom, as a sort of return for two square meals, was supposed to repeat fifty times one particular Vedic verse praising the “fire god”. The priests on the job, no doubt, convinced all these poor dupes that the more “Hail Marys” they said, the better would be their harvests in the ensuing year. What a farce!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Skillfully Built Tunnels</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The natives of India are among the most skillful tunnel-builders in the world. For their irrigation works they commonly dig tunnels through the big hills, from one valley to another, and though they work from various openings, in both directions, they always meet * exactly at the proper point and at the proper grade. How this is done European engineers have yet to learn.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Down in Travancore, India</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Down in Travancore, India, at the tip of the Indian peninsula, and within a few miles of the equator, are 5,000,000 people, a fourth of whom call themselves Christians. These are the descendants of those to whom the apostle Thomas preached. When Roman Catholic missionaries arrived and began talking about the pope the people of Travancore did not know what they were talking about. They did not know there is such a person. Working hours in Travancore are from 7:30 in the morning until 12:30 in the afternoon. In the afternoon it is too hot to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Cost of Illiteracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Ninety-two percent of the people of India can neither read nor write, but in Japan elementary education is free and compulsory, with the natural result that the Japanese standard of living is continuously rising, while India is repeatedly swept with disease, due to the fact that the women know so little of sanitation or anything else. Owing to the lack of education of the men the yield of the land is less than half what it is in England.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>India Would Defend British Empire</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In mid-September, when it looked so much like another world war, ten Indian rulers sent telegrams to the viceroy of India in which they unreservedly placed all their forces at the disposal of the British Government, and that without regard to any domestic differences, big or little, which the Indian states have had or still have with the Government of India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The United States now has more than $15,000,000,000 in gold. William S. Wasserman, Philadelphia financier and economist, thinks it about time that Uncle Sam makes use of this gold to purchase raw material from the democratic countries now forced to barter with Germany and other t o t a 1 i t a r ian powers. He thinks, with good reason, too, that if the buying of gold by this country is continued long enough it will be— only a matter of time until the rest of the world will abandon gold entirely, and we will be left with metal altogether valueless save for an extremely limited use in industry and the arts.</span></p>

Meantime 10,000 plants have been selected and furnished with definite schedules of war needs, and as soon as mobilization day comes the manufacture of munitions can begin at once. And from the looks of th? American stock market it can but be guessed that many of the 10,000 plants are . looking hopefully and expectantly . for War business. How else explain the sky-rocketing of stocks ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ In February, 1939, the Federal debt reached the new high of $39,798,893,142, and Uncle Sam’s stock of gold hit the new high of $14,700,000,000, with big shipments on the way. That was a bright idea Uncle Sam had of raising the price of gold. The natural result was that the South African gold output in 1938 was the greatest in history.</span></p>

He is somebody who eats on the government, which eats on you. If a government quartered troops in your house without your permission, you would know that debt is living with you. If you have a family of eight, there are two others supported in your household, although you don’t see them. This is invisible taxation, but the people who live at your expense are very much alive and get the first helping. Every time you go to a picture show and buy four tickets for your family, you have paid for one for a government man. You buy ten gallons of gasoline and the government gets two and one-half gallons at your expense with which to joyride.</span></p>

That is every person of any age. The estimated average income per capita of the people of Canada in 1937 was $438. How can a people making only an average of $438 per year pay $121.50 for governments and slay alive?</span></p>

Let us not be caught sleeping. Germany and the other totalitarian States are looking with covetous eyes on this rich and undeveloped country. We must face the issue and bring into play that spirit of self-sacrifice and loyalty in these peace times that was so admirably exhibited in the years 1914 to 1918, if we are to retain that for which a generation of young Canadians fought.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sy J. H emery (London)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Britain at War</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• The fact that Britain is at war dominates the whole thought of the country and very definitely affects almost every condition of life. Yet, in the military aspect things are very different from the early days of that which has so regularly been called the Great War, Then for a time all was commotion, and there was much excitement. Men in khaki were to be seen everywhere, in the streets, and in the countryside, men on the march ot in training. In 1914, although war clouds had threatened, they dispersed quickly, till suddenly came a thunderbolt out of a blue sky. The one who in Germany called himself the “All Highest” suddenly decided to take the advice of his war lords, decided that the chance to crush France * had come, and with that the long-wished-for opportunity to make Germany the dominant power in Europe. All the -world knows that Germany took the wrong road when setting out for Paris. Blindly refusing to see the signs in London, and refusing to listen to clear words of warning, Germany’s war lords suddenly found themselves opposed by the might of the British Empire as well as that of France. Before long the whole world was involved in the mighty conflicts which arose out of that aggression, and thus began that series of spasms of trouble of which Jesus said, “These are the beginnings of sorrows,” sorrows which should not end till they had culminated, as He said, in the time of trouble spoken of by Daniel the prophet. To Daniel’s words Jesus added that the like would never happen again, &quot;fw then the Son of Man would appear in His power, and the rule of evil would be broken by the full establishment of His kingdom. (See Matthew 24:21,29,30.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now, a quarter of a century later, the same nations are again involved in war. This time began under different circumstances, and the entrance into the conflict is as different as the cause. For a whole month there has been exceptional quiet in London, and the same is true of a large section of the land. Rationing of petrol has taken much traffic from the streets, and the complete black-out keeps peo-pie within doors at nights; the means of public travel are much curtailed, both by rail and by road. It might be added that the paucity of news of the war handed out by the Government has done something to keep down excitement—there are many complaints about the acts of the Ministry of Information, both in its reservation of news (already known throughout the world) and in bungling its business. At the present time it has 999 persons in its employ: perhaps it lacks another one. And, as if nature were giving a hand to the peace of the city and country, a peaceful time before a storm, September has been a grand harvest month, plenty of sunshine by day and nights which the harvest moon brightened. The people say, “This is a strange war,” and so it seemed after the very abrupt air-raid warning which immediately followed the prime minister’s announcement on Sunday morning, September 3. If the days are yet quiet and the people not excited there is no indication of a slackening of support for the Government in the action it has taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The cause of the war is certainly unusual. In days which seem remote Britain went to war with one or another nation in Europe to preserve what was called “the balance of power”. No doubt the politicians which threw the country into those wars could always give a good political reason for their acts: they were not just playing a game, nor starting a fight to give a restless lot of army leaders something to do. This war may be said to have two causes so far as Britain (and France) are concerned. The Government in London, with its national relationships and responsibilities throughout the world, is faced with the fact that a nation strong in numbers and military power is ruled by a man who is obsessed with ambition for power, who is amoral and has a set purpose of ruling a great part of the earth according to his pleasure. His hold over Germany, with his chance of using that great nation as his instrument, has allowed him to persuade himself that he can ultimately dominate the European democracies and reduce them to submission to himself. The growth of his power through Europe has become a threat to the existence of those nations; increased, as Hitler purposes, and the end of the British Government and all that it stands for in its relation to the free peoples of the Commonwealth would be in sight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' - ■ ■ -</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The things involved and for which the British Government has taken up arms are</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">very varied. Without any comment on the form of civilization which obtains in the democracies, except to say that its liberties are violated in wholesale fashion, it is nevertheless such a form as allows a man to feel himself free. There is liberty for thoughts and ideas to be expressed, whether of the individual or of communities; there is the liberty of the press; there is liberty for the artificer or the laborer to sell his work to best advantage. 'J’here is what so many prize, liberty of conscience in religious worship; and liberty for a man to tell others what ho believes, and to try to convert others to his opinions. There is liberty for Labor to organize itself to its advantage, to carry on a warfare against oppressions of Capital, to voice itself in Parliament, and, as has been demonstrated, liberty to get constitutional control of the Government of the country. The same liberty is exploited by the great financial interests; but in all conditions easy or hard the liberty of the subject is a preeious thing. With Hitlerism rampant all this would vanish from most of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Britain has entered into this serious matter for the preservation of the empire and for all the interests involved in its life, and, as far as may be, for the destruction of those evil forces which have begun to threaten the peace and happiness of all men. It does not consider it has entered a desperate adventure, however hard a one it may prove to be; for there is confidence that with France, and the good will of the free peoples of the earth, the desired end will be gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The war makes a deeper appeal-than that of 1914: the present call is on a higher note, and as religion is deeply involved in the consequences—its existence being threatened-all sections are throwing their weight into support of the Government. AH the leaders of religion see and well understand that if Nazism spreads itself abroad through the earth, as its chief exponent purposes in his heart it shall do, religion as represented in the systems will be crushed into servitude to the State or be destroyed. Judging from their history it might be expected that the larger systems would accept servitude. But their claim that they are the kingdom of heaven on earth would be gone with the wind. They would be known for what they are now in fact, mere actors in their performances, and would be openly reduced to a “moral force”—immoral in reality—and would be in . the same position as the astrologers, magicians and soothsayers, the tamed religionists whom Nebuchadnezzar kept for state purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This comment is by no means intended to suggest that ■ all who support the religious systems are seeking the interests of religion in giving their support to the Government: there are honest men who seek the good of humanity, and have not yet come to see that ■which the chiefs of religion have seen; they are concerned to seek to free the earth from the set of gangsters who, by the aid of the Devil, are abroad in the earth. There are yet multitudes of men of good will who have not as yet seen the real place of religion, nor understood the truth of the matter, that God has raised up a people to declare the establishment of TIis kingdom and tell what the kingdom of heaven really is. They do not yet know that religion is as a dark body producing an eclipse darkness in respect to the Scriptures and the purpose of God as there declared; that its message is vitiated by their private interpretations of its words.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>The Kingdom of Heaven</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• When it is denied that the kingdom of heaven was set in the earth in the way claimed by the churches and that they have any right whatever to their claim that they represent the Lord Jesus and in fact are His kingdom, they immediately quote words of Jesus which, they say, prove without question that His kingdom did begin with His ministry. There is no question about that fact; what is in question is their perversion of His words and the purport of what Tie said, and the assumption that these systems, any one of them, or all together, are the kingdom of heaven, or have any say in anything connected with His kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">In the earlier days of His ministry Jesus spoke to Nicodemus about the Kingdom, and said that one must be born again before he could see or enter into the kingdom of God: he must “be born of water and of the spirit”. All those who by the grace of God have accepted Jesus and the truth concerning His Father and himself which He brought from God, who have consecrated themselves to God, and have been begotten of the spirit, have been made heirs of the kingdom of God, and made members of His ehureh. These are those of whom Jesus said, “Fear not, little flock ; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 32) But not one of these has had any thought other than that of patient waiting, and patient endurance which they must sustain, until the time should come when the Lord Jesus should return from heaven, again sent by His Father, and should set, up the Kingdom in power, according as God had by His prophets so long declared. That return has ever been the hope of the faithful, and it has sustained them in the persecutions by potentates, who hate the thought of the rule of Christ, and by those fierce religionists who have assumed a right to rule in the name of Christ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">False teachers got an entrance into the communities of the early disciples and believers, and as “men slept” the Devil got his evil seeds sown. The false ideas bore their fruits, and by the time of the emperor Constantine these false men had become a power in Rome. Constantine got persuaded that when these men talked of the kingdom of heaven they meant no opposition to his empire; that this was their manner of worship, and that they were ready to co-operate with him. From that time forward, sometimes slowly, but always surely, the false church of Rome increased in power, the circumstances of the falling empire aiding them. In true Nazi fashion the “church” increased its claims, in the name of God and of Christ, and in time laid claim to rule both Rome and all the kings of earth. As the Protestant systems came into existence they carried with them from Rome, not only the blinding dogmas of doctrine, but also this assumption that the “church” (how the churches they established) was the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All the churches accept the fact that, according to the Scriptures, a kingdom of heaven will be in full rule in the earth—they cannot do otherwise unless they refute the Scriptures altogether; but they one and all persist in putting that kingdom off into the far future, to the time when they shall have fully persuaded all men to accept them and their dogmas, &lt;w themselves as their true rulers, as, in theory at least, all Roman Catholics accept the rule of the pope of Rome. That the Lord will eome when lie is not expected, and not wanted, they will not allow. It has pleased God to raise up a witness to the truth of His Word, and to himself at this time, and to have these, as Jesus foretold, proclaim the Kingdom among the nations, and that the time is come. That has been and is being proclaimed throughout the earth, by Jehovah’s witnesses, for whom Judge Rutherford is spokesman, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">both they and he—he particularly—are evil spoken of and their message derided. The history of the days of Jesus in the flesh </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">of the apostles is being repeated. But the Kingdom is here, and the work of proclaiming it is being done, and the foretold signs are abroad in the earth as Jesus said they would be.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• The National Register has been taken: every person is ticketed. The immediate purpose is to give each person an identity card, and to provide for food for each person. It is imperative that each one shall carry the card, both for his own safety and for the country’s check on him. The policeman and others have the right to ask for its production from .the person. It is said that there is an abundance of food in the land; but the Government has a big job on hand in making its arrangements. It has been busily occupied in planting its stores in places of safety and in readiness for distribution. That some of its planning has broken down is not to be wondered at, in view of the vastness of its tasks.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Germany and Russia</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• The entrance of Russia into the war area in Poland, and Stalin’s pact with the Hitlerites, has darkened the skies in the east, but it cannot be said that Russia’s action has affected the purpose of the British people to carry on with its avowed purpose of having Germany and Europe, and the world, for that matter, delivered from the ruthless men who proclaim themselves as men of peace. Whether that purpose will be accomplished remains to be seen, but there is no doubt about the in ten-, tion. It is worth while remembering that Germany holds a large number of Communists, very much in harmony with the Bolshevik ideas which are supposed to control Russia, and that it may well be that Hitler has opened a door which will let his avowed enemy ideology inside his fortress. Whatever happens in the results of this upheaval, which surely will shake the world, those who see the fulfillments of the prophecies know that there is in these things further evidence that the end of the rule of Satan is fast hastening on, and, by the same token, that the rule of the kingdom of God’s Son is near. Those who will see may see, and God has provided fullest means for enlightenment for them, and that they may find a place of confidence and of safety, with assurance of life in that kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">THE aggressor States have grown immensely during the last three yeans. They have formed a bloc in order to defend the principle of AjL aggression and will defend hud justify one another even when one of them is infringing upon the rights and interests of another. There are eases, too, of joint aggression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The responsibility, ladies and gentlemen, for these regrettable facts lies with those States that restrained the-League from resistance to the aggressors when they were still weak and divided. They have since attempted to break the peace, and, thanks to the impunity with which they have been allowed to break one international treaty after another, to the propaganda for aggression, and to the policy of concession, negotiation and baek-stage intrigue with them, they have since grown strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is, however, another conception, which recommends as the height of human wisdom, under the cover of ‘^pacifism”, that the aggressor be treated with consideration and his vanity be not wounded. It -recommends conversations and negotiations to be carried on with him, that he be assured that no collective action will ever be taken against him, and, even though he enters into collusion with other aggressors, that compromise agreements be concluded with him and his breaches of former agreements be overlooked and that his demands, even the most illegal, be fulfilled. And that one State after another be sacrificed to him and that, if possible, no question of his activity be raised at the League of Nations because the aggressor does not like it, he takes offense and sulks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Unfortunately, this is just the policy that has been pursued toward the aggressor. Three ■wars have fhreatened to bring down on us a fourth.

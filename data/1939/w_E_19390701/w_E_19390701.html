<p><span class="font5">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos Is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that mau willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death In order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind ; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness In the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ITS MISSION</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All sincere students of the Bible who by reason of infirmity, poverty or adversity are unable to pay the subscription price may have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> free upon written application to the publishers, made once each year, stating the reason for so requesting it. We are glad to thus aid the needy, but the written application once each year is required by the postal regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Notice to Subscribers:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Acknowledgment of a new or a renewal subscription will be sent only when requested. Change of address, when requested, may be expected to appear on address label within one month. A renewal blank (carrying notice of expiration) will be sent with the journal one month before the subscription expires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Entered as second-class matter at the post office at Brooklyn, N.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7., </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">under the Act of March S, 1S19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notice! The Brooklyn factory and office will be closed for the two weeks beginning Saturday, July 22, and concluding Sunday, August 6. This will enable the Bethel family, after a year of consistent strenuous activity here, to get away for a temporary change and to enjoy opportunities of field service in common with the other Kingdom publishers. All publishers will therefore order in advance enough supplies of literature to last them over the Bethel vacation period, and to the end of August. Do this in good time to allow for shipment from here before the factory closes Friday evening, July 21. No orders will be filled and shipped, nor mail be opened and answered, during this vacation period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All brethren should write to the Society in English whenever possible. Letters written in foreign languages, such as Italian, Greek, Polish, etc., require extra time and work to handle. The suggestion is offered that foreign-speaking companies select as secretary some young brother or sister who speaks and writes English as well as the foreign language. This person can then write all letters to the Society in English at the dictation of the company servant, and when written the company servant can sign the letters. This will result in more prompt handling of your orders and letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brethren who live in countries outside of the United States and in which countries there arc branch offices of the Society should write to such branch offices rather than to Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">USE RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION BLANK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blank sent you one month before expiration of your </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font5"> subscription should be filled out and returned to the Brooklyn office or to the Branch office in the country where you reside. Servants in the companies, and individuals, when sending in renewals for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> should always use these blanks. By filling in these renewal blanks you are assured of the continuation of your </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from the time of expiration, and without delay. It will also be a great help if you sign your name uniformly, and note any recent change of address, on the renewal slip</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for ivater, but of hearing the words of the<sup>1</sup> Lord&quot;—Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TEHOVAH pronounced the doom of religion in I general, and specifically the doom of what is called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8"> “the Christian religion”. The latter specifically reproaches Jehovah’s name. That religious system, by the use of the name Christ, is a mockery and a defamation of God’s holy name and is marked with hypocrisy from beginning to end. This is corroborative proof that religion is the creature and instrument of the Devil, brought into action for the very purpose of deceiving men and reproaching the name of Jehovah. The Devil has pursued his own crooked and wicked way, and that without let or hindrance until God’s due time to take action, and then, as the Scriptures clearly show, Jehovah maneuvers the forces of the Devil and brings them right into the place required for destruction according to his will. Jehovah now reveals to his faithful people these truths that their faith and hope may be strong and fail not. Feeding upon the Word of God, the faithful witnesses rejoice, knowing what will be the end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> That among the religionists there is today a great famine in the land called “Christendom”, for the hearing of the Word of God, there can not be the slightest doubt. The provender which the religious leaders have dished up and handed out to the people is without any food value whatsoever, and, instead of ministering life, peace and happiness to the people, that provender ministers unto them grief, spiritual sickness and death. There is an abundance of truth in God’s organization, and this declared by Jehovah’s witnesses is a marked contrast to the famine conditions that exist amongst the religionists. Seeing the result upon their pastures by reason of the proclamation of the truth, and that that result is the burning up of their pastures, the religionists howl and attempt to destroy the faithful men and women who, as God’s servants and under God’s command, bring to the attention of the people the truth and point them to the real, life-giving and life-sustaining food which the Lord has provided for those that love him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> God’s chosen and holy nation, selected and equipped by the Lord to make known his name, and now used for that purpose, appears upon the scene at his command. They come without any desire or reason to use carnal weapons against anyone. They do not use carnal weapons, but that nation does work depredation and destruction upon the hypocritical religion and religious systems, and concerning this God’s prophet says: “He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.”—Joel 1: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> The land of “Christendom&quot;, speaking by its religious leaders, claims to be God’s “vine”, that is, the visible expression of his kingdom on earth, and even the head of the religious system claims to be “the vicegerent of Christ”. The claim is entirely false and hypocritical to the last degree, but God permits them to make such claim and to go the full limit and then foretells the doom of religion and of religious practices. God sends forth his servants, the anointed remnant and their companions, his “other sheep”, to deliver his message against religion, and such message shows what “Christendom” really is. That message discloses that religion is a fraud and a snare and a racket, held forth in contrast to Christianity, and is a fraudulent representation of Christ. The truth declared shows that Christianity is true and that Christians are the ones who faithfully serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King. Religion is shown as a waste and fruitless toward God, because it is against his King and kingdom. The truth discloses that “Christendom” has no cause for joy but is empty and void, having none of the “joy of the Lord” and no part in the kingdom of God, which shall vindicate his holy name. “Christendom,” which practices the so-called “Christian religion”, brings no joy or good cheer to God or man. (Judg. 9:13) That is a great calamity to those “drinkers of wine” of Babylon and who become “drunkards” upon such wine and who are commanded by the Lord to wake up and to view their deplorable condition. (Joel 1:5) Hearing that alarm at the mouth of the Lord repeated by his faithful witnesses on earth makes the religionists exceedingly mad, and they froth at the mouth and threaten all manner of violence against Jehovah’s witnesses and do what they can to carry out their violent desires.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">‘As Jerusalem was the original planting of the Lord and became unfaithful, so “Christendom” for centuries has claimed to be the “vine” of God, and, it being in an implied covenant to perform accordingly, God speaks of the same now as “my vine”, “my fig tree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• Christ Jesus and the members of his body are “trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah”, that bring glory to Jehovah’s name. (Isa. 61:3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> “Christendom” loudly claims to be that tree of God’s planting, but the claim is false and, instead of bringing joy to the Lord, they bring great reproach to his name. “Christendom” has long claimed to be God’s “fig tree”, but she has brought forth no fruit whatsoever to the glory of the Lord. Therefore says the Lord: “He hath . . . barked my fig tree [(according to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font8"> hath turned . . . my figtree to splinters].” The Lord’s message now sent forth by him through his faithful witnesses discloses that “Christendom” is totally barren of fruit and worthless because she has abandoned God and his kingdom and has sought promotion from Satan and hence is now a tree stripped even of its bark, dried up and dead. “Christendom,” being one of the trees of Satan, has sought to have the name of Christ attached to her, and hence, as stated in the parable, has said to God’s true fig tree: “Come . . . and reign over us,” but let us pursue our own selfish course. The scripture of the parable gives the answer: “But the fig tree [the true one] said unto them [Satan’s trees], Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees [of the Devil’s organization]?” (Judg. 9:11) God’s true fig tree avoids the Devil’s organization, knowing that it is a deadly thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ The “fig tree” is a symbol of God’s “holy nation” or kingdom. Jehovah selected Israel as his typical people, picturing his kingdom, and before that people were set the prospects of the kingdom; and when Christ Jesus came to that nation he pronounced his Father’s curse upon it because that nation had been unfaithful and had brought forth no fruit. (Matt. 21:19,20) Christ Jesus, with his apostles, set up the Christian organization, which organization is God’s and must be wholly obedient to God’s commandments. Soon thereafter ambitious men associated themselves with God’s organization, and those selfish and ambitious men soon substituted religion and religious practices for the true service of God. This they did, of course, because they were overreached by Satan the Devil. To be sure, God knew this from the beginning and for that reason foretold it by his holy prophets. He foretold that “Christendom” would fail and that the kingdom prospects would be entirely removed from her. Now God sends forth his faithful remnant who have been gathered by Christ Jesus to the temple and these faithful witnesses are commanded to deliver and do deliver God’s message, and the truth declared by them exposes “Christendom” as a false fig tree; and concerning it the prophet Joel says: “He hath made it clean bare.” This shows, together with the undisputed facts, that the kingdom has been taken away from unfaithful “Christendom” and given to the nation (God’s holy nation) bringing forth the fruits thereof, even as the Lord foretold. (Matt. 21:43) This strips “Christendom” clean bare of the kingdom fruit in the eyes of all his people of good will. In the parable the Lord foretold this result: “He spake also this parable: A certain [one, Jehovah] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser [Christ Jesus] of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree [the Jewish nation], and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.”—Luke 13: 6-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> As Jehovah permitted Israel to go on for eighteen centuries, so he has suffered “Christendom” to continue falsely claiming to represent Jehovah until the coming of Christ Jesus to his kingdom, particularly since his coming to the temple in 1918, at which time every hope and prospect has been taken away from “Christendom”, pictured by the barking and cutting down of that fig tree. The result is that “Christendom” is now a castaway and, according to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font8"> God has “cast it down”. Jehovah sends his witnesses declaring his truth, thus casting down the religion which is called “the Christian religion”, and shows that the same is an abomination to him and that he has completely disowned “Christendom” and that it is entirely cast away from him. The branches of that unfaithful tree are bleached and made like ashes, and “Christendom” is a disreputable and forlorn sight. The publication of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font8"> in 1937, brought these facts prominently to the attention of honest people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> The message of God’s truth, which exposes “Christendom” and her so-called “Christian religion&quot;, shows that religion to be a fraud and a snare completely separate and distinct from Christianity and in opposition to Christianity, and hence separates “Christendom” from Christ Jesus, the Bridegroom: and so the Lord says to “Christendom”: &quot;Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[{Rotherham)</span><span class="font8"> the owner] of her youth.” (Joel 1: 8) The prospect of becoming the bride of Christ was once set before “Christendom”, and because of unfaithfulness that prospect has been entirely removed and now she is bereft of that prospect entirely and, like a cast-off and disowned virgin, “Christendom” is shown as being in deep grief and anguish. Jehovah tells her to weep and howl, and she does. Jehovah’s witnesses come with God’s message of truth informing “Christendom” that she has lost the one, Christ Jesus, to whom she supposed that she was espoused. “Christendom,” and particularly the leaders of her religious system, howl and declare that this “strange work” now carried on in the earth is Communistic and seditious, and that Jehovah’s witnesses are Communists and seditionists. They call upon their political allies to enforce the laws of the land against Jehovah’s witnesses on the theory that such witnesses are Communists and seditionists. The papa of the Vatican City is exposed by the truth and is shown not to be the vicegerent of Christ, the Bridegroom, and hence the claim made for that high dignitary is false and fraudulent. Hearing the sound of the message delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses from God’s Word the clergy or religious leaders become hysterical and rush about seeking the restraint and destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. God’s “strange work” hurts them and fills them with great rage, but this is nothing as to how they will feel when Jehovah performs “his act, his strange act”, at Armageddon. Let it be understood that what is here said is not directed against individuals nor prompted by hate, but against a system, the offices of which are filled by men, and it is the religion and religious system that have brought great reproach upon Jehovah’s name, and such fraud he now exposes by his Word of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;"> A</span><span class="font8"> calamity has come upon “Christendom”, of which the Lord long ago foretold through his prophet: &quot;The meat offering [(7?.F.) The meal offering] and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord’s ministers, mourn.” (Joel 1:9) “Christendom’s” grain fields and vineyards are smitten so that there is no corn produced to offer to the Lord as the first-fruits or to make a meal offering, nor are there any grapes to make wine to pour it as a drink offering unto the Lord. Jehovah’s locust plague has consumed the crops of &quot;Christendom” so that there is no fruit or drink, and hence their religion cannot be carried on as in the past. There is no real wine of the Lord amongst them to make glad the heart, and no bread from heaven to strengthen them. (Ps. 104:15) Because of this calamity the priests of &quot;Christendom” mourn and howl.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> As the prophecy was fulfilled in miniature upon Jerusalem, so now it is fulfilled in completeness upon &quot;Christendom”. God, foreknowing what would come upon “Christendom”, used his typical people to foretell the calamity that is now upon the religious practices. The Lord’s message today makes known that he has cut off all such religious offerings through his true sanctuary, and that includes the “elective elder” crowd. The sanctuary has been cleansed, and now the true worshipers of God must &quot;offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. (Mal. 3:1-3) The Lord does not ask for nor will he receive religious offerings, because the same are a reproach to his name. It means that such offerings God regards as an abomination, and the one who offers them is described in these words: “He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.”—Isa. 66: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> The sleepers who have had too much of Babylon’s wine from “the vine of the earth” wake up and find themselves out of jobs and their pastures well stripped and burned. They have been hoodwinking the people for a long season, but now the message of Jehovah exposes their religious racket and the people of good will toward God forsake the religious systems and flee to Christ for refuge. The clergy have thought more of a job than of the Lord, and now they mourn because they are in a dreadful dilemma. The Lord by his prophet (Joel 2:17) advised the preachers and the clergy and other religionists what to do, but they refuse to give heed to such advice. Jehovah’s witnesses make known by proclaiming the truth of God’s Word that the Hierarchy clergy are not the servants of Jehovah; and that message of truth makes the clergy very mad, and they make a loud howl, because they know their racket is found out and that they have come far short of God’s requirements, and have failed. Likewise the “evil servant” class resents the publication of the Lord’s judgment against them. That class is ‘cut asunder’ from God’s organization, and their portion is appointed with the other hypocrites and they howl and gnash their teeth. (Matt. 24:48-51) The two classes together make up “the man of sin”, &quot;the son of perdition,” and they are both now arrayed against God and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah’s “strange work”, which has now progressed for several years, has uncovered “the refuge of lies” (Isa. 28:15-17) and the practice of hypocrisy; and the wide devastation that has come upon “Christendom” is further described by the prophet in these words: “The field is wasted, the land mourn-eth; for the corn is wasted; the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.”—Joel 1:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">“Jehovah’s &quot;strange work” makes the religious fields a miserable sight like a field the vegetation of which has been destroyed by pests. The land shows no sign of fertility, and the beauty of growing crops and fruits has entirely disappeared. Such is the present state of &quot;Christendom”, in which there is a famine for the hearing of the Word of God. “Christendom” now becomes a by-word and a stench, and the Lord describes it in this language: “The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourneth, and fadeth away; the world languisheth, and fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. The eaTth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.”— Isa. 24:3-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> The clergy and religious leaders of “Christendom”, instead of giving heed to the counsel of the Lord, grow indignant, and they cry out to the people: “What we need is more religion.” The Lord laughs at them in derision, and the honest people know, that religion is a snare and fake and a racket. Hence the true ones are earnestly seeking Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus, and rendering service unto the Most High. In “Christendom” three elements control, namely, religion, politics and commercial traffickers, and these have been fully linked up together and been trying to hold each other up, and the politicians, with the clergy, shout: “Give us more religion.” Jehovah describes the situation in these words: “For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing [cursing] the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course [violence] is evil, and their force is not right. For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the Lord. Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein; foi* I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 23:10-12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> In “Christendom” there is no substantial, basic food available: “For the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up [ashamed (7?.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">V.)</span><span class="font8">; is abashed </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)],</span><span class="font8"> and the [olive] oil languisheth.” Such is the present-day condition of “Christendom”. She is without spiritual nourishment, and hence the religionists look to the politicians and the money-changers to hold “Christendom’s” organization together. There is no more “joy of the Lord” amongst the religionists, because now they are against Jehovah God and against his King and kingdom and have gone entirely away to Satan and his world and have become a part of it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord is revealing these truths today for the special aid and benefit of the people of good will, the Jonadabs, and, this information coming to them, they discern the miserable situation of religion and religionists, and they are fleeing to God’s kingdom that they might there find protection and refuge before and during Armageddon. Many sincere people have been under the influence and control of religious systems of “Christendom”, and now those of good will are quickly separating themselves from the unrighteous and unholy thing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1T</sup> The message of Jehovah’s kingdom proclaimed within the hearing of the religionists is a torment to them, but they do not give heed thereto and seek the way of reformation and forgiveness; and so the Lord says to “Christendom”, and particularly to the religious leaders, who have planted the religious seed: “Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.”—Joel 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> The clergy, instead of sowing the seed of God’s kingdom and pointing to it as the only hope of the world, have planted the seed of the wicked one Satan, and their present day of calamity is now upon them and is due to their unfaithfulness to God. Not willing to be honest with themselves and openly confess their wrongful course, they go on hypocritically scattering religious seed, indulging in politics, and all other worldly schemes, and that without shame. God’s published message has brought to the attention of “Christendom” the miserable condition in which she finds herself, but it does not cause them to repent. The clergy angrily denounce Jehovah’s witnesses, who at God’s command bring this message within their reach, and thus they fight against God and against his kingdom. The clergy claim, and for a long time have claimed, to be the “vinedressers” and “husbandmen” of the Lord on the earth, but such is only a pretense. They serve God with their mouths, but, as Jesus said of them, their hearts are removed far from him. (Matt. 15: 6-9) They drink deep of the wine of “the vine of the earth” and openly commit fornication with the Devil’s organization. (Rev. 14:18-20; Rev. 17:1,2; Jas. 4:4) “Christendom” and her religious leaders, in particular, spurn God’s kingdom, continue to indulge in religious practices, and hence have no “feast of weeks” or of harvest. The Lord does not show any more favor to such practitioners of hypocrisy. The time is here to feed the “great multitude”, the Lord’s “other sheep”, and, instead of having some part in doing that work to the glory of the Lord, the religionists put forth their strongest endeavors to deprive the “great multitude” of the opportunity of learning of God and of his King and kingdom. Thus, as did the Pharisees, they refuse to enter into or support the kingdom, and do all they can to keep others from receiving the blessings thereof.—Matt. 23:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> Religion has been the chief means of bringing reproach to the name of Jehovah; and since “Christendom” has become entirely religious and antiChristian and hence against the kingdom of God under Christ, Jehovah has taken away from her all favors; and concerning which he foretold through his prophet the following: “The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered; because joy is withered away from the sons of men.” (Joel 1:12) God has made it hot for religionists by “turning on the heat” since the coming of Christ Jesus. This is the effect of the expression of his indignation against hypocrisy. The scorching, dry season is upon “Christendom”, and her days of grief are here. God foretold the present-day conditions also through his prophet in the following words: “And now, go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down; and' I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.”— Isa. 5:5-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> By the words of his prophet aforesaid the Lord specifically described the devastation of “Christendom” and of all the religious systems. Thus it is seen, as Jesus foretold, the kingdom interests are completely removed from “Christendom” and God has turned on the heat and dried her up. (Matt. 21:19,20) The pomegranate tree furnished the design for the temple and for the temple service (Ex. 28: 33, 34); and Palestine, the land of promise, was called “a land of . . . pomegranates”. (Deut. 8:8; Num. 13:23) The “palm tree” here mentioned evidently means the fruit-bearing date-palm (2 Chron. 31:5, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font8">; and the “apple tree”, the fruit of which is a source of comfort, is like that described in Proverbs 25:11. Furthermore, says the prophet, “even all the trees of the field are withered.” All are barren and have no sign of the kingdom of God. Why? Because “joy is withered away from the sons of men”. There is in “Christendom” no joy of the Lord, because none of the religionists and religious leaders of “Christendom” rejoice in the coming of the kingdom of God under Christ. They have no interest in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, but, on the contrary, they cast in their lot with Satan, the god of this world of wickedness. (2 Cor. 4:4; Jas. 4:4) Since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, in 1918, the joy of the true lovers of God and his King and kingdom continues to increase, but the hatred and bitter opposition to that kingdom and its supporters increase with the religionists. Both the ultrareligionists and the “evil servant” class are totally without joy of the Lord. Therefore with them, as with all who hold to Satan’s organization, it is a time of great woe. (Rev. 12:12) By another of his prophets Jehovah describes “Christendom’s” miserable state in these words: “There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.”—Isa. 24:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>21</sup> While the woes upon the world increase and the religionists, particularly the clergy, continue their ever-increasing bitter persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful remnant and companions rejoice, and so these words are put in the mouth of such by the Lord and they sing: “Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” —Hab. 3:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOWL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> As is well known by all, and admitted by themselves, the leaders in the practice of religion are those who compose the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the clergy; and these, together with the “evil servant” class, forming 'the man of sin, the son of perdition’ crowd, although professing no alliance with each other,.work together. Jehovah having entered final judgment against them and made known that judgment, he tells that crowd to listen to what he has to say to them and then howl: “Gird yourselves [with sackcloth (7?.T<sup>7</sup>.)], and lament, ye priests; howl, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.”—Joel 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>23</sup> In the miniature fulfillment of this prophecy the priestly company served at the altar, but the nonpriestly Levites were not permitted in the inner court where the altar was situated. Now in the complete fulfillment of the prophecy upon “Christendom” the priestly class, the clergy and the “evil servant” class, have assumed to serve at God’s altar, all of such claiming to be the priests and representatives of God on earth. Such priests see and hear the spread of the proclamation of Jehovah’s judgment against religion, and particularly against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is the highest expression of religion. These priests grow frantic and tear their hair and pound their breast with vexation and rage at the devastating effect of the message. They see their many parishioners slipping away from them and their pastures denuded. Foreknowing this, God in derision says to them: ‘Howl, ye ministers of the altar, ye have assumed to be the ministers of God and still claim to be such; therefore come lie all night in sackcloth and ashes, ye ministers of my God, which ye claim to be.’ It is truly the nighttime, because now darkness covers the earth, particularly concerning religion. The facts now well known show that the very thing the prophecy of Joel foretold is now taking place amongst those “ministers” who have been feeding upon the things offered at the altar, and so these privileges are now taken away from them. And why should they not howl? Their income is being cut down and their pastures dried up or burned up, and they are out of a job and their days are about finished. So God tells them to mourn all night because Armageddon is near. Jehovah continues to send forth his servants to proclaim the message of truth, and this they do “day and night”, meaning all the time, and that fact intensifies the anger of the clergy and they continue to howl. Being wrapped in sackcloth does not permit them to have a very peaceful sleep. Their official garments serve no good purpose to alleviate their miseries. Their newspapers now being published throughout the earth rant and fume, and indulge in all manner of lies against Jehovah’s witnesses because of the proclamation of God’s truth, and thus they by spite and ill will advertise God’s messengers and his message of the kingdom. The Catholic publications have much to say against Jehovah’s witnesses, and in doing so their publications arouse the interest among honest subjects, the “Catholic population”, and these honest ones are induced to investigate. Thus they find the truth and flee from the religious organizations, that they may find refuge under Christ. Of course, this brings about further devastating effect upon the Hierarchy, causing the honest seekers who have been amongst the religionists to withhold their patronage and financial support. The people are getting no spiritual food from the religious leaders, and the honest ones see that there is no further occasion for them to bring any financial support to the religionists to keep them going. The famine is on in “Christendom” for the hearing of the spiritual truth. The religionists have no spiritual food but, they being constantly angered, their howl constantly increases. Frantically the religious leaders demand of their political allies that something be done to stop those “pestiferous” Jehovah’s witnesses. As a result, in the legislative assemblies laws are proposed which, if enacted and enforced, would deprive the sincere Christians of hearing the truth of God’s Word. The effort to enact such laws advertises the miseries of the religionists, and also advertises the truth of God’s Word, so that the truth concerning the kingdom is preached under all circumstances; and this makes the religionists howl more and more with ever-increasing anger.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> Who is responsible for this state of famine in the land of “Christendom”? The religious clergy declare that Jehovah’s witnesses, whom they call “Communists”, are the responsible ones. In this they are very wrong again. The faithful Christians who are proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom are not Communists. They are entirely separate from all political parties or companies, and their devotion and service is to Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ, and to none other. Who, then, has brought about the famine in “Christendom”? The correct answer is given by God’s prophet in these words, to wit: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord; and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.”—Amos 8:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>25</sup> Mark this, that Jehovah says: “I will send a famine in the land.” He makes it clear that he is the one that has brought about this condition of devastation upon “Christendom”, and this because of the unfaithfulness of those who have assumed to represent him but who have shown themselves to be out-and-out hypocrites, and he declares that “the hypocrite’s hope shall perish”. (Job 8:13) The clergy have claimed to be the chief ones on the earth of God’s organization. Having turned entirely unto religion, they are sinners, and to them Jehovah says: “The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites; Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?” (Isa. 33:14) Those religionists now hear the sounding of the doom of religion, and they are frightened and continue to howl.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>26</sup> There is a possible remedy that might be applied by the individuals of “Christendom”, but the religious leaders make no effort to avail themselves of such remedy. God knows that they will not avail themselves of the remedy, but he tells them about it, that they may have no excuse to say that they did not know. Therefore the Lord says to the religionists, who claim to represent him: “Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly; gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord.”—Joel 1:14.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>2T</sup> If the clergy should obey God’s command and indulge in the fasts commanded, of necessity they must cease their religious practices and observances in which they have been indulging in order to appear respectable to the world. The real fasting which God has commanded would bring upon the clergy the reproach of Satan and his agents. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy never indulge in the fasts commanded by the Lord, because they make up the chief ones of Satan’s representatives on the earth. They do indulge in an outward show of fasts, and they do lament and howl for the effect they hope the same will have upon the public, but such is not the fast which God calls upon them to sanctify. The fast in which the religionists indulge is hypocritical, because they make an outward show hoping to influence the people; and concerning such the Lord says: “Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen! a day for a man to afflict his soul ? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord ?” —Isa. 58:4,5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’’The religious leaders in the days when Jesus was first on earth indulged in such hypocritical fasts, and, addressing his disciples, Jesus said: “Moreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.”—Matt. 6:16-18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>19</sup> In the prophecy of Joel the Lord is telling the religionists to fast or refrain from the food they have been using to hoodwink the people, namely, religious doctrines and practices. They have had nothing to feed upon but religious food, and such food they have served to the supporters of religion, which is of no value; and God’s command is that their ministers and the people refrain from such religious food. Their fast should be similar to that in which the people of good will at Nineveh indulged upon hearing of God’s judgment. (Jonah 3:5) No one is commanded to fast from the truth. It is the truth of God’s Word that he brings to the people and invites them to feed upon it and live. Religionists do not have the truth, but they have substituted for truth the doctrines of men. Now the Lord tells them to cease from such and turn to the truth and feed upon what God has provided. Those who are amongst the religionists who would find relief must obey this command and fast from what the religious leaders have been serving them. To obey that command of Jehovah would put such in the class with Christ Jesus, and upon them would fall reproach like that which fell upon the Lord. (Rom. 15:3) The clergy steer clear of all things of that kind. The honest ones amongst the religionists are anxious to obey the Lord, and they do so, and they find relief, protection and blessings under the Lord’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>80</sup> Further instructing them, Jehovah says: “Call a solemn assembly [a day of restraint </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)]” </span><span class="font8">On the day following the end of the “feast of tabernacles” the faithful Israelites did call a solemn assembly. (Num. 29:35) It was then a time of restraint from doing servile work, serving creatures, or indulging in activities for self-gain. Instead of seeking and serving selfish things, they must assemble and seek God at his temple. Today the kingdom interests must be uppermost in the mind and heart of those who attend such solemn assemblies, otherwise called the “day of restraint”. “Christendom,” that is, those who practice what is called the “Christian religion”, would not call such assembly the “day of restraint”, because to do so they would have to abandon all their religious ceremonies and political affiliations and activities, all of which things are selfish and used for self-gain. It would mean that all “Catholic Action” would have to cease and be completely abandoned; and the Hierarchy would never agree to that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>81</sup> Further admonishing the religionists, Jehovah says to them: “Gather the elders [the old men </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.); </span><span class="font8">that is to say, the dreamers mentioned in Joel 2: 28].” They too need to engage in such a fast or day of restraint. They must cease their religious dreams and speculations and guesses and turn wholly to the truth of God’s kingdom. They have much responsibility as examples to the younger ones. This applies to the “elective elder” class of the present day. Let all who continue to hold to religious practices, which were indulged in during the “Elijah period”, cease from the same, turn away therefrom and give full attention to the service and the interest of the kingdom of God. This admonition includes “all the inhabitants of the land”, that is, all who have made a covenant to do the will of God. Religionists, if they would heed the admonition, must cease from making the professed house of God a “den” of commercial grafters (Jer. 7:11), and must face about and “serve God and his King”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>82</sup> There is a two-fold purpose in God’s placing upon the religionists and those under the religious leaders the responsibility to call a day of fasting or restraint, to wit: (1) To give warning to all who indulge in religion, and (2) to disclose the only means of escape from Satan’s organization, which God provides for those who are of good will toward him. There are those amongst the religious leaders and under their influence who sigh and cry because of the abominations done in “Christendom”, and such persons must have an opportunity to hear and learn what is the way of escape and where they may find safety. Therefore God commands that “all the inhabitants” assemble at the house of the Lord and “cry unto the Lord”. (Joel 1:14) By so doing they acknowledge their guilt in having followed and practiced religion and its traditions rather than hearing and obeying the Word of God and worshiping him in spirit and in truth. They must recognize that the judgment now proclaimed is not the judgment of Joel the prophet nor of any man nor of the witnesses of the Lord, but that it is God’s judgment and his expression of condemnation of religious practices. They must call upon the name of the Lord for mercy and express their determination to serve him and keep his commandments to promote the interests of the kingdom. They must seek righteousness and meekness and become obedient. (Zeph. 2:3) When must this be done? Now, at the present time, before Armageddon begins. It will be too late to cry unto the Lord when Armageddon begins. When the battle of Armageddon is on, “then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof; therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.”—Prov. 1: 28-31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>88</sup> For several centuries Satan has carried on his religious and other operations without interruption; but the end of such time must come, and did come when Jehovah enthroned Christ Jesus and sent him forth to rule while the enemy Satan is still active. (Ps. 110: 2) Therefore the Lord by his prophet says: &quot;Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.” (Joel 1:15) The day of Jehovah began in A.D. 1914. Satan has had his day, and he must now get out. The war in heaven was fought, and Satan was cast down to the earth. (Rev. 12:1-9) Then in 1918 judgment began at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) The day of tribulation God then stopped for a season in order that the witness work might be done. This he did for the benefit of those who loved God and his kingdom and that the Lord’s “other sheep” might be gathered. (Matt. 24: 22) Since that day is the time in which God is doing his “strange work”. This is the time when God causes his adverse judgment against Satan’s organization to be made known, serving warning upon all and disclosing to those of good will the only means of escape from destruction which soon shall follow. In this day of his “strange work” Jehovah sends his army of ‘locusts”, which constitutes a plague upon “Christendom”, and the heat is turned on against religion. (Joel 1:4,10,12) This is a warning that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is close by. The wrath of God does not stop with the locust plague and the rainless season of famine in “Christendom”, but reaches a climax at Armageddon. Now is the time of the ‘destroying pests’ upon “Christendom” or religion. Hence the plague is not from men. It is not another religious campaign of men or a propaganda movement such as the atheists, Bolsheviks and Communists, and other godless radicals, carry on. It is from Almighty God, who now sends forth his servants and messengers to declare his name and his purpose, and which he commands must be done immediately preceding the battle of Armageddon.—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>84</sup> There is no scarcity of spiritual food in God’s storehouse, but the famine is all on “Christendom”, and that famine is for the hearing of the Word of God and is due to the fact that God has closed the door to “Christendom”. “Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?” (Joel 1:16) The religious leaders know that God has forsaken them. This text, according to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font8"> makes it clear and shows the religious leaders as saying: “Is it not before our eyes that food hath been cut off?” Jehovah’s wrath is toward “Christendom”, exactly as God declared both to typical and to antitypical Jerusalem by the mouth of Moses. “But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.” (Deut. 28:15) There is an abundance of spiritual food being scattered throughout the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses, and it comes from God’s storehouse, but “Christendom” has no access to and no part in the distribution thereof. Neither the Roman Catholic clergy nor other religious leaders or “evil servant” class have anything to do with dispensing the spiritual food of the Lord. None of them are for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and hence they are against the kingdom. All food from the Lord’s storehouse that is carried to the people is being carried by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, and all of these together are acting through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> organization. The religionists of “Christendom” see this fact and desperately attempt to prevent Jehovah’s servants from carrying the spiritual food to the common and hungry people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>35</sup> In recent months God has clearly revealed to his faithful servants the distinction between the so-called “Christian religion” and Christianity, the truth of and concerning which exposes to plain view the emptiness of the religious systems, showing the people that they can get from religion nothing that is helpful, but only that which is detrimental, and that their only help comes from following and obeying Christ Jesus, hence being real Christians. The book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font8"> contains the truth concerning religion and Christianity, and within a short time after it was released the circulation thereof reached more than two million volumes, and the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, </span><span class="font8">which contains a succinct statement of the falsity of religion and what is Christianity, within a few months actually had a circulation of more than twelve million amongst the people. This work the Lord fitly illustrates by the plague of the locusts eating up what little had been left in “Christendom”. The “purgatory” racket, which has for a long time been a source of much revenue to the Hierarchy, is now completely exposed as the greatest money-inak-ing racket that has ever operated; and this greatly frightens and makes mad the clergy. Their own publications give forth more evidence of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>88</sup> The “strange work” of Jehovah, which he has done and is doing by his faithful servants, by his army of “locusts”, has taken the joy and gladness from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, whose god is Satan. Hence they say: “Yea, joy and gladness [are cut off] from the house of our God.” That house which once loudly claimed to be distributing spiritual provender has now become the house of commercial and political robbers. Such well describes Catholic Action, and therefore says a one-time Jesuit clergyman in his book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer: </span><span class="font8">“Catholicism is now something that partakes of clannishness and that is constituted in a large part by social and political club affiliation. Catholic action in practice is the Catholic group fighting their way to control America”; politically and financially, of course. No religious leader believes, and hence none teaches, that Christ Jesus has come to the temple of God, and they therefore have no understanding or appreciation that the kingdom of Christ is here. As it was with the religious Jews, so it is now with &quot;Christendom”, to whom the Lord says: “Your house [of religion] is left unto you desolate.”—Matt. 23: 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8T</sup> The spiritual crops of “Christendom” have completely failed: “The seed is rotten [the seeds rot (R.F.)] under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.” (Joel 1:17) There is a complete absence of and prospect for a new crop. God has now made it clearly to appear that nothing good can spring from religion. The seeds of religion now rot because sown at the instance of the Devil, and his day is done. The people can gain nothing from religion. All the people of good will toward God now realize this fact and flee from the religious systems and seek protection in Christ. The great heat from the truth turned on by the Lord, and the complete absence of the rain of truth upon “Christendom”, have turned her barns into useless things, and there is no food supply to put in them, and none to take from them, for the people. The religionists do not appreciate the true state of affairs. Those who are honest among them do appreciate the true situation, and they sigh and cry because of the abominations which are done in “Christendom”, and the Lord hears their cry and sends them spiritual food through his faithful servants.—Ezek. 9:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>S8</sup> The credulous common people have been the beasts of burden for the clergy and other religious leaders, political and commercial, and these now seeing the desolate condition are much perplexed and in distress. “How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.” (Joel 1:18) The entire system of religion is doomed and headed for early destruction. The very opposite state or condition exists amongst the people of God, who are described by the Lord in these words: “Jerusalem [those who are of God’s organization and who follow peace and serve G od and his King] shall be inhabited as towns without walls [needing no protection] for the multitude of men and cattle therein.”—Zech. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>89</sup> By his prophet Jehovah tells the people what they should do, but the religious leaders refuse to hear. Those who are of good will, and who are getting their eyes opened to the truth, are shown by the prophet as using these words: “0 Lord, to thee will I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.” (Joel 1:19) Instead of the religious clergy leaders’ joining with the common people of good will in this crying unto the Lord, they continue to call down God’s blessing upon the political and commercial schemes of the world and at the same time try to destroy those who do bring God’s message of good cheer to the hungry ones. The man recently elevated to the post of pope of the Hierarchy calls for his blessing upon the United States, and, of course, this is done for political effect. The pope’s blessing has already been bestowed upon the murderer who has destroyed Spain and Abyssinia and wrecked many other people’s homes in different parts of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>40</sup> Continuing to disclose the miserable condition that has been brought about amongst the people of the religious agents of Satan, God, through his prophet, says: “The beasts of the field cry also unto thee; for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.” —Joel 1:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>41</sup> The religious leaders have made life miserable for the common people, who are really the ‘beasts of burden’, and whom the Hierarchy calls “the children of the church”. Jehovah now makes it clearly to appear that religion, which is of the Devil, is responsible for the famine conditions in “Christendom” for the hearing of the Word of God. Organized religion is the enemy of God, and the destructive foe of the people. Upon the religious systems and religious practice God sends no more rain, that is, no more blessings. Religious systems are marked and branded for destruction, which only waits until the witness work, God’s “strange work”, is finished. The alarm of warning must be sounded now, to the end that none of the religious practitioners may say that they did not hear about the kingdom, and, furthermore, that those amongst the religious systems that are of good will may find a way to flee. This is the work which God long ago foretold, and which is a &quot;strange work” to all who do not have the spirit of the Lord. It is the work of Jehovah, in which he uses the remnant of his people and their companions, and both of these must now give close attention to God’s commandments and strictly obey. The faithful, anointed remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord greatly rejoice, because they see that the kingdom of God under Christ is at hand and that complete deliverance is near. Let all such continue to diligently hear and obey the Lord’s commandments and learn of his purpose and what is their daily duty.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark27"></a>FOURTH</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font6">N THE visions of the revelation given to the apostle John on the prison isle of Patmos in the Aegean sea, he saw “seven angels which stood before God” and to whom were given “seven trumpets”. Manifestly these seven angels picture spirit creatures clothed with authority to perform certain duties in Jehovah’s organization. These are designated as seven in number because seven is the number symbolic of perfection or completeness in things spiritual. Even so these angels were used to deliver all of the seven distinct proclamations, which proclamations were made world-wide, one each year from A.D. 1922 on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1918 Christ Jesus, the King greater than Solomon, began to build the temple of Jehovah God. Of this temple each member of the body of Christ forms a “living stone”. Seven years have now passed. It is A.D. 1925. Jehovah continuing to direct the movement of his organiza</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tion, </span><span class="font6">the fourth angel of the Lord sounds his trumpet, and, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">Revelation 8:12 records, “the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.” Even so, the “third part” of the following group composed of (1) Big Business, symbolized by the golden &quot;sun” of prosperity; (2) the so-called “statesmen” or lawmaking element, symbolized by the moon; and (3) the fraudulent clergy, symbolized by the stars, claimed to be the light of the world, and they have falsely used the slogan: “Make the world safe for democracy,” and they say concerning the League of Nations: “In a world as dark as this why blow out the only light there is ?” They hold forth themselves and their schemes as the saviors of men. Their glory must be broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God directed his angel, the fourth, to sound, and directed his people on earth, as his witnesses and members of his capital organization, to take up the message sounded and herald it on. In August, 1925, at a general convention of God’s people assembled in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">resolution “Message of Hope” was unanimously adopted by Jehovah’s witnesses, which, together with the discourse in support thereof, to wit, “A Standard for the People,” was heralded by word of mouth and by radio and by the printed copies to millions of people throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1925 is a parallel of the year 1028 B.C., when King Solomon, after seven years of work on the temple,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark29"></a>TRUMPET</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">dedicated it and then in his public prayer to God included a petition in behalf of the “stranger that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake; for they shall hear of thy great name”. (1 Ki. 8:41,42) In parallel action, the world-wide proclamation of A.D. 1925 was a message of hope addressed to the people of good will, the “great multitude” out of all nations and people, the Lord’s “other sheep”, and who were foreshadowed by the “stranger that is within thy gates”.—Ex. 20:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“MESSAGE OF HOPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To All People of Good Will:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The International Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] in general convention assembled send greetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When in the course of human affairs the nations have reached a condition of extremity it is due time that the peoples give consideration to the inducing causes, to the proffered remedies and to the true remedy. We humbly invite consideration of this message to the end that the peoples might find consolation therein and hope for their future welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For centuries man has been the victim of oppression, war, famine, sickness, sorrow and death. At all times he has desired peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“World powers, science and philosophy, commerce and religion, have each in turn offered their respective remedies for man’s relief. In the name and under the guise of democracy, these combine in offering their joint and several powers to meet the requirements of man. Together they claim to be the sunlight of the world, holding forth all the light that shines to enlighten and guide the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Intrigue, duplicity and trickery are freely resorted to by the political and commercial powers; science and philosophy are marked by vanity and self-sufficiency; while the religionists, both Catholic and Protestant, are conspicuous by their arrogance, self-conceit, impiety and ungodliness. Therefore it is apparent that the remedies offered by any and all of these afore-mentioned elements are vain, impotent and powerless to satisfy man’s desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Catholicism claims and assumes that which justly belongs exclusively to God. Modernists deny God, deny his Word and his purpose of redemption and offer blind force as a remedy for man’s undone condition. Fundamentalists, while professing to believe the Bible, by their course of action deny the same. They teach false and God-dishonoring doctrines and together with Catholics and Modernists are allied with the political and commercial powers of the world in blasphemously claiming the ability to establish God’s kingdom on earth. All of these have combined, under Satan their superlord, to push God into a corner and to dishonor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The results are that the peoples are smarting under the oppressive weight of commercial profiteers and their allies, have lost faith in their political leaders and no longer have respect for the religionists who have misled them. Being guided by the false light of such an ungodly and unholy alliance, the peoples have fallen into darkness. They are like lost sheep scattered upon the mountain tops without a shepherd and are without food and shelter and are made the prey of wild beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The causes for this deplorable condition are that man by reason of original sin fell from perfection; and that Satan the enemy of God and all righteousness is the invisible ruler or god of this evil world and by his various agencies has turned the minds of many peoples away from God and from his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The greatest crisis of the ages is impending and about to fall, because the old world has ended and Satan’s lease of power is done. Knowing this, and that his time is short, the Devil is trying to overwhelm the peoples with a great flood of false and deceptive doctrines and to turn their minds completely away from Jehovah. The time has come for God to make for himself a name in the earth and for the peoples to know the truth concerning the divine purpose, which is the only means of salvation for the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Therefore, in the name and in the spirit of the Lord, the standard of God’s truth and righteousness is here lifted up against the enemy and for the benefit of the peoples, which standard is, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That Jehovah is the only true God, the Most High, the Almighty, the author and finisher of his great purpose for the salvation of man, and is the rewarder of all that diligently seek and obey him; that the Bible is his revealed &quot;Word of truth; that his beloved Son Christ Jesus is the Redeemer and Deliverer of mankind and, true to his promise, has come to rule and bless the peoples; that the present turmoil, distress and perplexity of the nations is in fulfillment of prophecy, proving that Satan’s empire must fall soon and that the Lord of righteousness is taking possession ; that the Lord Jesus is now establishing his righteous government and will sweep away Satan’s stronghold of lies, lead the peoples into the true light and judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with his truth; and that his kingdom of righteousness is the only remedy for the ills of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We confidently appeal to the peoples to rally to the divine standard of truth thus lifted up and thereby learn the way that leads to life and happiness. We call upon all the people of good will of every nation, kindred and tongue, to discard the errors invented by the enemy Satan and for many years taught by man, and to receive and believe the divine purpose for salvation as set forth in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“God’s kingdom for which the peoples have long prayed is at hand. It alone can and will establish and stabilize the world so that it cannot be moved. Its ensign of righteousness is the standard now lifted up for the people. Christ Jesus as glorified King and great executive officer of Jehovah God, has become the rightful Ruler of the world. Let the peoples receive, believe and obey him and his laws of righteousness. All who so do are certain to receive the blessings of peace, prosperity, health, life, liberty and eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Dated Indianapolis, Aug. 29, 1925.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That message exposed the intrigue, duplicity and trickery of the ruling group. When it fell upon their ears it cast a gloom on the brightness of their light. Their father and leader Satan, and his schemes, and their own schemes, were exposed to the gaze of the people, which dimmed the brilliancy of the enemy’s organization. The message pointed out that the cause of the distress and suffering among the peoples of earth is due to Satan and his selfish agencies. In striking contrast it held forth God’s standard for the people, pointing them to the divine standard as the only hope of salvation and telling them that God’s kingdom and his anointed King has come and is marching majestically on to the complete destruction of Satan’s organization. It was a message of gloom to the enemy’s organization. It was a message of hope and joy to those who have faith in God. It was a part of God’s ever-increasing light to those who love him. As foretold in Isaiah 30:26 concerning God’s faithful witnesses on earth: “Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound [received during the World War period].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the 31st of October, 1925, or in the same Jewish month of the year that King Solomon completed the building of the temple for Jehovah’s name at Jerusalem, there began a world-wide distribution of the above Resolution “Message of Hope” and its supporting argument, and millions of copies in many languages were put in the hands of the people; and this had the effect of darkening the schemes of the worldly organizations, to the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the vision the apostle John (picturing Jehovah’s faithful servant class on earth) next beheld, and heard an “angel” flying in the midst of heaven. A number of Bible versions render this word of the Greek manuscript as “eagle” instead of “angel”. (See the versions of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham, Emphatic Diaglott, American Revised Version.)</span><span class="font6"> The eagle is far-visioned. (Job 39:29) It symbolizes the servants of the Lord who are privileged to have some far vision of what the Lord is about to do. It was believed that Jehovah had provided the radio to proclaim his message of truth. Amidst much tribulation, which was to be expected, the radio station WBBR was built and put in operation in 1924, and at least five other radio stations were then broadcasting the truth. The 1925 resolution known as the “Message of Hope”, and the accompanying discourse, “A Standard for the People,” was broadcast throughout America and Canada on radio stations, “through the midst of heaven,” as well as in other forms mentioned.—Rev. 8:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apocalyptic vision says that the eagle “flying through the midst of heaven” is heard to say: “Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which arc yet to sound.” (Rev. 8:13) It was in that same year, 1925, that God’s people saw clearly that the battle of Armageddon would be the battle of God against Satan, and not a melee between contending forces of mankind. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> January 1, 1925.) It was seen that there remained much work to be done to give the witness before the great and terrible day when Jehovah’s forces shall completely triumph. This farsightedness of God’s people is illustrated by the eagle. God’s devoted people, therefore, with eagle-vision, have gone forward with the work in proclaiming the vengeance of God against Satan’s organization, which is a “woe” to those composing the organization. The clear implication from this statement must be that the “voices of the trumpet of the three angels” yet to sound would announce God’s vengeance upon Satan’s organization and assign the reason therefor. And the three “trumpet” proclamations that followed in the next three years did that very thing.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark31"></a>THINGS REQUIRED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH delivered a remnant of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon and restored them to the land of Judah and Jerusalem, which had lain desolate without man or beast for seventy years. Through fear of the enemy and the religiousness on the part of some that remnant permitted themselves to be held up for sixteen years with respect to rebuilding the temple of Jehovah God at Jerusalem. Then Jehovah raised up his faithful prophet Zechariah to encourage the remnant in the completing of the temple building. Now, since A.D. 1919, Jehovah God has restored the faithful remnant of his witnesses on earth from a like captivity in the Devil’s organization foreshadowed by Babylon. Christ Jesus, the chief corner stone of the building, proceeds to the building of the great spiritual temple wherein Jehovah dwells by his spirit, and the great Builder gathers unto himself at the temple the faithful remnant, cleanses them and sets them to offering a praise offering in righteousness unto Jehovah God.—Hal. 3:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the remnant would remain in the temple and par</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">take </span><span class="font6">of the good things which Jehovah prepares at this time, they must do what he commands them. Zechariah 8:16 reads: “These are the things that ye shall do: Speak </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ye </span><span class="font6">every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.” This commandment of the Lord cannot be fulfilled by making speeches before the people of God concerning “character development”, so called, or any other kind of speeches that merely sound nice. The speakers on any occasion in God’s service must speak the truth, and it is not true that man by his own efforts can prepare himself and make himself fit for the kingdom of heaven; nor by amusing or entertaining his hearers by his speech can he accomplish God’s purposes. He must obey the Lord God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been brought to the point of unity in God’s organization each one must speak the kingdom message of truth which the Lord has provided. Ephesians 4:24, 25 bears this out, saying: “Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness [(marginal reading says:) holiness of truth; that is, the truth alone]. Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.” The remnant, now engaged in the work foreshadowed by the work of the prophet Elisha, must speak up-to-date truth, and not what was learned during the Elijah period of the church, before 1918. They must be frank to point out the true qualifications of a follower of Christ, his commission to service, and his responsibility, speaking </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">truth of and concerning the kingdom and plainly tell</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">the truth concerning the enemy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">God commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who refuse to obey Jehovah’s great Prophet Christ Jesus in this and in other matters of importance shall be destroyed, as Acts 3: 22, 23 plainly declares. Hypocrisy will no longer be tolerated. The truth concerning Jehovah’s judgment of his people and against “Christendom” and all the enemy’s organization must be told. Avoid all controversy, but be diligent in telling the truth; as it is written: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.” (Ps. 122: 6, 9) “But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.” (Gal. 5:15) The faithful remnant will keep the unity in Christ and go forward joyfully in the army of the Lord God. (Eph. 4:13; Phil. 1:27) Unfaithfulness to the Lord’s organization is hateful to Jehovah. (Isa. 58:1) Each member thereof is responsible to the Lord and must put self in the background and give strict heed and attention to the interests of the kingdom. Zechariah 8:17 adds: “And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these things are things that I hate, saith the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah was there stating the divine requirements to a delegation of men from the city of Bethel, of the weeping kind, “old-timers,” sticklers for religious formalities, unprogressive, and who made a show of fasting in commemoration of the months of the year when national calamity and destruction came upon the land of Judah and Jerusalem. (Zech. 7:1-3) Jehovah now gives answer to their question about the suitableness of fasts since their deliverance from captivity in Babylon and beginning the rebuilding of God’s temple at Jerusalem. The fast they celebrated in the fourth month commemorated the fall of Jerusalem and the capture of the king, Zedekiah. (2 Ki. 25:3-5) The fast of the fifth month commemorated the destruction of the temple built by Solomon; the fast of the seventh month commemorated the time of the complete desolation of the land without man or beast (2 Ki. 25: 8, 9, 25, 26) ; and the fast of the tenth month commemorated the time when the prophet Ezekiel, captive in Babylon, received the news that the city of Jerusalem had been smitten. (Ezck. 33:21) Concerning this practice, which was unfitting now, Jehovah said: ‘This shall not be a time of weeping now, but shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts,’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> “pleasant appointed meetings.” Therefore Zechariah (8:19) says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts: therefore love the truth and peace.” When the trouble, such as persecution, imprisonment, public misrepresentation, etc., came upon God’s covenant people in 1917 and 1918, they should have received it with joy, accepting it as being permitted by Jehovah that his purposes might be accomplished. Certainly after 1919 those who love the Lord and his truth should no longer mourn about what had come to pass. Those who do are, as Hebrews 6:1 says, “laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works” and do not “go on unto perfection”. Instead of obeying the Lord and walking on joyfully in the light he has given to his people, many “weepers” have continued to observe days and months and times and years, and to hold solemn and weepy meetings to commemorate the death of one who in the past led them, and on such occasions to pray: “God bless his memory.” They also have tried to perpetuate a now dead form of work, the “Elijah work”, also the symbolic meanings formerly attached to the dead stones of the great pyramid at Gizeh, Egypt, and such things, all of which is displeasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time having arrived, the temple work must be done, and it is time to be “forgetting those things which are behind” and with joy reach out and do the work which Jehovah has commanded must be done looking to the vindication of his name. The Lord says: “Therefore love the truth and peace.” That means unity and peace in doing God’s will, and not peace that comes by compromise with the enemy of God and his people. (Heb. 12:14) The true and faithful ones have responded to the Lord’s commandment. The large and small “service conventions” which they have been holding, the world-wide “united testimony periods”, the campaigns carried forward to the honor of Jehovah and to his praise, and this in the face of stubborn resistance by the enemy of the truth in various parts of the earth, all these are proof of their faithful devotion to Jehovah. This obedience they have rendered with joy and in great peace. These have been no “weep fest” occasions. The remnant are rejoicing in the truth that Jehovah continues to provide for them and which he has given them, particularly since the year 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s promise given through Zechariah is that many who have been under Satan’s organization will come and seek the truth at the hands of the Lord’s representatives: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts; It shall yet come to pass that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities.” (Zech. 8:20) God’s capital organization Zion, the new Jerusalem, shall become a house of prayer for all nations or people who ever get life. (Isa. 56:7) The truth must reach the ears of many people, that they may identify themselves as on the Lord’s side, and this must be done before the battle of Armageddon; and this was foreshadowed by Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple concerning the coming thereto of strangers from afar. (1 Ki. 8:41-43) The text'of Zechariah 8:21,22 shows that many people shall come to a knowledge of the truth and will tell others about it. The “great multitude” class foreshadowed by King Jehu’s chariot companion, Jonadab, is now hearing and saying, in the language of the prophet, “I will go also” and tell others about the kingdom, not out of envy or strife, but of good will to help others. (Phil. 1:15-17) This part of the prophecy of Zechariah shows that many people of different nationalities, such as the Japanese, Chinese, East Indians and others, will hear this gospel of the kingdom. The facts show that this part of the prophecy is now in course of fulfillment. The kingdom message is now printed in more than 80 languages, and there are witnesses to Jehovah and his kingdom in 78 countries of the earth. Those who hear and accept the truth will no longer pray unto priests, preachers and rabbis, but will seek the truth at the temple of Jehovah. This is now in process of fulfillment, as foretold also at Isaiah 2:3 and Micah 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number “ten” symbolically represents completeness of things pertaining to the earth, or, all things, and in this manner it is used in the following prophecy of Zechariah 8:23: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold on the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.” The time, “those days,” has now begun; and “all languages” means all of those people who constitute the Jonadab class, regardless of nationality, and these are beginning to seek the kingdom truth. (2 Ki. 10:15-23 ; Ps. 68: 31; Isa. 55: 5, 6) The skirt of the garment hangs down at the feet, and hence the language of the prophecy, “ten men . . . shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,” necessarily means taking hold on those who constitute “the feet” of the body of Christ, the One who gives “praise” and vindication to Jehovah’s name, because “praise” is the meaning of the name “Jew” or “Judah”. Christ Jesus is “The Lion of the tribe of Juda” and the King to all that praise Jehovah’s name. (Rev. 5:5) His faithful followers on earth are his feet members, the remnant, who now bring good news of the kingdom and sing the praises of Jehovah. —Isa. 52:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unfaithful whom Christ Jesus classified as the “evil servant” class say, “We are Jews”; but the Lord says they are members of Satan’s organization; and He knows. (Rev. 3:9; 2:9) Jehovah has put his name upon his anointed ones, and therefore the “ten men” who take hold on them means all persons of earth who honestly seek the truth and who will not be misled in determining who is “The Jew”. They will know it is Christ, that is, Christ Jesus and his anointed body members. (Isa. 62:2; 65:15; Rev. 2:17) These persons of good will are now saying to the feet members of Christ, the “Jew”, in the language of the prophecy: ‘We are with you’; meaning we are supporting Jehovah’s witnesses and we arc for the kingdom. Today Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to his commandments, are taking the lead, and the Jonadab class follow and are thus getting into the Lord’s “chariot” or organization, as Jonadab got into Jehu’s chariot. (Isa. 62:10; 57:13,14; see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font6"> Book Three, page 29) The faithful remnant render themselves in full obedience to Jehovah’s commandment and his organization instructions, and he is pleased to use them in the temple service and to continue to prepare them for Armageddon, which is just ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AT THE LONDON (ENG.) ZONE ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The lengthy article in the March 17 issue of the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font6"> entitled ‘Judge Rutherford Starts Big Drive against Religion in England’ was read. It brought many laughs from the Kingdom publishers in the course of the reading and increased their determination to continue forward in the campaign against the Catholic-Fascist crowd in spite of their threats and assaults, having Jehovah’s assurance: ‘But they shall not prevail against thee.’ For their tea the publishers crowded out the many restaurants and cafes near Kingdom Hall. A lively discussion of this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font6"> article at one table was overheard by a stranger near by. After a few minutes she came over and interrupted, saying she also had read that article and even though she was a Catholic she wished more information. Not much time lost giving it, also an invitation to return with the publishers to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study, which she gladly accepted. She was keenly interested and thrilled with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study and is making plans to further step along in the way of the Kingdom rather than that of Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;This exposure of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font6"> has sharpened the interest of the people, making them come out into the open and take their stand for the Kingdom and against the Hierarchy. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> has now published more than ten articles about Jehovah’s witnesses since its first ‘slip’ in printing its lying report of October 14, and each time it has put its foot into it and caused more people to inquire concerning the Kingdom. The Society’s London office has received hundreds of letters and requests for further information as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM PIONEER HOME NO. 1 IN NORTH LONDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;We received from the London office a request from an interested lady to pay her a visit and play ‘Faee the Facts’. This as a result of her reading a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald </span><span class="font6">leaflet exposing the crookedness of these religionists. We played her all the lecture, and the lady took the special offer for 6/- (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> year’s subscription, book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font6">and booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts),</span><span class="font6"> and additionally some </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> booklets to distribute herself. She was glad there was someone to so fearlessly expose the Hierarchy. Tears came to her eyes at the part of the lecture where Judge Rutherford says: ‘We meet you on the battlefield with songs of praise to Jehovah’s name on our lips.’ Her husband was Spanish, so she, now a widow, has lived in Spain and said no one need tell her of the doings of the priests and how they got hold of the children before seven years of age. At her home there is a Spanish boy who is trying to learn to read the Bible so that he will know what to believe. We arc making arrangements to leave with him some Spanish literature. Next week we are to pay a further visit to play the ‘Fascism or Freedom’ recordings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A ZONE SERVANT IN OREGON REPORTS:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;I have been using the ‘doorstep set-up’ method during March and had as many phonograph setups as the four previous months. By using this method I got in two or three times as many homes as before. I am urging all the publishers to use it. Those who have been report good results, finding it easier to interest the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AMONG CATHOLIC POPULATION IN GLASGOW, SCOTLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“A man who said he was on parish relief showed good interest, and accordingly I arranged a back-call. The recorded lecture I took was ‘Safety’. I ran the series right through, his wife, daughter and he listening very attentively. When it was over he exclaimed: ‘I could go on listening to that man all night; I always go and hear him in Glasgow, whenever he’s here. When is he coming again?’ After some conversation I reintroduced </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> a sample of which he had previously taken on my first call. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> attracted him very much, and, while quite willing to take each issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> as it came out, in order to get </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font6">free he is going to put a sixpence away every week till April and take out a subscription. His concluding remarks were: ‘Ye knows there’s as many Catholics go to hear Judge Rutherford as Protestants. I’m a Catholic masel!’ I don’t think he’s going to be a Catholic much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESS IN THE IRISH FREE STATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;In Dublin we called at a house and asked the man who opened the door if there were any Protestant families in the street, as we had a phonograph we wanted to take to them. He showing himself to be a person of good will, I mentioned that the records dealt with divine prophecy. He at once asked us in, saying that the ‘Holy Marys’ were at mass and we had come just at the right time. He was Catholic, the ‘Holy Marys’ being his wife and daughters. He heard the recordings ‘Relief’ and ‘Resolution’, took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font6"> and thanked us for calling. A Catholic lady told me she had no objection to my coming to give lectures in her home, her husband being a Protestant, but she would go to the Cinema on my back-ealls, as she was forbidden to listen. While playing the record ‘Relief’ in a home, a young man entered and listened attentively, afterwards manifesting his enthusiasm in no uncertain terms. He was delighted to take </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> to learn more, as he had never heard anything like it. When he had gone the householder was astonished at his enthusiasm, because the visitor was a Catholic. An interested person here is feeding the butcher boy, baker boy, and various others with the literature, all Roman Catholics whom we could not reach. Another interesting experience: A pioneer has placed 120 books in 16 days, mostly on her back-calls. A Roman Catholic, blind man, in one of the poor tenement houses hears the records with a lit-up countenance. He is married to a Protestant whose friends warned me he was a very wicked man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WAY HE GOT IN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘“Come back in a half-hour or so!’ Next: ‘Come some other time!’ The publisher replied he had a wonderful lecture he would like her to hear. She said: ‘No, no, you better come around some other day.’ He: ‘What seems to be the trouble?’ She: ‘Oh, we have a busted water spigot, and wc can’t seem to fix it.’ He: ‘I’ll fix it for you.’ She: ‘Well, if you think you can fix it, come right in.’ So the Kingdom publisher went in, threw off his coat and asked for tools, and the spigot was fixed in ten minutes. The job complete, the publisher looked at the lady and said: ‘How about listening to that lecture I was telling you about?’ She said: ‘All right, we’ll listen.’ ‘Fascism or Freedom’ was played, and everyone enjoyed it. Result: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscription, bound book and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> placed.”</span></p>

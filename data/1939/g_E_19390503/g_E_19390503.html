<p><span class="font4">An American, an Englishman and a Scotsman were invited to -a silver wedding. The first bought as a present a silver tea service for ten persons..The Englishman, wishing to go one better, bought a silver dinner service for twenty persons.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BETWEEN </span><span class="font4">the Transvaal and the Zambesi river lies the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia. Though not so wealthy as the Witwatersrand, it is nevertheless a very rich country. While some peo</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ple </span><span class="font4">have made fabulous sums, the great </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ma</span><span class="font4">jority are comfortably well off—very much' so, compared with other countries. The upper classes have built themselves beautiful residences staffed with plenty of native servants, whose labor is very cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Typically British, these people are slaves to convention. The great thing is to keep company with the ‘‘’right people”, patronize the “proper” institutions and do everything in the orthodox fashion. It is considered correct to support that which is British, but this particular form of patriotism frequently breaks down when any extra expense is involved. Unfortunately — for them —everything connected with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Society is </span><span class="font4">on the black list—it comes from America, it does not magnify the British Empire </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and it is </span><span class="font4">condemned by the “people that matter”. Few people realize what an effective and subtle form of censorship this convention really means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some Rhodesians would be quite as violently patriotic as the Nazis, if the law did not prevent it, and Jehovah’s witnesses are not the only people who get into trouble either. Recently Professor Gray, of the Witwatersrand University, gave a lecture in Bulawayo on Spain. He criticized the policy of the present British government towards Spain and argued that it wafi obeying the wishes of those capitalist interests which were everywhere trying to stem tl\e advance of movements likely to challenge the regime of private property. Immediately there was a storm of protest in the Press, of which the following letter by a member of Parliament was a masterpiece:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulawayo “Chronicle”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">17th September, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(To the Editor, Bulawayo </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sir,—I have just read your report of the lecture given at Bulawayo by Professor J. L. Gray, of Witwatersrand University. One would think that there was enough bilious criticism of Great Britain in the Union without the aid of an imported professor from the London School of Economics. But I cannot believe that any success he may have had with his denigration of the Mother country in the south will be repeated in Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is nothing new in the Professor’s theories. They are just a rehash of the half-baked pomposities of the “Nation” and the “News Chronicle,”. I dispute every one of his assumptions. In face of the overwhelming evidence of the frantic baboonery that passes for government in Barcelona, to talk of “going to the aid of democracy in Spain” is sheer drivel. If there is anyone left who can swallow that stuff, let. him read among dozens of similar unprejudiced, objective studies of the Spanish affair: “The Epic, of the Alcazar,” by Geoffrey Moss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY AND SANCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor is it anything but a vicious distortion of the facts to say that Britain “had not Opposed Italy because she was afraid that a social revolution in Italy would endanger the Imperialist investments of Great Britain”. What inhibited British action in the enforcement of effective sanctions against Italy was the discovery that, in spite of the pious phrases of the League, not a gun or a man would be moved by the other nations to Britain’s support, and that we alone would have to fight with an army and navy appallingly weakened by the Professor's Socialist friends and the rotting influence of the Left Wing generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Britain presents a humiliating spectacle.” Brit- ' ain’s conduct “has exposed her to the ridicule and anger of people of all nations”. Her “management of affairs” has “brought manv to regard her as a second-class timid power”. Uot all I know this bunkum is received with roars of applause in Pretoria. It won’t cut any ice in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have during the last seven years repeatedly visited countries of the North Bea and Me diter*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ranean Littoral. Early this year I travelled in Holland, Belgium, France, Germany and Austria. I am entirely certain that Great Britain’s prestige is as high as ever. For two reasons. First, the character of her leaders, and second, the growing strength of her armed forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And may heaven preserve her from ever falling under the dominion of the parlour Bolshies and pink intellectuals who have been harbingers of doom in so many of the other States of Europe. —I am, etc.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ L. M. Hastings. Machete, September 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is quoted to indicate the typical, intolerant disposition which is to be found among the higher-ups of Southern Rhodesia. Major Hastings was one of the gentlemen who voted in favor of the “Sedition Bill” in the Legislative Assembly two years ago. This Bill was admittedly designed to prevent the publications of the Wateh Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society from entering the Colony, but the courts later decided that this literature was not seditious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These 100-percent Britishers (or may we say 200-percent?) believe in freedom of speech —except for those who disagree with them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proportion of the common people is smaller in Southern Rhodesia than overseas. Wages are good and they don’t have to work nearly so hard as in Britain or even in the Union, for reasons which will presently be explained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The man who does most of the hard work is the native. His services are absolutely indispensable, yet his pay is very small—about £1 per month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Europeans like to live in Rhodesia. It is a land of glorious sunshine all the year round. As already mentioned, nearly everyone is comfortably well off and there are plenty of natives to do all the hard work. Life is very free and easy. Plenty of entertaining is done, especially by the well-to-do people, and plenty of alcoholic refreshment is consumed, though one seldom sees a European incapable in public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rhodesia is rich in minerals, of which gold is the chief. There are hundreds of small mines, many of them one-man enterprises. Rumors of war and increasing uncertainty send the price of gold soaring, because it is the one thing that any nation will accept at any time in exchange for the necessities of war. Gold is so unlike other commodities, the markets for which, sooner or later, get flooded, due to overproduction meantime (the world apparently can never have enough gold). Men go right into the bowels of the earth to find it and then it is stored in vaults most elaborately protected; and there it remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rearmament program is helping Rhodesia considerably. Asbestos is used in the construction of magazines for storing ammunition and for many other purposes. The asbestos mines are making large profits in the production of this curious substance. The copper mines of the North are very busy keeping the armament factories supplied, and their product commands an excellent price just now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another product of the Colony which brings considerable wealth to many is tobacco. It would appear that most of the exports of Rhodesia are used to mankind’s hurt rather than his good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Notorious “Watch Tower”<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark35">1</a></sup> ♦</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;"><img src="g_E_19390503_files/g_E_19390503-3.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:44pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Last year two of Jehovah’s witnesses from the Union of South Africa spent six months in the Colony. Their purpose was to advise the European population of the incoming Kingdom of Jehovah in order that those of good will might be sufficiently informed to take their stand on Jehovah’s side before He destroys all that is unrighteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As will be easy to understand, the ruling class was not at all keen about this message, but the common people were much more reasonable, though many of these .were badly misinformed concerning the intentions of Jehovah’s witnesses and the Society they represent—the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clergymen, missionaries, politicians, a number of the 100-percent Britishers, together with the Press, have succeeded in giving the Watch Tower a really shocking reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The popular view has been that the Wateh Tower is a sort of native communist-religious sect, backed by European agitators, out to eause trouble and generally against the government. A few influential businessmen have told the writer that their information is that an American Negro is at the head of the Watch Tower, while others have tales of American Negroes coming over to save their black brothers from the oppression of the white man— all under the direction of the Wateh Tower. The most fantastic stories circulate among responsible men, yet most of them admit that they are merely repeating what they have heard or read in the newspapers. Several highly-placed officials in the Native Affairs Department have admitted that any trouble among natives wdth a religious basis is almost sure to be labeled “Watch Tower”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole trouble is that the literature of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society points out that the missionaries and clergy are not what they profess to be, but are, in fact, frauds, and they are the source of the lying propaganda. This literature also has something to say of' conscienceless politicians and ultraselfish Big Business, and for that reason the “men that matter” in the Colony have no time whatever for Jehovah’s witnesses ; and the Press meekly follows on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Union of South Africa no one ever dreams of making such accusations against the Watch Tower; and in many parts conditions are similar to those in</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390503_files/g_E_19390503-4.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:122pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers in Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Rhodesia. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been intensively carried on among all sections of the population for many years, and no one dare make such accusations and expect to get away with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Native Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The African native is indispensable in the present economic structure of Southern Rhodesia and, indeed, of the surrounding territories as well. His labor is cheap, often, less than a shilling a day, plus food and sleeping quarters, and his needs are simple. For that he works long hours and does all the heavy work. Without cheap labor the gold, asbestos, copper and other mines would be unable to compete in the world markets and the farmer would be unable to do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For centuries the African native has led a care-free existence. His tribal customs and laws make an exceedingly interesting study, and some of these are definitely superior to our so-called “Christian” ways. Civilization has brought very mixed blessings to him, and no one can deny that both in morals and physique he has deteriorated. (But who cares in Rhodesia so long as eheap labor is available?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government levies a tax of £1 per year on every adult male native; and that forces the native to work, and thus industry is provided with labor. This money is used for financing native education, health clinics and other services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ninety-nine percent of the education is in the hands of missionaries, who receive a subsidy from the Government according to the number of pupils on their rolls and the standard of education of their teachers. This encourages competition for converts among the-various churches; and one Native Commissioner described it as like a scramble on the Stock Exchange. There arc nineteen churches in the field, but the Roman Catholics get as much as one-fifth of the subsidy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The education of the native is the Government’s responsibility, and it should not be handed over to competitive religionists, who, in any case, have handled the matter unwisely. With a sensible education in such things as cattle management, practical agriculture, woodwork, etc., excellent results can be and are obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many large employers of native labor are not in favor of native education; because immediately he begins to use his brains the native wants to get more of the good things of life and more money and more congenial work. That’s why native education is not good—it annoys Big Business, which thinks only in terms of cheap labor and good dividends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government does appear to bo making an effort to better the condition of the native, but it can go only as far as the European employers of labor will allow. There are also a number of fair-minded men who see the advantage to all concerned of the uplift and enlightenment of the native; but these arc ir the minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Victoria Falls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No remarks on Rhodesia would be complete without mention of the Victoria falls. Many have tried to describe the beauty and grandeur</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 3, 1939</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">this magnificent work of the Great Architect of the Universe. Human words are inadequate. The first man who saw this spectacle of wonder said, “Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in the flight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The falls are over a mile wide, and the Zambesi river thunders into a gorge 350 feet deep at the rate of a hundred million gallons </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">minute. The water then rushes along the bed of the gorge, converging on a very narrow outlet, whence it makes its way to the Indian ocean, nearly a thousand miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man could not have produced better facilities than nature has provided for the sightseer, for the level of the land, both above and below the falls, is the same; that is, the river falls into a tremendous gorge and one can look across this space in the earth to the lip of the falls. As a result of the terrific churning received by the water, clouds of spray rise far into the sky and'fall again as a perpetual rain. The reverential mind is filled with awe and delight on viewing this magnificent spectacle—far grander than the greatest show any man ever produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The governments of the two Rhodesias have made commendable efforts to keep the surroundings as far as possible in their natural state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The road and railway bridge passes over the narrow outlet just a few hundred yards from the falls. During the European crisis of September, 1938, this bridge was guarded by armed police. Officers with fixed bayonets went through each train and saw every passenger before it was allowed to proceed across the bridge. At night powerful searchlights played on the foundations and other vulner</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">able </span><span class="font4">parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apparently, information had reached the Government that, had hostilities broken out, it was the intention of Germans living in Northern Rhodesia to blow up the bridge and thus destroy the only connection between the greater part of Central Africa (including the Copper Mines} and Southern Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Communicat ions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The road system of Southern Rhodesia -is unique. With enormous mileage and a limited population the Roads Department has used its finances to the best advantage by providing just two parallel strips of tar macadam, placed so that the wheels of a ear can be conveniently kept on these strips. Sometimes one can drive for hours without meeting a ear. The law re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">quires th,at each motorist give way to the ex</span><span class="font4">tent of one strip to a passing driver, the other wheels running on the gravel. Separate </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">roads </span><span class="font4">are provided for animal-drawn traffic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A sweepstake is operated by the Government on all big horse races and fittracts considerable attention—and cash, most of which comes from the Union of South Africa, where lotteries are prohibited. Lotteries encourage the gambling spirit, which is degrading to a nation, but Rhodesians are unwilling to adequately finance their hospitals and charities otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Very superstitious, the native falls an easy victim to religionists, of whom many varieties operate in Southern Rhodesia. That confusion is the result, everyone' agrees, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">no one knows what to do about it. Both the missionaries and the Government agree that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses among the natives is undesirable, and it is not difficult to understand the view of either of these bodies. The Government has said that its action against the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society has been because of representations made to them by the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic institution is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">making </span><span class="font4">remarkable progress, and hopes one day to have sufficient influence among the natives to be able to dictate to the Government what is going to be done. Here is a really dangerous institution with a shocking record of bloodshed, torture, rioting, cruelty and inquisition, which is operating unhindered—indeed, as already mentioned, it is in receipt of a bigger Government subsidy than anyone else. Few people realize that the selfsame institution caused the recent rebellion against the proper government of Spain, and many other modern-day crimes too numerous to mention. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At the </span><span class="font4">same time a perfectly harmless organization, which stands for law and order and advises its hearers to wait for God’s kingdom as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">remedy for their grievances, is shockingly misrepresented and denied the privilege of sending a European representative to look </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">after</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the interests of the 400 to 500 native witnesses of Jehovah, who have suffered cruel persecutions from those who ought to know better and who will yet be ashamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were allowed entry into the Colony only on condition that we did not do any of our work among the natives, so that our activities were confined to Europeans. Every police station was advised of our presence, and our activities were under close observation. On several occasions people rang up the police to advise them of the presence of the “notorious” Watch Tower in the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">few, but only a few, of the businessmen were willing to state the reason for their opposition. The managing director of a wholesale warehouse truthfully said that the continued existence of the white man in Africa depended on his exploitation of the native. “For instance,” he said, “1 employ a number of Europeans and natives. The native labor costs £30 a month. If 1 could not obtain their cheap labor, then I would require to engage Europeans at a cost of £200 instead of £30 a month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These conditions applying to all the industries of the Colony would mean that everything would come to a standstill and the white man would have to depart from Rhodesia. If he is to remain, he must continue to exploit the native and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the native nwst not be allowed to know the extent to which his labor is being exploited.</span><span class="font4"> The gentleman already referred to strongly disapproved of our literature, because it tended to enlighten the native on the subject and thus jeopardize the white man’s very existence in Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the real truth of the situation, though few are sufficiently honest to admit it and many probably do not realize the issue so clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the clergy and the missionaries generally who drew the attention of the Government and the people to the great “danger” of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s work. It exposes their racket, too, of course, and, while feeling generally is strong against the missions, they have many people’s sympathy in opposing the Watch Tower. It is, of course, exceedingly convenient to have someone to blame for all the troubles among natives and for which troubles they themselves are to blame. From a reliable source it can be confidently stated that there is no evidence that the Society’s literature has proved harm, ful to the native population</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">; on</span><span class="font4"> the other hand, the very opposite is true, as was indicated in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 3, 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the ease of the Copper Belt riots, where it was shown that the literature had had the effect of keeping its readers out of the trouble. Therefore the attitude of the Government in refusing European control is quite unjustified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is making remarkable headway’ in Southern Rhodesia; yet very few can see it. Most Rhodesians don’t go to church, and many that do</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">are not enthusiastic about it. Rome’s method of operation in this case is to establish convent schools, of which there are several throughout the Colony. There are very many who say that the education there available is superior to that provided at the Government schools, and, of course, unsuspecting non-Catholic parents send their children to the convent school, which undertakes not to interfere in the child’s religion. The Hierarchy knoAs the value of training the mind of the child, and its subtle and unscrupulous methods deceive nearly everybody; yet on the quiet Rome is making great progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In certain Government departments the Roman Catholic political institution is well established. The chief of the police is one of the leading Catholics in the Colony, and many people have commented on the relationship that exists between promotions and the religion of the individual concerned. The writer had three interviews with the chief native commissioner. This gentleman is not a Roman Catholic, but two of these conversations were interrupted by priests, who appeared to be on unusually friendly terms with him. The chief native commissioner, under whose care there are a million natives, sees no danger in allowing this political institution plenty of liberty in establishing its racket firmly among the native population. Ho imagines he has the situation well under his control, but he will never be able to say he was not warned. Rome’s plans are well-laid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The battle of Armageddon, soon to take place, will not miss the European community of Southern Rhodesia. There are, however, a few who give every indication of seeking to know Jehovah and receive His protection in that terrible time. Maybe they and their children will form the nucleus of the new Society of Rhodesia and receive the blessings of the new government now being established—Jehovah’s Theocracy.—Robert Nisbet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">TWO thousand years ago diamonds were very rare indeed. They were said to be owned only by kings. The Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder comments on six different kinds of diamonds, mentioning their almost unbelievable hardness and their rarity. He also mentions two incorrect ideas which persisted for many years after his death: namely, that diamonds would withstand hammering on an anvil, and that the only way to soften them was to soak them in goat’s blood. As an industry diamond mining probably originated in India between the years SOO and 600 B.C. For well over a thousand years that country was the only known source of supply, and then stones were discovered in Borneo. From that time until discoveries in Brazil, Other fields were unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Brazilian mines have so far produced sixteen million carats, but supplies are declining and the mines are now overshadowed by the South African fields. However, 20,00b carats per annum are still produced! Bahia being the chief center and, incidentally, the only spot in the world where the carbonado, or black diamond, has been discovered. This dull, lusterless, porous stone, composed of tiny, interlocking crystals, is tremendously tough, and is therefore in great demand in certain branches of the industry. In the early days of the Brazilian mines, this stone was thought to be of no value, and great quantities were thrown away by the miners. Today it brings a price comparable to that of ordinary' diamonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The diamond fields of South Africa are easily in the van of the industry' today. Since the year 1873 the Union has produced 185,-000,000 carats, or three-quarters of all the diamonds owned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diamond mining is painstaking work. Only one part of the rock in 14,000,000 is diamond, and of that small portion only about a quarter is of any value. These figures are from the World’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">richest</span><span class="font4"> source of supply. During the past sixty years hundreds of millions of tons of rock have been mined to produce gems which could be packed in an ordinary cabin trunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diamond cutting and polishing as it is understood today was not discovered until the year 1475. Before that time stones were polished with substances softer than the diamonds themselves or by rubbing one diamond against the other. This was a very tedious and laborious process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that the familiar round shape, or '''brilliant” cut, was invented, and today this type of cut has been developed to a point of scientific exactness. The laws of refraction and reflection are taken advantage of and each facet is cut at a certain angle in order to bring out the full luster and brilliance. There are variations in shape, depending on the fashion of the moment or upon the shape of the stone in its original state. When cut in standard style, however, the diamond has 58 facets. The main facet is called the “table”, and sloping from this, at an angle of about 35 degrees, are 32 “top” facets, while underneath are 24 facets, sloping again, this time at an angle of 41 degrees, to the “point&quot;, which itself has a small facet to prevent its chipping off. Some idea of the intricacy of this work may be had when it is remembered that some stones are smaller than pinheads, and yet all have these 58 facets. — James A. Williams, Lithuania.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ The view is occasionally expressed that the native is 'well and happy in his own surroundings, and that it is a mistake to introduce him to modern ideas as to sanitation, diet, and so forth. Even a superficial investigation of conditions will show this to be a disastrous fallacy ; birth rate, infantile mortality, physique, and general health all indicate a population subjected to a perpetual drain only partially offset by sun, fresh air, and the African’s natural vitality.—From a brochure by Major G.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan Shortens the Matches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The Japanese government requested the match manufacturers to shorten the length of the match stick by twenty-nine one-thousandths of an inch. It is calculated that in the course of a year this would save enough to keep the army going about one hour and five minutes. Toy balloons may not now be had: the rubber is needed for war purposes. It is hard now to buy an iron frying pan, and is expected to be impossible shortly. The people are being urged to wear wooden shoes, instead of leather. A private citizen may buy but two gallons of gasoline a day. All raw cotton and cotton cloth have been removed from domestic use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ The Chinese Republic accomplished a very considerable feat in building, in eight months, a new motor road from the provisional capital at Chungking to the Burmese border, a distance of 1,400 miles. The road was built entirely by coolie labor and without any modern equipment. Stone rollers, carved on the spot, were drawn to and fro by bullocks, but, anyway, the road was finished and is a success. War supplies ean now go into China from Rangoon, Burma, which, for the present, is far out of reach of Japanese planes or Japanese warships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Paying for Their Own Murder</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The clever rulers of North China are making the Chinese pay for their own murder. Wherever the Japanese armies gain control, the sale of opium spreads out behind them like a fan, destroying the populace and providing the conquerors with the funds wherewith to destroy still other areas. American travelers in areas controlled by the Japanese report fields of poppies, and it is a matter of common knowledge that for ten years past Japan has been the world’s chief distributor of this accursed drug.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ Give the Chinese credit for something new in warfare. To protect themselves from mosquitoes in the Kutang swamps the Chinese soldiers were equipped with enormous mosquito hoods. When they charged through the morning mists the first Japanese troops to behold them fled in screaming confusion, thinking they were being attacked by ghosts with machine guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese Must Wear Rayon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Because the money hitherto used to buy cotton must now be used to buy war materials, the Japanese government has ordered the Japanese people to cease using and » wearing cotton goods and to substitute therefor the synthetic rayon. Japan will continue to be the largest cotton manufacturing nation, but all its cotton goods will be exported. Its own people must wear rayon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ Pressure on the French, whether direct from Japan or indirect via Vatican City, resulted in holding 1,000 motor trucks and thousands of tons of war supplies in French Indo - China, contrary to treaties in force between France and China. But today few treaties are worth the paper on which they are written. France had a treaty with Japan not to seize the island of Hainan, but that meant nothing. The island was seized anyway.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">BEING </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">boy of 18 years of age 1 hardly know whether or not I have the right to ask or criticize what kind of a world we, the boys and girls of today, are being led into. We would like to have the privilege of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">knowing </span><span class="font4">the answers to the following questions, with me asking for the thousands who are wondering and worrying over the problems facing us. We want you voters and officeholders to know that we aren’t asleep on the job, that we think as much of our country as you do because we are going to take the responsibility of it in a few years. No, Mr. Editor, we are not asleep, we are afraid </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">being ridiculed if we try anything smart, as some people would say. May I say that anyone may feel free to correct or criticize me on any of my statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us look at the situation as it stands today in a nonpolitical, nonprejudiced manner and see if the young people look at it right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We, the younger generation, are facing a 40-bill ion-dollar debt with increasing interest. We are facing the unemployment problem. People are living on subsistence diets. The people don’t own their homes and farms. The boys and girls are not financially able to attend college. The crime problem in the United States is the greatest in the civilized world. People are living in unfit houses, and going without proper medical care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why do such things exist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We owe $320 per person when we have 10 billion-dollars in gold salted down in Kentucky out of a possible 14 billion in the world.' We arc the richest country in the world by far. We have more resources than any other three countries. Why did we borrow so much money? Who did we borrow it from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been estimated that between 10 and 20 million people are unemployed. Why do cotton mills and clothing factories close (when our fellow^ men wear inadequate clothing) to put thousands out of work? We grow enough cotton, in faet the farmers are paid to plow it under and the government officials are sent down to paj’ the farmer to cut down production. We have the cotton,-we have the factories and we have plenty of men to operate the factories; so why are there so many peo</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ple </span><span class="font4">oiit of work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People are living on subsistence diets and again the farmers are ordered to plow under the wheat and shoot down the cattle. Each year our government borrows millions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to give </span><span class="font4">the farmer so he won’t raise so much to eat and wear. We live in the most independent country in the world, as far as any product goes, and our people live on subsistence diets and wear inadequate clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The majority of the farmers don’t own their farms. Yes, there is plenty of land (over three million square miles) : enough for every farmer to own around 400 acres. Who owns all this land? Look at the people who do not own their homes. Would it surprise you to know that in Oklahoma there is enough granite to build every Oklahoma family a nice comfortable home ? Is there any excuse for people living in dugouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The boys and girls are not able to attend college, and every day the situation grows to where we must train ourselves to live in this specialized world. Look at the men in the army and navy that are being trained. They are the healthiest and the most physically and mentally fit of all our people. They are being trained, but not to be the best doctor or the best engineer—they are being trained to shed blood. The boys are not to blame, because they have been taught that it is honorable and glorious to die on the battlefield or be blinded or be crippled for life. The government spends lots of money on them, but if you want to be a doctor or an expert engineer you have to have the money or else you must go to school in the daytime and work at night on less than three meals a day. It is all right to spend money on a large army and navy, but if you don’t have the money to be a builder of civilization it’s your own hard luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our crime problem grows more tense every day. Why should we have crime when we have the best schools in the world to teach those fellows the better things of life? We spend enough money on each convict in one year to send him to a university for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this wonderful country of ours, where we have “riches for all men”, where </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">untold </span><span class="font4">wealth lies underground, where rich soil and rich ‘ forests can support almost the whole world, the home of modern factories and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">won</span><span class="font4">derful schools, is there any reason why people should go hungry and wear shabby clothes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and be a burden and a drawback to mankind 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May it be known to all that I am not criticizing any person or organization, that I am sincerely just an interested bystander in the affairs of our government, and that I am not supporting any political organization. Every word I have said is from the bottom of my heart. I am as patriotic as anyone to my country. I would die for it, but I wouldn’t like to go 3,000 miles from its boundaries to do it. When you voters go to the polls to vote remember that posterity will prove your judgment. Think of us when you vote, because we are going to accept the responsibility of, the government in a few years. We don’t want a Utopia. We just want a nice place to live, protection and security.

<p><span class="font4">War is inevitable. It is a divine institution. “I believe war is the divinely appointed means by which the environment may be adjusted.” (Maude, in “War and the World’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Life.”) One thing is certain: environment is always changed and almost every time for the best of humanity, although the victor is<sub>(</sub> by no means the gainer in all wars. History confirms its inevitability. In the 3,433 years of known history prior to 1937, there were 3,152 years of war and 281 years of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Human nature, unchanged, makes war inevitable. Between states the only cheek on injustice is force. That has been brought out very clearly in many cases of modern social adjustment in recent years and is now in operation, in the minds of people at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">War exerts a wholesome moral influence and develops patriotism, unselfishness, efficiency, economy, inventiveness, courage, science and a sense of social equality. All this we have seen take place right before our eyes. War performs the function of selecting the best nation and prevents overpopulation. It develops the race at the expense of the individual. All this will be a reality if the war is prolonged to any extent. There are economic values in war. It gives employment and teaches trades, along with the general gain in territory and in the field of' commerce, and in crushing competition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Devouring Widows’ Houses’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Meet the benevolent “Reverend” Albert J. Pitman, Downer’s Grove, Illinois. In January, 1938, he visited Theodore Vrdoljak, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, then in prison in that city for preaching the gospel, and told him that if he would promise not to take any more Wateh Tower literature to the people he would see that he w<sup>r</sup>as released from prison at once. Just why a clergyman should have the right or the privilege to exercise such power is not known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the “Reverend” Pitman was benevolent to two other persons, himself and his wife, this time at the expense of an 85-year-old widow of a Civil War soldier. He felt that he and his wife could make good use of her property and also of her pension. The lady in question, Bertha A. Pyne, was herself charitably minded. When the “Reverend” Pitman came to her home soliciting food for the poor she gave the “gentleman” twelve hens, which certainly was a very considerable gift to accept from one old lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But “Reverend” Pitman was not done accepting gifts. Mrs. Pyne slipped and fell, and “Reverend” Pitman said he would take her to his home and care for her. First he had her sit up in bed and sign a deed to her home, but without reading it to her; then he had her sign a power of attorney, and with that went to the bank and drew out all her savings, $310, and had it put in his own name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then he started cashing her pension checks, and collected in all $225, and felt so prosperous that he talked of building himself a new home. But about that time Mrs. Pyne woke up to the fact that “Reverend” Pitman is in the religious business, and therefore entirely selfish and unreliable; so she decided to go back to her own castle. After ■ she got back home he got $40 more out of the old lady by giving her $10 for a $50 check.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preacher and his wife stripped Mrs. Pyne’s little home of most of its good things, replacing her good bedroom rug with a poor one, but gladly accepting two nice ones that she made for them while she was their “guest”. The holy gent of the cloth had a woman come to help Mrs. Pyne for two days, and paid the worklady $4.50 in chicken feed that belonged to Mrs. Pyne. But in due time he rendered a bill to Mrs. Pyne for the $4.50, as if he had himself paid it in cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems that Mrs. Pyne lost her $310 postal savings, $225 in pension money, $40 in the short-change operation, and sundry and divers other chattels, all because she did not then know as much about these religious birds as she does now. At present she would not trust</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ What 1 like about these fighters in the Watch Tower (Jehovah’s witnesses) is the way they defend democracy and expose the evils of Fascism, They’re always eternally right when they educate the masses regarding the Fascist conspiracies of the Catholic Hierarchy in Ethiopia, Italy, Spain and other centers of Fascist intrigue. This is no new phenomenon. 1 have watched these enemies of militarism fight their campaigns for decades. During the World AV ar, when Judge Rutherford and other leaders in his movement were sent to prison because of their peace propaganda, I studied their efforts with admiration, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 3, 1939 </span><span class="font4">later, when a member of Rutherford’s editorial department supplied me with an amazing array of data, I issued a special edition of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Appeal to Reason,</span><span class="font4"> of which I was editor at the time. I joined in a plea for amnesty for these lovers of peace and social justice, and I’m glad to say that many extra copies of the little old </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Appeal—</span><span class="font4">perhaps several hundred thousand, if my memory doesn’t betray me—went far and wide with the plea that a great injustice had been done Judge Rutherford and his dissenters. I was a Freethinker then, as I’m now, but that didn’t hinder me from joining them in their struggle to preserve our Bill of Rights, which then was under direct attack at the hands of the militarists. Today, I’m still a Freethinker, of course, but I continue to stand by Judge Rutherford and his colleagues, because they are pouring immense energy into the splendid task of educating the American masses, in the direction of a strengthened democracy and an unfriendly, hostile atmosphere for the doctrines of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">forces of black reaction and Catholic-Fascism. Judge Rutherford, like the editor of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The American Freeman,</span><span class="font4"> has no prejudice against the misguided and misled Catholic masses. They -are the helpless victims of the cunning Hierarchy. We both see eye to eye here and, frankly, many times I read some of his paragraphs and wonder if they really aren’t from my own pen.

<p><span class="font4">Don’t carry your pocketbook in your hip pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t become careless when in a crowd—keep your coat btittoned— and your eye- on your pockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t be too eager to show your money in banks, theaters, railroad depots, steamboat landings or other public places. It is an invitation for criminals to follow or rob you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t fall asleep in public places; this gives thieves an opportunity thieves are looking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t carry your handbag suspended by a strap from your wrist. Hold it tightly in your hand. This prevents thieves </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font4">opening the bag or taking valuables from it—or cutting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">strap to steal the handbag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t leave a note on the door bell announc</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing that </span><span class="font4">you are out and will return at a given time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t leave your key under the mat, or over the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t pull all the shades of your apartment when you go out; it is an invitation for thieves to enter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t fail to note the distinctive marks on your valuables. This greatly assists the police in their search. Number and movement of wateh, all descriptive marks on jewelry, etc., keep recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t leave valuable clothing or jewelry in a rear room with windows unlocked while entertaining friends in the front. You are assisting burglars to burglarize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t allow strangers who represent themselves as meter readers, etc., into your house unless they can show credentials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t leave valuables in the house when </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font4">go away for a vacation. Thieves can enter any house if they have time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t think an open window is safe from intrusion because it is not near a fire escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t give strangers information regarding your neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t close your house or apartment for any considerable time without being sure the windows are securely fastened; don’t rely on ordinary locks; nail the windows if necessary; heavy bolt locks are most secure for doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t go on your vacation without giving written notice of your absence to the police headquarters; the police are glad to give your property special attention. — Altoona (Pa.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mirror.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>The Law of Absolute Justice</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">♦ In Pennsylvania a miner seized his two-year-old child who had thrown his pay envelope atop a hot stove, rushed outside with him and chopped off both hands. His wife returned just as the act was finished, threw up both hands and fell dead. In Pieton street, Brighton, England, a Royal Air Force pilot beat his seven-year-old son black and blue for stealing a watch and then compelled him to hold live coals in his hands until amputation was believed to be necessary. What about the law of absolute justice for fathers like this? If an eye for an eye, a life for a life, is absolute justice, absolutely right, what right has either of these fathers to retain his own hands ? Paragraphs like this are a sorrow to every lover of justice. What is there about either of these fathers that the Creator would wish to remember unless they really repent?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ In our personal relations, there is approval of truth-telling, of respect for others’ possessions and for others’ lives. The opposites of these are disapproved—lying, stealing, homicide. And with the disapproval goes disgrace. But when men’s minds move out into the region of national conduct, then suddenly from some cupboard of the mind comes an entirely different standard, and a man is praised and' rewarded for deeds that between individuals would blacken his name. Men are decked out in most honored vestments and are given high titles, to go forth and deliberately seize others’ land, burn their dwellings, and slaughter them and their families.—George M, Stratton, in a lecture at the University of California.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ Since the kidnaping of the Lindbergh baby, March 1, 1932, there were 18 other kidnaping cases in the United States that attracted general attention. Two of the kidnapers were lynched, two committed suicide, eight were executed or are awaiting execution, six are imprisoned for life, and sixteen others are in prison for terms of an average of forty years each. In only one case was the kidnap gang successful. They tried the same stunt a second time, and the four involved drew sentences of 386 years. Looks like a bum business.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Dictators</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">T H)AS been shown in these columns that Jehovah God is the great Theoerat and that Christ Jesus is the Ruler of His church by the will of God. That being true, then why should not all Christians favor the rule of the nations by dictators; rather than by the people themselves? The plain reason’is this: The organization called “the church” and the organization known as “the state” are and indeed must be entirely separate from each other. The church is heavenly. The state is entirely earthly. Many sincere men have for years seen that there must be a complete separation of “church” and state, even though they have not clearly discerned what constitutes the true church. In countries where the law requires the complete separation of “church and state” the men who control the religious organizations called “churches” have much to do with the politics of the nation and the politicians generally seek the support of the religious leaders. Therefore there is in truth and in fact a close relationship between the state and the religious organizations called, “the church”. The United States is a ease exactly in point. The big politicians seek the favor of big churchmen that they may receive the political support of the members of that religious organization. The big clergymen seek the favpr of political rulers that they may have adulation from the political rulers, which increases their influence over the people. In . Germany it is understood that the religious clergy are in the pay of the stafe. In England the clergymen receive support from the state. None of these, however, are any part of the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “church of the living God”, which is the only church within the meaning of that term as described in the Bible, is entirely separate and distinct from all worldly organizations. Everyone who is of the true church of God is admonished to keep himself separate and unspotted from the world. (James 1: 27) Jehovah God selects the members of His church, and no man does any of the seleet-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 3, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing. It is entirely inconsistent, therefore, for </span><span class="font4">any man or men to attempt to rule </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God's or</span><span class="font4">ganization. Jehovah has made Christ Jesus the Head and Ruler over His church, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">everyone who is called to a place in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God's </span><span class="font4">church must be fully obedient to Christ. Christ is perfect and always rules right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people have organized themselves into governments, and it is their privilege to rule themselves; hence a democracy, that is to say, a rule “of the people, by the people and for the people”, is more nearly right than </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font4">other method of worldly rule. In these latter days, which the Scriptures long ago designated as 'times of peril’, the Devil is desperately attempting to turn all men away from God. The Devil gets control of the religious organizations, which organizations give honor and praise to men rather than to God. The chief and leading religious organization on the earth is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority, which is arbitrarily ruled by men and w<sup>r</sup>ith which the people have nothing to do. It will be observed that in every </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">coun</span><span class="font4">try where political dictators rule, the great religious organization supports the same, the rulers become very oppressive and take away the rights of the people, and the people suffer. Dictators regiment the people and compel them to do what the dictator wants to have done, and the individual rights of the people disappear. If the dictator desires to make war on another, nation, the common people have nothing whatsoever to say about it, but must go and fight, regardless of whether right or wrong. In such countries the big religious Hierarchy supports such arbitrary rule, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">the people suffer and conditions grow worse. The rule of the people being by extremely selfish men, that rule is extremely wicked. Concerning such the Lord says, “When the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” (Proverbs 29:2) That scripture exactly describes the condition existing today in every country where dictators rule. While the governing power remains with the people that elect their own representatives they have power to remove or discharge those who do wrong. With the dictators in power the people can do nothing to protect their rights. If a dictator were just, right and righteous in all things, possessing perfect wisdom, justice and unselfishness, then his rule would be in the interest of the people and they would rejoice. On the contrary, all men are imperfect, and when </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a <a name="bookmark89"></a><a name="bookmark90"></a>dictator has absolute power he becomes cruel </span><span class="font4">and wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">great and righteous One, and His </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rule </span><span class="font4">will be in righteousness and He will give to the people peace and prosperity and life. The people then will rejoice and be glad. ‘'Behold, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isaiah 32:1) Concerning Jesus it is written: ‘Unto us a [King] is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and of the peace of His government there shall be no end.’ (Isaiah 9:6,7) Note now the contrast announced by the Lord, when the people are ruled by selfish dictators and when they are ruled by the righteous One: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked bear-</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">eth </span><span class="font4">rule, the people mourn.”—Proverbs </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">29: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dictatorial rule by men of the present </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font4">is an attempt to establish a counterfeit of God’s righteous government and in mockery of Jehovah God and in reproach </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">His name. Therefore suffering results to the people. Peace, prosperity, happiness, joy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">eon-</span><span class="font4">tentment and life everlasting are the blessings which the -Lord will bestow upon the obedient people during His reign. What the people now need is to see and appreciate that their hope of salvation and blessing comes only by and through God’s kingdom. The Devil and his religious allies desperately </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at</span><span class="font4">tempt to keep the people in ignorance of these truths concerning God’s kingdom. However, within a short time,, according to God’s promise, the wicked rule shall end for ever, and the righteous rule of Christ Jesus will go on without interruption and the obedient people will greatly rejoice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses frequently use “sandwich signs” to convey information and opinion to the public. They thus inform the public where meetings for the worship of Almighty God will be held. A service is thus rendered to the people, and information of great value disseminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone of “importance” in New York is opposed to the use of “sandwich signs”. The claim is made that the “sandwich sign” man mars the beauty of the streets, and some fastidious individuals want everything in town to be pretty and' nice, just so, for the 1939 World’s Fair. It may be, also, that the delicate susceptibilities of religionists are shocked by having the way of truth pointed out to those who read as they walk. It may be, too, that some of these religionists have knowledge that Jehovah’s witnesses are gathering in con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ns” Are Legal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">vention at New York this summer and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font4">greatly fear that the “sandwich signs” will convey information to the population </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font4">that convention and about the address to be given in Madison Square Garden on June 25 by Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anyway, for some reason Police Commissioner Valentine was moved to issue a traffic regulation which provided that no person should carry any “advertising sign, placard, poster or similar device” on the sidewalks or streets of New York. The order was given that the regulation would go into effect on the first day of April and that all who violated its provisions would be arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This regulation is nicely worded and looks like a real law. It would be a law were it not for the fact that it violates certain fundamental rights of all people. Carrying a “sandwich sign&quot; to and fro upon the busy streets constitutes an activity of the press. The United States Supreme Court, in the case of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell </span><span class="font4">v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin</span><span class="font4"> (303 U.S. 444), held that the press constitutes any means of conveying information or opinion. In that decision it included as part of the press the printing and circulation of books, booklets and pamphlets. The only difference between a “sandwich sign” and a pamphlet is that one is perpendicular and the other horizontal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Commissioner Valentine was notified by</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses that his regulation took in too much territory, and that it was illegal, invalid, unconstitutional, null and void, because it abridged and denied the fundamental liberty of freedom of the press. The commissioner’s attention was drawn to the action of the United States District Court for New Jersey, which ruled that a Jersey City ordinance prohibiting the carrying of placards was illegal and void. He was further informed that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals at Philadelphia had confirmed and upheld that ruling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The relations of the New York police and Jehovah’s witnesses have.always been pleasant and agreeable. Therefore counsel informed the commissioner, on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, that they regretted the necessity of questioning his regulation, but that they had to do so and that they intended to continue using &quot;sandwich signs” at such times and places as they deemed advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' Therefore on the day the new regulation went into effect 180 of Jehovah’s witnesses went forth on the streets of lower Manhattan (New York city) with signs and placards giving the people information that religion is a racket and telling them where they could learn more about that racket. Up and down the streets they went and not one of them w'as arrested. The police co-operated beautifully. They held up traffic for the “sand-wichers” and some of them expressed great interest in the message &quot;Fascism or Freedom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So it appears that &quot;sandwich signs” are still legal in New York. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">WENTY-TWO years on the bench of the Federal courts at New York is part of the record of Martin T. Manton. During that time Uncle Sam paid him a total of $246,000 to administer justice to all people. The judge’s gross income during that period was over a million dollars, three-fourths of which came from various real estate corporations in which he was interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February, 1939, Judge Manton resigned under fire. A Federal grand jury became interested in his affairs and now several indictments have been filed against him, charging that he and others formed a conspiracy to &quot;endeavor to influence, obstruct, impede and hinder and to corruptly influence, obstruct, impede, hinder and embarrass the due administration of justice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the charges of the indictment are true, . the judge obstructed justice by deciding eases in favor of certain persons in return for large sums of money paid to corporations which he controlled or in which he was interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of Jehovah’s witnesses recall the part Judge Manton had in keeping Judge Rutherford and his associates in a Federal penitentiary during the World War. Application was made to Manton for bail while their case was pending on appeal. Manton denied the application on July 12, 1918. Further application was later made to a full Circuit Court of three judges and allowed in March, 1919.

<p><span class="font4">♦ The most expensive kitchens are the $17,000 dining-car kitchens out of which, because of their perfectly planned details, it is not at all uncommon to serve 300 meals or more per day. The regular equipment of a Pennsylvania Railroad dining car includes 1,945 articles of table and kitchen ware and 1,609 pieces of linen. The cooking is done in a space 13 feet long, and another 13 feet is divided between the space for dish-washing and the pantry. The free floor space is only 24 feet wide for the whole 26 feet. The Pennsylvania has 150 dining ears and crews rushing at express speeds across thirteen states and ready to give you about anything you wish to eat. In a year the bill of fare contains 2,500,000 eggs, 1,300,000 oranges, 550,000 pounds of fowl, 390,000 pounds of beef, 490,000 pounds of pork products, 1,000,000 pounds of potatoes, 300,000 pounds of fish, 350,000 heads of lettuce, and 2,000,000 cups of coffee.

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>“Mary Mother of God” (?)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE dogma that Mary is the mother of God is absurd and without Scriptural foundation. Jehovah God is without beginning or ending, and had neither mother nor father. Jesus, the Son of God, in his prehuman condition was the direct creation of Jehovah and had no mother,—John 1:1-3; Revelation 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that Mary was highly honored in being made the medium through which the prehuman Logos became identified with humanity and came to earth as the babe Jesus that eventually He might become the Christ. But having served this purpose in the scheme of redemption, Mary is allowed to drop out of the Bible drama, and is never again heard of save in one or two isolated instances where she is seen in conversation with the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting to note that in every recorded conversation Jesus appears to take pains to remind Mary that she must not attempt to presume upon the maternal tie. Never once did He apply to her the name Mother, that title which falls so sweetly upon the ears of every woman as it comes from the lips of her offspring. On every occasion Jesus addressed her as “Woman”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take for instance His abrupt rejoinder .to the maternal plea at the wedding at Cana of Galilee when the wine had run out—“Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.” (John 2:4) Did Jesus here sense an appeal to the emotions to perform a mighty work on the basis of family ties? Or did He with prophetic vision see in this request the initial step in the course of pre. sumption which has since filled the earth? Whatever the motive, it is beyond question that He, by His answer, refused to acknowledge any indebtedness to the ties of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor was this the only occasion on which the Master indicated that these were not the supreme inspiration of His ministry. In Matthew 12: 46-50 it is recorded that when one said unto Him, ‘Thy mother and thy brethren desire to speak with thee,Jesus replied, “Who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font4">is my mother? and who are my brethren?” And stretching forth His-hand toward His disciples He said, “Behold my mother, and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” The supreme place in the affections of Jesus was not reserved for those related to Him by ties of blood, but for those united to Him in a spirit of devotion to the will of the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This attitude He consistently retained throughout His ministry. In Luke 11:27 it is recorded that a certain woman said unto Him, “Blessed is the womb that oare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.” Note ~ the immediate reply of the Lord, in yerse 28: “Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The teaching'of the Roman Hierarchy that Mary as the “Mother of God” exercises extreme potency over the risen Christ is therefore a gross presumption without any foundation in fact and totally opposed to the spirit of Jesus while He was on earth, hhir-thermore, throughout the long period preceding the second advent of the Messiah, Marj was just as truly dead as any other member of Adam's race, and, therefore, could not appeal for any, either to the Father or to the Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even if, in the resurrection of the sleeping saints, she found a place in the heavenly realm, we may rest assured that the attitude of the Lord toward her has not changed one iota, and that no fleshly tie will weigh with Him in heaven any more than “in the days of His flesh” (Hebrew's 5:7) on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But while Jesus did not at any time allow the will of the flesh to influence Him, let it not be assumed that He was unfilial and without a proper regard for her who brought Him into the world. Such was not the case. John 19:25-27 records the dramatic occasion when Jesus, hanging upon the tree, saw Mary standing there, supported in her maternal agony by the beloved disciple, and how He spoke to her. Not even on this poignant occasion did He address her as Mother. What He did say to her was, “Woman, behold thy son 1” But to the disciple He said, “Behold thy mother!” “And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here the tender solicitude of Jesus was manifested, in committing the wmman whom God had honored by using her in His purpose for redemption, and who had lavished upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Him all the wealth of her maternal love, to the care of that disciple who more than the others had imbibed the spirit of the Master himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what a blasphemous carica-<sup>tlire</sup> her who was truly blessed among women, to place her in the presumptuous and impossible posi-Ij<sub>on o</sub>f “Mother of God”! And what a slanderous misrepresentation to maintain that Jesus in heaven would do what He absolutely refused to do while on earth: allow himself to be moved by a mere fleshly kinship ! These ideas, put forward by the Roman , '&quot;Catholic Hierarchy, are born, not of God, but of the Devil, the father of lies; and no earnest seeker after truth will be deceived there-by.—Wm. W.

<p><span class="font4">♦ Newcastle, Australia, had a tremendous exhibition of (idolatry: 120,000 people were present to “honor” a little piece of bread. Women of the Holy Grail (it is anybody’s guess as to what a “holy grail” is like) were ■in vivid green and brown. There were 200 satin-frocked flower-str ewers, who sprinkled rose petals on the pavement for somebody else to sweep up. As the main object of idolatry passed many of the people got down on their knees, and lots of the girls mined their stockings kneeling on the asphalt. Archbishop Panico, in charge of the circus, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With solemn and simple ritual the King of Kings has just passed by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was a blasphemy. Nothing of the sort happened. The whole arrangement is of the Devil, intended to glorify him, dishonor God and Christ and lead men to worship their fellow men because of their false religious claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The simple ritual included airplanes flying in cross formation overhead, processionists marching in the form of a cross, five hundred Papal knights, priests and others, in lovely dresses, a life-size crucifix, tintinnabulation of a golden-throated bell (wasn’t that \ the berries!), trumpeters sounding a fanfare from Roman bugles, and, finally, the center of it all, a little piece of bread riding in a chariot covered with costly silks and gold-laee . work, enclosed in a monstrance of solid gold, four feet high. It was all so simple.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">♦ The “Reverend Father” Rumble, writing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Freeman’s Journal</span><span class="font4"> of October 7, 1937, was only 83-percent to 88-pereent in error in the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On such indications as science has been able to offer so far I would say that the first man was created at least 35,000 years ago, and possibly 50,000 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Reverend” Rumble knows mighty little about the Scriptures, and believes less; for their testimony on this subject is clear and convincing. But of one thing he seems perfectly certain, and that is that Judge Rutherford, because he is a student of the Scriptures, and a believer in them, is a dangerous man. In his eyes anybody who believes the Bible and dares teach it is a “religious </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">quack”. </span><span class="font4">It is easy to call names. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is </span><span class="font4">a substitute </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">courage and honesty.</span></p>

This sounds ridiculous but tests verify its accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Were the presence of electricity generated .. by the stream of water the cause for the ability to discern the presence of such water, it would indeed be ridiculous to state that this could be determined by the study of a map of the district; but if the root cause is demonism, that is to say, if one of the fallen angels controls the mind of the “dowser” and in that way indicates the spot where the water flows, the claim to discern the presence of water by means of a map alone is far from ridiculous.</span></p>

In a store at Blackpool goods jump from the shelves, an inkwell leaps from the counter and splashes its contents over the manager’s clothes, rubber stamps jump about like mad. The “Father Divine” bunk spreads to the ends of the earth. At Houghton, Michigan, a man under demoniac control thinks he is Christ and killed a maid with a flatiron to drive the Devil out of her. At White Cloud, Michigan, a 33-year-old woman said the Lord told her to go into the woods, strip naked and wander for five days. She was fool enough to obey the Devil, who put the proposition up to her, and, oddly enough, survived. When found, in cold weather, too, she was unconscious and dressed only in leaves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The 141-mile White Sea-Baltic canal, which was completed in 1933, makes it possible to carry freight and passengers between the two seas in a fraction of the time it formerly- took. Previously it had been necessary for vessels to sail hundreds of miles around the Scandinavian countries. The greatest waterway project completed under the Soviet regime, and one of the greatest in all history, is the Volga-Moscow canal, which was put into operation in July, 1937. The work involved in the building of the eighty-mile canal and subsidiary structures was similar in scope to that of the Panama canal, which was under construction for a period of thirty-five years.

To stretch out it is necessary to ask the one under the bench to yield his place. The lack of air is a horrible torture in such a place. Even the tiny peephole is covered from the outside. Cries for air mean nothing, as the guards in the corridors are under orders to maintain absolute silence. In some prisons the slaughterhouse is in the exact center of the courtyard where the prisoners take their daily walk.

<p><span class="font4">I M HE STOOD in the square with the t'wJ V sun shining down on all his splen-La T \ M dor. The gold of his gown reflected HL, Vj)S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun and the lace</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">hung around him like dew hanging on a rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He lifted his frail, bejeweled hand to bless the tanks, and the lace on his sleeve fell back in a cascade of sheer beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the blessings of God [the god of this world, the Devil—Ed.] he sent the tanks forth to do their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He moved on to the ranks of soldiers, men created by men to look as one, to act as one and to speak as one, but never to think; for thought was forbidden—only the dictator should think. What more docs a country need —a servant of God to bless, a dictator to command, and men to obey, fight and die. Surely this makes a country great? . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The old men, women and children stood and watched. Such beauty and strength left them dazed. Surely there could be no greater beauty than the pious man in his gorgeous robes, the word of God standing bejeweled before all the ignorant people, chanting beautiful words they could not understand, and showering his blessings upon the instruments of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dictator stood saluting his army and looking with pride upon those about to be killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Proud wives and mothers gazed with adoration in their eyes at the men whom they called theirs, but who were really sacrifices upon the altar of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Children waved flags but could not understand why. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Out on the desert, under the blazing sun, the tanks rolled on—masses of metal made to kill, but with the blessings of God upon them. As they rumbled through the villages they spat fire, killing men, women and children, and the soldiers marched behind, killing those who had avoided the spit of the tanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Overhead in God’s blue sky hummed, not the beautiful plumed creatures of His creation, but the machines created by man and blessed by man in His name. As they circled above the little towns they dropped their bombs, destroying life, destroying homes and dreams. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A mother sitting with her two children,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">26</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">dusky little things with tear-stained faces, watched the machine circling around and across the sun. Their father had been killed and they sat by his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He had been a fine man, he had loved his family, and they had stood by helpless, and watched him killed. They had seen the man in the smart uniform holding the revolver, they had heard the report, and they had seen their father fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their father, so fine and good—they had seen him crumple up. Their mother had rushed towards him, flinging herself upon him, looking at him and shaking him, asking him to get up. They had never seen her so excited before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then she became very quiet and sat down by him. They came close to her, and they watched the blood trickle out of their father’s head—out through the thick black curly hair it had run slowly down his face onto the ground, forming a little pool around which the flies started buzzing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They watched his blood flowing and listened to the buzzing of the flies ; they clung to their mother and spoke to her, but she said nothing. She only gazed into the sky, ■watching the large bird which made so much noise and which was not created by God. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K Suddenly a bomb dropped a yard or so away, and the little boy who hj/U sat by his mother watched it bury itself in the earth and then fly up in <sub>a</sub> thousand pieces. He heard </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">shriek and, looking around, he saw his mother and baby sister stretched out across the body of his father. Blood was running from the place where his mother’s eyes had once been, and his sister’s face was smashed to pieces. In his own arm there was a hole, and the blood flowed from it; he put his hand upon his wounded arm and felt the blood sticky and warm upon his fingers. He clung to his mother and cried, but she could not hear him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On through the country went the instruments of war, crushing out life and causing misery and hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back in the sunlit square, the sun shining on the gold and lace, the frail, bejeweled hands were lifted in prayer, prayer for victory. Out on the parade ground strode the dictator inspecting new troops, saluting and being saluted. . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In a little church on one of the side streets knelt a mother all alone. The sun shone down through the stained-glass window, casting colored lights on her face and the deep crepe which she wore in memory of her son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She prayed before a Christ carved in wood, painted in realistic colors, but the sun shining through a piece of blue glass in the window cast a blue light on the Christ’s face, making the image look cold and hard. The ~ mother, lifting her head from her beads to glance at the Christ, saw the cold blue light that made the Christ seem strange and far away, and made her sad and frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was a great hatred in her heart towards the people who had killed her son— she who was so gentle and had never hated anyone before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She rose from her knees and walked slowly through the church; and as she walked towards the door leading to the little street she began to doubt God. She was frightened; for she thought “How </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font4"> there be a Godl” Her body had been wracked with pain to bring her son into the world I and now he had been shot down because of a country’s greed for power. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She walked towards the square where she - had last seen her son. It was filled with soldiers, new recruits, standing in the sunshine receiving blessings; and as she gazed at them she could see her son in each one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There on a balcony stood the servant of God—his hand lifted in the sunlight as he chanted his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She pushed her way through the crowds, her crepe being tom as she fought to get to the front of the masses, and 'when she got to the place just under the balcony she looked up and shouted “Down with war! Down with killing! Down with all those who bless war!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The police rushed forward and held her Vroughly, bruising her arms as they dragged her away.

<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Big Business</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">• Replying to criticism of heavy prices paid by the Government to a firm of aircraft manufacturers which gave a profit coming within the category of profiteering, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury admitted that the firm was able to complete its contract in three months less time than had been allowed for. He admitted that by itself the transaction might appear as profiteering; but the firm had urged their work forward, and had given a bonus to their employees, and were rather to be commended for what they had done. It is public knowledge that the firms and companies engaged in the varied phases of the armament business are making great profits. In the House of Commons a Labor member called Parliament’s attention to the trade in armament materials which was carried on between member nations of the British Empire and the three nations, Germany, Italy and Japan, that are keeping the world in a state of fear and unrest. He said, “Two days before Germany was supposed to be going to march into Czechoslovakia a cargo of 4,000 tons of copper left a Canadian port—copper which would have been converted into munitions of war to be dropped over here while we scuttled into our rabbit holes. What sense is there in it? Why cannot we take hold of this at the right end?” Reason and moral sense are alien to big business. Profit from any quarter is the main thing. The argument the Labor member used was that the people who supplied the copper could not fail to know that its use in Germany was for armaments, and that if they showed themselves ready to trade in raw war material there ought to be some supervision so as to prevent “trade” of this kind. The people of Britain must foot a yearly expense bill of nearly £1,000,000,000; and some of its patriots are doing good business by reason of the fact of the country’s enforced costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For more than fifteen years Judge Rutherford has contiriued to tell the peoples of earth that Big Business, Big Politics, and Religion are the Devil’s chief instruments to blind men as to the knowledge of God and to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">hold them under his sway. But little knowledge of history is needed to enable anyone to perceive the evil association -of power politics and religion, now reinforced by the financial masters of the earth. There are ardent supporters of the democratic form of government who have little love for the people who care little or nothing for the rights of free speech, for the freedom of the press and for those common institutions which give some liberty to the people. Democratic rule gives them freedom to exploit the people under the guise of commercial enterprise, or to make the poor inhabitants of the yet unenlightened places in the earth their slaves by what is styled “indented” labor. Those who have grown rich ’ by reason of possessing lands upon which heavy rentals must be paid because of the needs of the people, got their lands by no gift of God: someone robbed the people of their right to live on the land and enjoy the benefits of their labors, and those who have accumulated riches have done so, not by toil, but by being able to take advantage of the needs of the people, or by exploiting some of the weaknesses of men. Money as represented in Big Business has no compassion in the accumulation of its gains, but is out for what ' it can get. It has acted in exactly the same way as the predatory nations have acted towards the helpless peoples overseas, and Britain is the outstanding example since the terrible days of the Spanish conquests in North America and South America. From those rich__</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in land and from the great financial interests the politicians get their power, and religion as seen in the big church systems has ever been at the right hand of these.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">been brought against him by leading clerics ■ following broadcast lectures, and he says “the writings are insulting to the Christian ministry”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">John Hale’s statements are direct untruths, absolutely without foundation. A local representative of Jehovah’s -witnesses wrote the editor, and his letter stating this was published by the paper. It was pointed out that the publications complained of do not attack individuals, but only the systems which the individual parsons and religionists support, and that there is a wide difference between religion and Christianity. John Hale, who seems careful that his address ^should not be given, returns to the attack by suggesting that the work done (by Jehovah’s witnesses), being orderly and purposeful, must be counted as an organized religion. It seems a pity that John Hale does not inform himself about the matters now so important to every person who values truth and desires to worship God in spirit and in truth. The knowledge is easy . to get and is without price—he can get it without cost to himself if he so wishes, and it is 'priceless’ in its value to his eternal welfare. Jehovah’s witnesses do not sell books, nor have they sales talks. Certainly they take a contribution when offered, for the purpose of continuing the work they have as their service for the honor of the name of Jehovah, and in the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. It might appear strange that a man who complains about attacks on the clergy should himself be numbered amongst liars and evil-speakers. John.Hale makes no apology for his lies about Judge Rutherford’s writings, saying they have been held libelous and that successful actions had been taken against them'. But those who know how the clergy conduct the business of organized religion, and who know that it has no Scriptural support for its claims and its dogmas tvhile yet parading the Bible, are not surprised. ■ The books which Jehovah’s witnesses carry to the people do not speak evil of individuals, as such, nor does any individual amongst them h do so. Judge Rutherford in his broadcast lectures has never attacked individuals; it is the religion; the clergy and religionists who support them are told from the Scriptures just where they stand, and of the falsity of their position. The real trouble of these complainers is that they realize the truth is against them whether taken from the Scriptures or from the ordinary standards of human conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. MAY 3, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He would be a bold man who would say that the clergy are faithful to their own vows to their several organizations and to God, whom they profess to worship. It would be difficult to find through the length and breadth of Britain a minister or parson &quot;ordained” by any section of Protestants who openly accepts the vow's he made of his belief in the Bible as the Word of God, and in the creeds and dogmas of his church. These men are unbelievers in the Bible and are rebels against their own systems. But they do not come out into the open; they deceive their ignorant supporters; in other words, they are not true men, but are to be classed with hypocrites. The fact that they are all rebels is the immediate cause why the systems hold together. If John Hale is one of their number it is not strange that he should be put about when light is being thrown on the falsity of religion and all its claims to represent God and Christ. The people are being informed by Jehovah’s witnesses of the truth of the Scriptures. Are the clergy unscrupulous individuals, as John Hale suggests is stated? What docs the word mean? An unscrupulous person is one who is not actuated by right principles, one who is not honorable in his conduct. Can this be said of the clergy whom John Hale supports? The plain fact is that there is no more unscrupulous course of conduct than that taken by those who have violated and do continuously violate their vows as taken to God. The right principles of conduct are not present with them; they are neither faithful to God nor to those whom they profess to lead in the way of truth, and who foolishly trust to their &quot;superior knowledge”. Their position is dishonorable. If they would humble themselves and break away from their false position they would put themselves in position to learn the truth, and to find the way of salvation. Salvation from the wrath of God upon all things contrary to His will is to be found in following Christ, in Christianity. It is not to be found in religion. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">• The enormous amount of money which is being spent in order to prepare for the defense of the country against aggression, and to prepare shelter in air raids, is not causing any agitation. With the exception of extreme pacifists, there is general agreement that the Government has no alternative to its course of preparing for war. But when rearmament</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">29 </span><span class="font4">was first entered upon it was always spoken of as preparation for defense against aggression, and in view of the very warlike words and actions of the two dictators it seemed an urgent matter. But as the policy of appeasement has effected little change in the European condition, and because of the many quick changes in the moves for position, it is becoming plain to all that preparations to defend the coast and the towns and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font4">habitants of Britain are not sufficient in themselves, and the fighter’s method of defense by attack will need to be used. It is now announced by the Government that preparations are being organized which will enable Britain to land an army on the continent on short notice, and to keep it supplied with men and material. Britain is under obligation to go to the aid of Erance, not out of good will towards a neighbor, nor because France is yet a democratic country, but because France is one of the boundaries of Britain. If France should be overcome by the combined totalitarian forces the whole coast line of Europe would be closed to Britain, and that would mean its existence would be in peril. It is clear that the people in Britain are in for hard times and much curtailment of the limited measure of freedom and peace now enjoyed, war or on\v the threat of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This means that conscription is drawing on. It is advancing at present under cover of Air Raid Protection schemes, which, though they at the moment are spoken of as definitely of a voluntary' character, are almost certainly the prelude to some form of conscripted 'service. The prime minister, in a recent speech, spoke of the many young men in recript of the “dole” who are well able to w'ork but are shy in placing themselves in the hands of the authorities for work where they might be trained for serviceable occupations. His remarks caused some offense to some; for the implied suggestion that these should not continue to receive the dole was apparent. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds</span><span class="font4"> jVcw.s says, “A subcommittee of the Cabinet will have before it far-reaching schemes designed to force workless young men into forms of compulsory training,” and adds that influential Tories are pressing for such forms of conscription as will compel such able-bodied young men into employment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">• Recently some comments were made in these pages about the desolation of the High</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lands </span><span class="font4">of Scotland: whole </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tracts of country </span><span class="font4">denuded of the crofters in order that deer might roam and sport be provided </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font4">rich.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK ON EARTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is the work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses. These men and women from every walk of life devote their spare time to telling the people about God’s kingdom and the blessings it will bring to those who hear and obey the Lord. They carry a message of warning that those who now refuse to give heed to the Word of God and who do not forsake religion will perish for ever in the battle of Armageddon, which is just ahead. This work is referred to in the Bible as a “strange work”, and it is strange to many people. Although Jehovah’s witnesses are opposed on every side, subjected to the most cruel persecution, ridiculed, imprisoned, and even killed, because of their course of action, yet the “strange work” goes on at an amazing pace. In one year alone, 1938, they put out 26,772,882 books containing the Kingdom message. If you want to read the most interesting report of how this was done, get a copy of the 1939 YEAR BOOK OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES.

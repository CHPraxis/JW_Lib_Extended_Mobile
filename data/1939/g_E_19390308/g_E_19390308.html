<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Death of the Spanish Republic</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ambrose Ratti, generally known as IfeA M; Pope Pius XI,</span><span class="font5">* head of the Italian</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Camorra operating out of Vatican City, succeeded before his death in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*“ destroying the Spanish Republic, after accomplishing similar work as respects the republics of Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Danzig. To his achievements may also be added the destruction of Ethiopia and the imminent destruction of China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Make no mistake, the war in Spain originated with the pope. It was his war. The men he used to accomplish the ruin of Spain were all professed Catholics, as Juan March, Hitler, Mussolini, Daladier, and Franco, or were sympathetic with (jnd in subservience to the Hierarchy, as is the case with Chamberlain and Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco used the Moors, traditional enemies of Spain, in accomplishing the ruin of the republic, and Franco had the pope’s “blessing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope made it plain on July 29, 1938, that there arc no serious differences between himself and the Fascist dictators when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now there is someone who has affirmed that between Catholic Action and the Fascist party there is an unbridgeable doctrinal divergence. Big words are these, but crazy words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A dispatch from Rome, published in the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font5"> of July 22, 1938, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Press in the democratic countries is inclined to jump to somewhat exaggerated conclusions when the pope speaks out with force against certain ’Judge Rutherford did not name Pope Pius XI personally in his address at London, September 11, 1938, and hence to his successor now applies the warning then given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today you stand before the judgment scat of Christ, the great Judge of the world. According to the undisputed facts you arc convicted out of your own mouth, and the Lord’s final judgment hns been entered against you and you are going to die. (See the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font4"> page 23.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tendencies in Italian Fascism. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The pope condemns </span><span class="font4">Fascism” headline of many English newspapers this week has caused much annoyance here [in Rome]. It is an entirely misleading interpretation of the Holy Father’s words on “the curse of extreme nationalism”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell, of Malaga, Spain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The war in Spain is an attempt on the part of the people of Spain to defend the decencies of life, the possibilities of education and their hope for the future, which they have won at an election, from a violent and greedy set of Spanish oppressors who want to get all their old privileges back again. And these oppressors are backed by the might of German and Italian armies. To my mind, the Spanish people are fighting your battle and my battle for the freedom of humanity, and in their fight their greatest enemy has been the policy of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony of Catholic Priests</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ggrr</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;Ramon Ugarte, Catholic priest,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">pastor of the parochial church of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■C &nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Maria de San Sebastian,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spain, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;’’■* Our war [of the Spanish Republic to put down the Franco rebellion J is not a religious war nor an ideological war; it is a monstrous war imposed upon the Spanish worker by a bunch of traitors to their country, which they have sold shamefully to preserve their iniquitous privileges to exploit the people. Traitors and perjurers, vile assassins, Pharisees whom, if Jesus were to come again to the world, He would drive away from the Temple, not at the crack of the whip, but kicking them out!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Pope of Peace” was without compassion for Basques, Catalonians, Ethiopians, Chinese or the common people of any land, but was interested only in the maintenance of the most ungodly racket beneath the sun. There has been much palaver about his “saintliness”, and his prospects of a place in heaven or “purgatory”. He lias none, and the world, though well rid of him, is no better off with bis successor in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another priest, Michael O’Flanagan, of Dublin, Ireland, upon his return from that war-racked land, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a totalitarian state is one of the most hateful things in the world, a totalitarian church is more hateful still. The Church has often proved itself to be a very unreliable leader in political affaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don Jose Bcrgamin, director of the Catholic review </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cruz</span><span class="font5"> y </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Raya,</span><span class="font5"> summed up the Spanish situation as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cast yoar eyes for one moment on that tragic pyramid of grotesques: generals, bishops, Moors, Carlists in red berets—they are like some fantastic mumming-show of Death. They entrust the defense of their Spain to Moors and soldiers of the Foreign Ix?gion, for they have no Spanish hands and bodies to defend themselves. This is the truth of Spain in these bloody hours. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font4"> are the Spaniards: they arc a handful of traitors with some thousands of barbarian mercenaries at their command, with some weapons of war bought on credit out of the spoils to which they would reduce our land. And in these they put their trust, or rather their desperation. By such barbarians some of the dignitaries of our church seek to defend their impostures—dignitaries of the Church which they have taken from the people, which they have corrupted, prostituted, shamed with avarice and spotted with our blood, the blood of the Spanish people. Listen to this, if you are listening to me, unfaithful shepherds, traitors to Christ! Yon have placed in the barbarous hands of Legionaries and Moors the sacred vessels, the riches and treasure which you never offered to your people, the poor, the disinherited, the hungry. And you either give these things as sacrilegious booty, or to convert them into weapons dealing death to your people and your flock. I know you well, bishops who dabble in politics, who chatter of politics. Listen well; for this is an accusation which I make. You, the dignitaries of the Spanish church, have betrayed that church, and have robbed the people I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1928 there were 32,001 priests in Spain. In 1936 the “Rebels” asserted that 17,500 of them had been slain. Later Cardinal Goma said the number slain was more than 10,000. In the last pastoral letter of the Spanish bishops they stated that the number slain was 6,000, and the facts show that most of these (possibly an actual 3,000) were slain while fighting as common soldiers against the government, the object of their conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Earth's Most Gifted Liars</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">« The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font5"> organ of the Vatican, cheerfully said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Teruel, twenty-seven of the sixty-five priests on January sixth [1938] were murdered by Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then the Spanish Republic supplied the information that four of the number Mere being held in officers’ quarters in Barcelona, twenty-two were held in the military barracks in Valencia, and the twenty-seventh had died in a military’ hospital. The only reason that any' of the priests were confined was their illegal activities against the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Jiving the lie to the oft-repeated stories of persecutions of priests in the Spanish Republic, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gerald Tribune</span><span class="font5"> carried a dispatch from Barcelona, the then capital, that on October 17 priests walked the streets in robes and the other funny-looking things they like to wear, while the people in general tipped their hats and soldiers gave the military salute. But so long as there was any chance of a victory for Franco, the Hierarchy continued to send out stories of persecution, so as to get the public sympathy necessary to the continuation of their racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.On July 22, 1938, 28 Spanish nuns landed in England after being in Madrid and Barcelona for over two years of the civil war. They denieel that they had suffered any’ special hardships or ill treatment ou account of being nuns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the intention of the Spanish Republic that, in the event of final success for the Loyalists, Spain should become a refuge for the oppressed of German lands, whether Catholic, Protestant or Jewish, and a proclamation to that effect was issued. What a rebuke this was to the murderers, liars and traitors that brought about the defeat and destruction of the republic and dashed the hopes of the Spanish people for better conditions to the ground!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Loyalist government of Spain carefully protected Spanish art treasures, many of them of ecclesiastical significance. Arrangements were made with the League to hold these in safekeeping until the conclusion of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lawrence Fernsworth, American newspaper correspondent in Spain, showed further the good intentions of the government:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">-phis brings ns to the religious phase of the situation here. A great deal of poison has been spread abroad in an effort to make people believe that this is an anti-God government having as one of its main purposes the crushing of religion. Sectarian periodicals have published and repeated that “the government has liquidated the priests”. I have gone deeply into the facts—they would affect me profoundly if they were true. But I find no evidence to support the charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Barcelona today there are living some 2,000 priests, in Madrid some 900, in other cities and towns others in proportion. I know of anarchists who saved the lives of priests, and I know of atheists who sheltered priests in their homes to guard them from harm. All this contrasts oddly with the statements that “not one priest remains in Madrid”, or in Barcelona or some other city, as the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am told by an investigator, himself a Catholic priest, that not more than 80 priests were killed in Madrid. That is bad enough, but they are only a fraction of many others who suffered in those days of turbulence and chaos. Those sworn to uphold the government and law and order abandoned it, turned traitors, and for some months anarchic disorder reigned until the government, fighting for its life at Madrid, could establish law and order again, as now it has done. That is the long and short of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The government has offered every facility for the re-establishment of religious worship. Protestant churches have been open for months; Catholic churches have not opened except for some chapels, particularly one in Barcelona, which is freely open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The government has gone strictly upon the theory that since there exists a constitutional separation of Church and State, it is not for the government to open churches. Catholics, if they wish their services, must open their own churches and the government will protect them. But the sad fact must be recorded that Catholics have not yet opened churches because of systematic obstruction on the part of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Few, if any, are sympathetic to the government even though receiving its protection. Most of them are waiting for the arrival of Franco. “They are more interested in having a pretext for murmuring against the government than in accepting its protection and good will,” one of the priests loyal to the government told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These priests still take the view, as manifested by the bishop of Terue) at the time of his capture, that this is a “holy war”, in which the main issue is the church. It has been one of the great misfortunes of Spain that the church has insisted upon making itself the main issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Pedro Lecuona. minister counselor, Spanish embassy, Washington, D. C., stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be interesting to know whether Mgr. Antoniutti knows that Franco has shot 13 priests, imprisoned 117, and exiled 135 in the Basque country; that the bishops in the Rebel zone do not raise their arms to bestow benedictions but to make the Fascist salute; that they celebrate mass on altars in which instead of having a holy image, they have the arrows of the Spanish Fascist emblem (the veracity of this can be proved with photographs); that on the altars of certain churches of San Sebastian and Bilbao there are to be found large portraits of Franco; that the parish priests </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font4">of the Basque country have informed the Vatican that the people remain absent from church as a protest against the attitude adopted by the greater part of the Hierarchy toward the Spanish civil war; that there are many, many Mohammedans who Franco claims are fighting for the Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New Orleans </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font5"> of January 21, 1939, carried an article by Roy Mouton, who served in Spain as a volunteer, in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. The most lying kind of propaganda has been launched against the Spanish people. I am a Catholic; I went to mass over and over again. There is no interference with the church. And all of that cry about “Communism” is a smoke-screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No attempt will be made here to review all the events of the Spanish Civil War. Mention is made only of some of the more recent engagements.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">During the siege of Madrid not only were the 1,300,000 inhabitants supplied with sufficient food, but 3,000 babies were bom. The road to Valencia was kept open and supplies continued to arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many wonder how the Spanish Republic, cut in half by Franco’s army, eould have continued to function as long as it did. Mails were carried between the two parts by submarine. Steamship and air-mail service were also maintained. Only the railway and highway communications were cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the assault on Teruel, 400 Fascist airplanes staged the world’s greatest air battle. The German and Italian planes used were described as new ones, spreading death and destruction for all the daylight hours, and dumping 1,500-pound aerial torpedoes on their objectives below. The destruction spread to villages fifteen miles behind the battle front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A British commission which examined the city of Alicante after a scries of air raids by the rebel forces found that eighty bombs had been dropped within a certain time, but not one of these fell within a quarter of a mile of any military objective and that the only conclusion possible is that the raids were deliberate attacks upon civilians or else were conducted by persons unskilled in air raids, which is doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Spanish Rebel General Yague made an address at Lerida, Spain, in which he complimented the courage of the Spanish Loyalist soldiers and said that the German and Italian soldiers in the Rebel ranks conducted themselves like birds of prey. He thought that per-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">haps some day a reunited Spanish people would fight both the Germans and Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Protestants pressed the pope to say something to Franco deploring the bombing of civilians in Spain, but it must have been understood between them that what he then said was to go in one ear and out of the other; for it had not the least effect</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Massacres of Majorca</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a new book by Georges Ber-nanos, a French Catholic writer, he tells of his experiences on the island of Majorca: how he greeted the arrival of the first Italian airplane without displeasure, but how, finally, his eyes were opened to the horrors of Fascism as he saw the mass executions, 3,000 in a few months, in a small island, with a peaceful agricultural population who had never had much to do with politics. He declares that all suspects were dragged out of their houses at night and massacred; not a sick or wounded person was spared; sometimes the massacres took place in the presence of a priest; appearances were carefully preserved; no one was allowed to wear mourning; no shops were closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies,</span><span class="font5"> in its issue of January 19, carried a dispatch in which it is stated that refugees, gathered in the main square of Santa Coloma de Queralt, were machine-gunned by Franco’s men. The town was subsequently recaptured by the Loyalists and so the trut h got out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">October 7, 1938, to get a good name for himself. Franco caused 345.000 packets of cigarettes and 250 tons of bread to be dropped on Barcelona and Madrid. He hoped thereby to weaken the resistance of those two important centers of Loyalist Spain. The day previous he had dropped 2,500 pounds of high-explosive bombs on Pnlamos and four incendiary bombs. The Loyalist government reciprocated the bread and cigarette maneuver by dropping tons of stockings, shirts and other wearing apparel in Burgos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dipeche de Toulouse,</span><span class="font5"> one of the most influential newspapers in France, reported that Franco sent enormous quantities of American wheat to Germany in exchange for munitions.

<p><span class="font5">After the capture of Barcelona the rebel conquerors celebrated an outdoor victory mass in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was great rejoicing at Rome over the Barcelona victory of the “Spanish rebels”. The former king and queen of Spain, whose marriage, after many years of married life, was declared void by the pope, wore there at a “solemn mass”, and so was Vladimir Lcdoehowsky, superior general of the Jesuits. Just a “coincidence”, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jerry J. O’Connell, liberty-loving representative from Montana, wanted justice done for Spain. Although O'Connell is a Roman Catholic, and even though his meeting was picketed by Catholics hostile to his stand, he boldly addressed 6,500 people at Pittsburgh, protesting against the Spanish embargo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The embargo against the Spanish Republic would have been lifted early in May, and the agreement to do so bail already been formed by Secretary Hull and his advisers, when word came from Roosevelt, then fishing in the Caribliean, to wait until he got back. It seems that the Roman Hierarchy turned the heat on him and, as usual, he went along with the great enemy of democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bringing Hypocrisy into the Open</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">j&amp;Sy</span><span class="font5"> Bringing the hypocrisy of the so-called “Non-Intervention” pow-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L'‘</span><span class="font5"> ers into the open, the prime min-_’<sup>stcr</sup> Spain, Dr. Negrin, announced at the League of Nations that the Spanish Republican Government had ordered the immediate withdrawal of all non</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Spanish combatants fighting on the Government side, and asked for the immediate appointment of an international commission by the League of Nations to sec that this was done. The very same paper that announced this courageous stand also announced that Italy was sending fresh troops to Franco. Negrin claims that if the Moors. Italians and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germans had been withdrawn from Spain the Republicans could have re-established order in three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States may send munitions to any country that needs them, except Spain. The reason it could not send them to Spain was that it would offend the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is the power behind the Franco-Moorish-German-Italian attack. Mexico has no such scruples and recently filled a ship full of munitions for the Spanish Republic, and followed that with a large order of munitions for Mexico, placed with makers in the United States. Miss Dorothy Thompson, noted columnist, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A legitimate, friendly government has the right to buy from us in the markets of the world whatever she needs for her defense against rebellion. That is a principle of international practice which the American government has stood for from the beginning of her history. Our historic tradition has been on the side of not only selling arms to friendly governments, but of preventing arms’ going to rebels against which such friendly governments were struggling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Italian Non( ? ^Intervention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ambroglio Barlatti, in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It Mediterraneo,</span><span class="font5"> explained Italy’s interest in the Spanish Civil War, when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is time that the Spanish war be recognized as a continuation of the Abyssinian campaign. We must impose our influence on the Spaniards so that the Mediterranean may become the Italian Jake of which Mussolini has spoken. </span><span class="font5">In view of the fact that Italy was officially at peace with Spain, it was rather interesting that the Italian government published the information that since the war began in Spain Italian fliers shot down 580 airplanes. In April, 1938, the Italian fliers dropped 291 tons of explosives on their Spanish neighbors; in May, 431 tons; and in June, 719 tons. The Italian government was -one of the governments on the Non-Intervention Committee, supposed to be struggling to bring about peace in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Spanish Government reported the return to Italy of 10.000 Italian soldiers and the immediate replacement of 4,549 sent to Spain in 16 ships, details of the names of the ships and the number of men on each ship were given. The Republic estimated that after this exchange the Italians still had in Spain 900 pilots, 2,000 aviation mechanics, 10,000 chauffeurs, 5,000 engineers, 10,000 la-</span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">borers, 2,000 secret police, 1,000 army service men, and 60,000 soldiers, making in all about 91,000 men. [Condensed from a Barcelona dispatch by Herbert L. Matthews in the New York rimes.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to the fall of Barcelona 2,928 out of some 50,000 Italian soldiers in Spain had been killed. Undoubtedly Mussolini expects that his investment of men and money in Spain is going to yield returns to Italy that will justify the lavish expenditures. The rebel victory undoubtedly increases Italian prestige and power considerably. British statesmen, however, continue to hope that they will be able to offset Mussolini's influence in Spain by means of loans to Franco, who will not be in position to ignore Britain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that there had been no square deal intended for Spain, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is two years since the foreign invasion of Spain began. It has taken that time for the Powers to produce even a pajier scheme that might give the Spanish Government not a square deal, for nothing so absurd is contemplated, but a deal less crooked than that which has brought it within sight of defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco the Butcher discloses the heart of Fascism (Catholic Action) in his rulings regarding education. Uis so-called “minister of education” closed fifty high schools in the territory under his control, giving as a reason the following strictly Papal principle:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people arc better off without education. It unfits them for their destiny as peasants and workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is rich, for a “minister of education”. And it shows what must inevitably happen in any land that comes under Fascist control. There will be a drying-up of all sources of information for the common people. This drying-up is actually under way in the United States today, when children arc driven away from the public school because they refuse to worship the flag, and when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy conspires to keep Judge Rutherford off the air, and when the newspapers and the movies are so polluted with superstitious Roman Catholic rot that they can hardly’ be seen without nausea. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With respect to Franco’s tentative government setup John V. Hinkel, in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of September 5, 1938, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In its setup the government appears to be totalitarian. Freedom of speech nnd of the press is curtailed under it; commerce and industry are strictly supervised; no political opposition—particularly from the lx&gt;ft—is countenanced; the people are mildly regimented, and there are other earmarks. As perhaps the most influential non-government personage in Nationalist Spain, Cardinal Goma y Tomas, head of the Spanish hierarchy, commands a great deal of res|&gt;ect and attention. The cardinal told the writer that “the spirit of the laws promulgated thus far by the Nationalist government is in complete harmony with the teachings of the church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the traitorous Spanish rebel setup is backed by the Hierarchy to the limit is indicated in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Register,</span><span class="font5"> Catholic paper of central California, of August 21, 1938:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nearly 900 cardinals, archbishops and bishops throughout the world have written letters to Cardinal Goma, primate of Spain, which appear in the book being issued at Burgos, showing the sympathy of world Catholics with the Nationalist cause. Included are collective letters of sympathy from the Hierarchies of the United States, Canada, Britain. Mexico, and other countries. With Vatican approval, the book is being published as a sequel to the 1937 Pastoral Letter of the Spanish Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How things will go is shown by the fact that Franco had a formal inauguration of his regime at Burgos, Spain, December 2, 1937, in which he was enthroned beneath the oldtime arms of King Alphonso’s Spain. He was sworn in with religious rites. The exercises took place in the Roman Catholic church of Huelgas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Franco tribunal at Bilbao sentenced Dr. Pedro Lozano, director of the hospital of Durango, to eleven years’ penal servitude because he continued to look after the patients when the Loyalist forces were in Durango.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The liutcher”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font5"> Franco admits he has a card file of some 2.000,000 persons many of whom will be put to death and the others sentenced to penal servitude. He announced that he will not tolerate any other “Christian religion” in Spain than the Catholic religion, lie concluded a treaty with Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franco will absolutely control the press in Fascist Spain. Orders issued by him regulate the number of papers and reporters and make the newspaper a department of the government, subject to it in every detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cardinal Goma, chief representative of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Spain, fully approves Franco’s course of action. He said: </span><span class="font4">A regime of i&gt;crfcct accord between the Church and the State must be established, since the former must intervene on many issues. 1 am happy to be able to tell you that up to now we are in complete agreement with the Nationalist government, which, on the other hand, never takes a step without consulting inc and obeying me. The representative of the minister of justice will bear me out in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jacinto Benaventc, Spain’s greatest living writer and Nobel prize winner, points out the connection between Fascism and the Inquisition, and shows that no good may be hoped for with the Hierarchy in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have never hesitated. From the very first moment I put myself on the side of the victim against the hangman, and 1 will continue fighting on the side of the people until the end. Fascism, I am sure, is the bloody child of the Inquisition. It takes possession of labor to exploit it; of heroism to debase it; of glory to soil it; of thought to prostitute it</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">IN READING your magazine I have come to the conclusion that it represents one of the greatest weapons against Fascism in this nation. Such a weapon is badly needed, and should be made as far as possible the medium of the freedom-loving Americans for the expression of their opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The majority of the nation’s press have steadily veered toward the pro-Faseist elements. But this is not always because of any desire or ulterior motive. We must realize that a publisher is in business for profit. Suppose for a moment that you are such a publisher. You receive, in one week, ten letters upholding democracy and two hundred claiming to, but really upholding Fascism. You know these are pro-Faseist letters, and you refuse to let</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a campaign of this kind bother you. But week after week the stream continues, heaping abuse upon you for not reflecting the true sentiments of the reading public. You begin to veer. The apologists for Fascism take heart and redouble their efforts. You keep on veering, until you reach the stage where you are afraid to let anyone speak to the contrary, no matter how reasonable the arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That, my friend, is the application of an old principle; it was popularized and made easy by Hitler. I let Herr Hitler speak for himself (quoted from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Knmpf)</span><span class="font5">: ‘‘Any statement, carefully and patiently repeated, becomes a truth. Any people, if subjected to a clever and persistent course of propaganda, can be made to think that heaven is hell, and that a life of misery is heaven on earth.” Such a campaign is now being launched, has in fact been launched for some time, in the United States. Editors are being subjected to propaganda, largely unseen by the public. Most of the names behind this propaganda have a strangely similar ring: Conway, Halloran, Murphy, O’Brien, O’Reilly, O’Conncl — O’-WhoNot ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The similarity in names is in itself an evidence of collusion. But this collusion is further testified by the fact that from week to week the arguments are altered, and all of them in precisely the same manner. The arguments, accusations and charges are varied precisely as the official publications of the proFascist groups arc varied. This week you will see that the Spanish elections of 1936 were falsified. Next week you will see a special feature of the villainous ‘‘Reds'’ infiltrating into the now legal government and Paul Revere Franco riding to save the honor of 133,000 officers and 25.000 men, not to mention the royal family. Next you sec Franco in a thrilling serial: in the first part he is a retiring family man with great responsibility thrust upon him ; in the second he is suddenly a great leader ruthlessly facing the necessity of killing (there seems to be part of a reel missing right there) and rallying all the forces of good to save Spain; the third part shows him stemming the tide of “Red” legions, killing 285,000 out of an original 30.000 (how the rabble docs multiply!); the fourth part reveals that he planned it all the time, not against the government, but against those who sought to undermine the government, and that he really would not have stemmed the tide if it <sub>x</sub> had not been for the kindly efforts of loyal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">men of the faith throughout the world, whose great work has changed a hostile press to a sympathetic one (yes, they admit it).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When this campaign touches on the wounded men returning from Spain it reaches the depths of hatred. We were told of this hatred when we left Spain, warned that our every word would be misquoted and that we would not be allowed to find here a haven of peace. We knew that we would have to continue living that war, because we know what Fascism is. The veterans are ridiculed, prevented from speaking at public meetings, charged with being Communists in order to discredit their testimony. They are the objects of hatred, prejudice, conniving, conspiracy, slander and libel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What the friends of Fascism do not realize is this: The men who fought for the liberty of the Spanish people have learned courage and iron discipline. At Jarama they fell in windrows before the attack of tanks and planes, but those who lived gave Franco his first great defeat. From Brihuega they retreated all the way to Guadalajara, then turned to drive the Italian blackshirts thirty kilometers and capture an entire brigade of men. At Caspe they counterattacked without artillery and with their own troops retreating on all sides; they were cited as having, in that action, saved the life of the Catalonian Republic. Those who live are welded into an everlasting brotherhood, a brotherhood tried in fire and pledged to die if necessarv in defense of democracy. They are a powerful force for good, because they have learned the essential qualities of leadership and intelligent thinking. They will fight in good faith with anyone for the preservation of human rights and principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the readers of your magazine want to protect their own rights and guarantee free speech to others who want freedom, they can do nothing better than to write to their local newspapers and the national magazines. They must meet the threat of the pro-Faseist forces by using the weapon used by those forces. If those who love democracy and tolerance v ill only make their presence felt, if they will broach the subject freely to the editors and demand a hearing, some of the press will eventually be open to their point of view. They must exercise unceasing vigilance against the usurping of the freedom of the press through clever conspiracy.—Norman Hawkins, South Dakota.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>United States Air Pilot Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">U7 FLYING in the United States is * X</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">/</span><span class="font5">ji<sup>1</sup>! regulated by the new Civil Aero-nautics Authority, and flyers are examined by inspectors of the Bu-roan. The flyers’ law is the “Civil Air Regulations”, referred to as CAR, and issued by the secretary. These regulations are exacting and voluminous, covering every phase of private and commercial flying activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A written examination on CAR must be passed by applicants for pilot ratings before flight tests are given; therefore the regulations have to be studied in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pilots receive ratings according to ability, which is governed by the number of hours spent in the air, at the controls, and by the weight of the aircraft flown. The greater the weight, the more skill required, and hence the better the rating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some pilot rat ings are: “Student, Solo, Private, Limited Commercial, Commercial, Instructor, Instrument, Glider and Airline.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Types of aircraft are land, sea, single-engine and multi-engine, which types are listed on a pilot’s certificate and to which type the pilot is limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In detail, some of the requirements for a “Private” are that the applicant read, write and speak English, be twenty-one years of age, pass satisfactorily a physical examination before a doctor or doctors appointed by the Bureau, which doctors issue a Student certificate. This physical examination must be submitted to once each year and also after a confining illness or serious injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A minimum of eight hours of dual flight instruction must be taken before a student is permitted to make his first solo hop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next, have thirty-five hours of solo time, which must include practice in maneuvers and five hours of eross-eountry flying. In a logbook the date of flight, time, number of plane, type of plane and engine, and a notation of any damage, if such should occur, must be recorded. This log must be signed by the pilot and attested by a notary public before being submitted to an inspector with an application for the desired rating, which application must also be notarized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two identical photographs, showing head and shoulders, definitely one and one-half by two inches in dimensions, must be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A written examination is then taken on the air traffic rules, meteorology and navigation, which examination successfully passed opens the way for the actual flight test on aeronautical skill. For this test the applicant is required to furnish an airworthy ship of the type required for the rating or weight classification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the applicant has a solo rating and his flight test meets with the approval of the inspector, he immediately receives a temporary “Certificate of Competency”. This is followed sometime later, through the mail, by a permanent certificate and identification eard. On the certificate is specified the weight classification and type, land or sea, single or multi-engine, to which the pilot is limited. The certificate bears a permanent number and, for a Private rating, has to be renewed yearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Renewal of a certificate is accomplished by the pilot’s submitting to physical examination and showing his application for renewal, with certified logbook, to a Bureau inspector. This is for the purpose of proving that the pilot has met the yearly requirements, in flying hours, to hold each rating on each type of aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pilot certificates have been issued to the number of more than forty-four thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Commercial and special ratings are relatively harder to earn than a Private. Private pilot privileges are that he may carry persons or property; but not for hire. He may also earn an Instructor rating after two hundred hours flying time at the controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The physical requirements, and especially that of vision, are very rigid, and must necessarily be so, due to the responsibility and strain of an active pilot’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a common practice for student pilots to rent planes; and average rates for the light or cheaper type, those under 1,000 pounds, are $10 an hour for instruction and $6 an hour for solo time, gas and oil furnished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aircraft must be inspected regularly and carry a &quot;Certificate of Airworthiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Flying is an art; therefore the yearly requirements as to time in the air are necessary to insure that the pilot’s skill is adequate to his trust. An airman flies by feel; which means that through the relative sensitiveness of the controls he knows when the plane is, or is not, in a safe attitude of flight.—Herbert E. Jenkins, New York.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Something About Geese</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Geese are valuable for their eggs, their feathers and down, and their flesh, 80 percent of which is edible. Feathers and down are used for stuffing pillows and mattresses, particularly in Europe. Goose feathers are also used to adorn hats. Geese kept especially for their plumage are plucked four or five times a year. They probably do not enjoy being plucked!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Geese sometimes produce two broods of young in a season, there being about ten young in a brood. They may be eaten three months after they leave the shell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The liver of a fat goose is often very large, larger, in fact, than all the other viscera or “innards”. By special feeding the liver can be made abnormally large. When this is done the object is to use the liver for the making of the well-known </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pate de foie gras</span><span class="font5"> for which Strasbourg, France, is famous, although it doubtless has other claims to distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Farmers in the United States often breed the Gray Toulouse goose. These mature late and are sometimes called “Christmas” geese. They are good egg-layers, though their flesh is not as good as that of some other geese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most profitable geese to keep, fron\the standpoint of many raisers, arc the Gray African geese, which are long-necked and tall, and large-headed. They have a large knob on the base of their bills and are of a gray color, which is darkest on their backs. They are ready for market in a shorter time than most other geese, and do not require a great, deal of labor and time to bring to maturity. They are good layers and have a fine-flavored flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The so-called “Chinese geese” are good, too. They are small and graceful and come in white and brown varieties, lay well, and taste good, when cooked.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ For ten years we have been feeding birds and squirrels, each year receiving new and greater thrills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large covered feeding station, well up off the ground, of which two sides are protected by glass and provided with perches, is the center of most of our activity. The menu consists of sunflower seeds, peanuts, chick feed, bread and cake crumbs, puddings made of </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">melted suet combined with yellow cornmeal and bird gravel, and for an occasional treat we tie doughnuts in the tree branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each morning, gathered around our porch with unfailing regularity, arc nine of the very fattest peanut-fed squirrels imaginable and a number of little red squirrels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bird population at this time includes juneoes, nuthatches, downy and hairy woodpeckers, a pair of cardinals, bluejays, chickadees, an occasional pheasant, three crows (who in extremely cold weather overcome their wariness) and, almost unbelievable, a mockingbird. Whence he came no one seems to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Considered almost strictly a southern bird and not. migratory, his identity puzzled us. Somewhat darker in color than they usually arc, we could scarcely believe we had such a prize until a number of persons who thoroughly understand the study of birds viewed him and positively identified him as a mockingbird, although his powers of ventriloquism should have convinced us before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having been here all winter, through the many changes of weather, dependent on us for food, he has become very tame, submitting to close scrutiny with binoculars and calmly concentrating upon his food while people stand within a few feet of the feeding station, so certain is he that he has found sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thrill of thrills, shortly before last week’s storm when it was almost as black as night, he burst into as magnificent a song as I have ever heard, thus more surely establishing his identity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nigerian Daily Times,</span><span class="font5"> Lagos, Nigeria, contains the equivalent of four columns of news about the convention of over 300 of Jehovah’s witnesses held in that West African city. Tw.o of the conventioners traveled over 500 miles on bicycle to attend. “Sandwich boards” were used to advertise the public meeting. It was a great blessing to the eon-ventioners to hear Judge Rutherford’s lectures by phonograph in their own native tongue, Yoruba. There were 800 at the public lecture; 63 of whom were immersed. Some 3,000 pamphlets in Yoruba were placed in the hands of the people, and more would have been put out except for a heavy downpour characteristic of that part of the world. What a blessing to see the message of Jehovah’s kingdom, man’s only hope, being widely spread over all Africa and over all the civilized world!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A certain damsel with Israelitish features, apparently German, and who refused to give us her name, appeared in our editorial office to tell us that she felt she had been referred to in a paragraph appearing in one of our former issues and which bore the same heading as this.

She also said that she had not been called to the Investigations Bureau under suspicion of espionage; so the agents had told her.

<p><span class="font5">♦ When Jesus was on earth He taught His disciples to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. . . .’ Indeed, the kingdom of heaven constituted the chief theme of Jesus’ ministry on earth. It was a strange doctrine to the Jew religionists whose allegiance belonged to the Romans. It was an incomprehensible Utopia where men dwell together in peace and contentment; where wars and famine arc unknown and men love their fellow creatures even as themselves; where hatred and ill will are not to be found and God’s will is the law supreme. A kingdom where men are never sick and one need never die. A rule that honors God and magnifies His illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men with faith in Jehovah believed in the kingdom of heaven. They fervently prayed for this glorious time with complete faith in every promise concerning it. Not all were so blessed as to live in “that day” when Jehovah’s King is fully enthroned. This alone makes the present day most unique! Jehovah’s kingdom has come. It is here: a living reality! Daily the lives of the Lord’s people are crowded with events that concern the Kingdom interests. Daily Jehovah’s witnesses bear testimony to the onward march of the great King of kings. Even while the enemy’s structure is crumbling in complete disintegration Jehovah exalts Ilis King upon the heights. Daily the Kingdom is thrown into conflict with the remaining members of the Devil's agents in the earth. Daily the kingdom of God is presenter! to all who accept it. Daily WBBR rejoices in the mounting evidences that the Kingdom is here. This is Kingdom news. This sort of news is what thrills the hearts of all who have placed their hopes in the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WBBR is pleased to announce that with the beginning of the special </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, January 1, it inaugurated a series of weekly programs devoted to Kingdom news: interesting items gleaned from the field affecting the Kingdom interests throughout the world as reported to the Watch Tower organization and which appear in “New Government” section and elsewhere in every issue of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine: field experiences re-enacted before the microphone; court records pertaining to the witness work unfolded in living sequence.

It is best not to grease pan, but bake slowly until browned, and then turn over with spatula or pancake turner. About five minutes for each side of a panful is about right. They will rise while baking, making them just right to split and eat with butter or honey. May be eaten hot or cold. Baking without grease makes them better to digest. Will keep a few days.— Mrs. F.

<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Petition</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font5">ARLY in the year 1938 a company of some two hundred clergymen presented to the president of the United States a paper in the form of a petition “for a return to God, home and country” and requested the president to “make any suggestion of ways and means by which we and our brethren in the ministry can be of the highest value to our day and generation” about returning to God, home and country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems strange that anyone who even pretends to serve God and Christ should appeal to an outstanding politician as to how he can return to God. Such a course is what the Scriptures designate as ‘going down to Egypt [the world] for help’. Those clergymen, by their petition to the president, plainly show that they have forgotten God and ignored His Word, and the Lord declares woe shall be their lot. “Woe to them that go down to Egypt [the political ruling power of the world] for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots [horses and chariots symbolically standing for war equipment and an organization to carry on war], because they are many; and in horsemen [the men who manipulate the political and commercial warfare], because they are very strong; but they [the clergymen or religious leaders] look not unto the Holy One of Israel [God’s organization], neither seek the Lord!” The Lord then declares what He will do to such, saying lie “will arise against the house of the evil doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity”. (Isaiah 31:1-3) By their words addressed to the president as set forth in their petition those religious leaders show that they have completely forgotten God and His Word and that they are floundering about seeking help from any source. Truly they are, as Jesus said, blind guides of the blind. What does God say shall be the end of those who forget Him and His Word? “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Psalm 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words of the clergymen’s petition clearly imply that those religionists at one time </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8. 1939 </span><span class="font5">had some faith in God and in the blood of His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, by which man is redeemed from death. Now they have fallen away from God and have lost faith in His Word and in His great arrangement for redemption. Under such circumstances, then, can they hope to “return to God”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The higher critics among religionists have taken the Iqad in repudiating the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and the majority of the religionists have acquiesced in such repudiation and have turned to the world for help and follow a worldly course. What does the Word of God say about such returning to Him? The answer is found in the following text: “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh in the rain I hat cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.” (Hebrews 6:4-8) And what will be the result to those credulous persons who continue to blindly follow such religious teachers who have substituted tradition for the Word of God and who continue to teach the people tradition, and not the Scriptures? Jesus said of such religious leaders: “This people draw-eth nigh unto me with their mouth, and hon-oureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:8,9) Then turning to His disciples and the others who were listening Jesus said concerning those religionists: “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And, if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”—Matthew 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only possible way to find God and Christ Jesus and to walk in God’s way of salvation is for a person to consecrate himself to Jehovah God, fully and completely trusting in the merit of Christ Jesus’ sacrifice, and to study the Word of God and obey His commandments. By so doing he follows in the footsteps of Jesus, the great righteous One and Savior of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses now go about the land from house to house and call the attention of the people to the Scriptures, which give the very instruction they most need. While the religious leaders flounder about and try to find help from worldly politicians, let the sincere people of the land who love God and Christ and who want to walk in righteousness devote themselves to the Lord and to the careful study of 11 is Word, which is their sure and perfect guide.-—Psalm 119:105.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Even before Group Health Association had begun operation of its clinic, the local Medical Society and the American Medical Association made public attacks upon the ethics of the Association and upon its legality and its financial soundness. At the same time the Medical Society began expulsion proceedings against the Association’s doctors; these proceedings were based upon charges of “unethical” conduct, although the doctors’ only offense had been their willingness to serve the Association. Expulsion of the Association’s doctors was sought not only from the Medical Society of the District of Columbia, but also from other medical societies affiliated with the American Medical Association in other parts of the nation. The proceedings against one of the Association’s doctors were carried to a conclusion and the doctor was expelled. Proceedings against another doctor are still pending. An effort was also made to secure the expulsion of a Washington specialist who had disregarded the Society’s edict by engaging in professional relations with a Group Health Association doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A striking example of the restrictions placed upon Group Health Association’s doctors in securing consultations with other Washington physicians occurred in the case of a patient suffering from a serious heart ailment. The consulting specialist was instructed by an officer of the Medical Society that he could not consult with the attending Association physician. It was, therefore, necessary for the patient to see the specialist alone and for the specialist to communicate his conclusions to the Group Health Association doctor by correspondence. In other instances Group Health Association checks have been rejected by Washington consultants because of fear of the Medical Society’s attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The close relationship existing between the Medical Society and the principal hospitals </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">in Washington has resulted in denial to Group Health Association’s physicians of access to hospital facilities in the District of Columbia. Not even in emergency cases are these doctors allowed to attend their patients. For example, an Association member earning $1,440 a year recently’ telephoned the Association’s surgeon at midnight and reported that her husband had been taken to a Washington hospital with acute appendicitis, and requested that the surgeon come to the hospital immediately to take charge of the case. The hospital declined to permit the Association surgeon to operate, notwithstanding the fact that the member had desired this surgeon’s services and had paid for them through her membership in the Association. The member, therefore, was compelled to incur heavy surgical and hospital expenses that she would not have needed to contract for if the Association had been permitted to carry out, without interference, its agreement with her. She also was denied the right to have the doctor of her own choice attend to the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The evidence revealed by the present investigation appears to warrant submission to a grand jury for such action as that body may determine to be necessary. Such a course is in line with the ordinary practice of the Department when it has information indicating that there have been violations of the criminal provisions of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[The foregoing official statement by the United States Government indicates to some degree the disfavor into which the American Medical Association has fallen because of its intolerable arrogance, selfishness and assumption of an infallibility which is on a par with the infallibility of the pope —equally absurd—equally irritating.—£’&lt;/.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Smokers occasionally go blind from the effect of the nicotine on the optic nerve. Such a case occurred in Kansas City, Mo., with a 17-year-old boy. The doctors exhausted their ingenuity to find out why this young man had lost his sight, but when he lit a cigarette one of them happened to remember what all should know. The young man was restrained from smoking any more cigarettes. In three days there was an improvement in his condition, and in a week or so his full sight returned. If you wish to go blind you might try cigarette smoking.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Did you know that a Catholic priest here sent letters to all the Protestant pastors, as well as to all priests, when the convention was here, demanding that they denounce Jehovah’s witnesses from the pulpits? and so far as I know, they did so. My sister and I were so wrought up over it, and I have not entered a church since. She would not either if it were not that she needs the little income she gets from it as an organist, but I believe that will not hold out long.

Religion is the slimiest racket of all; and if there are some that don’t just quite see the point, well, just listen to this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently it was my privilege to work with a number of Jehovah’s witnesses publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Uis kingdom on a Saturday afternoon witnessing party (we call them “concentrations” in Portuguese). My territory assignment happened to be made up of small business houses and retail stores completely surrounding a large Catholic church building and a plaza. In this territory were . about a dozen stores which deal in religious ware exclusively, such as candles, rosary beads, images, crucifixes, etc. I noticed in each of these stores a very large array of waxen objects such as human heads, hands, fingers, noses, eyes, female breasts, legs, feet, toes, the torso, hearts, and, in fact, every imaginable part of the anatomy, internal and external. Among all these were also figures of horses, cows, mules, chickens, ducks, etc. Having been brought up a Roman Catholic in the United States and never having seen the like before, my curiosity was aroused, and here is the answer to my inquiry,—very simple and easy to follow indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us suppose that you have contracted some serious ailment or disease in any organ or part of your make-up. You first, of course, seek medical aid and you are informed that you are in bad shape. Your next move is what ? Why, as easy as pie. Don’t be alarmed; just pick out your favorite “saint” and make a promise with the understanding that, if he or she cures your affliction, you will present the said “saint” with an exact duplicate of the afflicted organ or anatomy. Now head straight for the nearest one of these shops and plank down the long green for the waxen object that resembles the part of your body that is affected or you think needs fixing. The amount you pay ranges from 5 or 10 milreis ($.30 or $.60 U.S. coin) to 20 or 30 milreis and upward, according to the particular part of your structure. |See 1 Samuel 5:12; 6: 5.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So far, so good. Now what next ? Well, just carry your “head” or “lieart” or whatever ails you to the nearest “church” and inside you will find a specially constructed box to receive the same. Now go on home and rest easily if possible and wait until your “saint” gets on the job. If it happens that your mule or duck is the victim, make it as comfortable as possible for it until the “saint” gets around to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where do the priests come in on this racket? Why bring that up? Well, follow closely if you must know. You see the candle factories make candles and waxen figures and objects aforementioned. The priests buy the stuff in job lots. Is the light beginning to flicker through? No? The priests then sell in wholesale lots to the shops, who, in turn, retail to you. You deliver at the “church”, and when the box is full the priest ships (?) said box to the factory to be melted and made up into other organs or donkeys, etc., whatever the market is in demand for. Simple, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How about the doctor you engaged prior to al! this? Why, that is easily explained by the priest. If you recover from your ailment, the “saint” takes the honors. If you don’t, well, poor old Doc gets the blame. One thing that isn’t quite clear is why the Sam Hill the “saints” don’t put up a howl, and why permit the priests to rob them of their collection of waxen pigs and other things. On the other hand, what they were to do with them after they did get them was not explained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The wayfarer is suddenly advanced upon by a python that doesn’t eare where he came from and a crocodile that is overly anxious to appease his hunger. Next the wayfarer “planks” his knees on the ground and does some “tall” praying.

<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Hierarchical Courtesy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the controversy over the arms embargo was at its height. Archbishop Michael J. Curley, of Baltimore, called the Spanish ambassador a common, ordinary liar, when that gentleman invited Catholic leaders to visit Spain and prove for themselves that the Spanish government was not against the Catholic religion, but adhered to the fundamental principles of religious tolerance and freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholics in Philadelphia (as well as millions elsewhere) were urged to back the embargo, and 750,000 petitions were circulated. Holy Name Societies, Knights of Columbus and other Catholics sent upward of 100.000 telegrams to Washington in favor of the continuation of the embargo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The much-touted, Fascistic radio priest, Coughlin, generally at superficial odds with the rest of the Hierarchy, also urged the continuation of the arms embargo. Ilis fans sent thousands of telegrams to Congress, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Says Leo II. Lehman in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic: </span><span class="font4">A citizens’ committee, composed of representatives of business, the professions, labor and churches, beaded by Arthur Wald, dean of Augustana College and Theological Seminary, Rock Island. Illinois, rented the ballroom of the Harper House Hotel for a meeting at which a distinguished Spanish delegation was-to speak. The rental of the hall was paid in advance, tickets were printed and placed on sale and advance publicity and advertising announced the meeting to the public. The press was generous in its co-operation, and Radio Station WHBF. owned by the Rock Island </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Argus, </span><span class="font4">offered to broadcast without charge three five-minute talks on the Spanish situation, and arranged an interview over the radio with the delegation. But on the Sunday following the announcement of the meeting, the Catholic bishop of Peoria delivered a sermon denouncing the meeting and condemned the Spanish government as Communistic. Sermons in a similar vein were delivered from local Catholic pulpits, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Messenger </span><span class="font4">joined in the campaign against the delegation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an immediate result, the news' Vl papers closed down on space. Radio u &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Station WHBF canceled the remain-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ry/W/ ing addresses, explaining that it had to ' do so because of protests. The contract for the ballroom of the Harper House was canceled. The citizens’ committee then succeeded in obtaining the assembly room at the Hotel Fort Armstrong, only to have that contract also canceled the following day. With but one day left to get a ball, the committee turned to the Labor Temple. Arrangements were made for the use of the Temple through the Rock Island Bank and Trust Company, which held a mortgage on the building. Again the rental was paid in advance. The following morning, the day of the scheduled meeting, the bank withdrew its consent. It was almost noon before the committee found what proved to be its last stand — un old abandoned chureh. a small wooden structure in an advanced stage of disrepair, far from the center of town. It was owned by a Rock Island physician not amenable to Catholic Church pressure. The afternoon was devoted to cleaning up the hall and preparing it for the meeting. At six o’clock the committee was informed by the chief of police that the meeting had Ixt-n forbidden by the mayor. Later, he revoked the order anti the meeting proceeded. The Spanish delegation, however, declined to attend, declaring that they would not make a public appearance in a community showing such organized antagonism to the government they represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two hundred and fifty Protestant and Jewish clergymen, including seven bishops, urged President Roosevelt to lift the embargo, and 250.000 telegrams with a similar request poured into Washington in the course of a week. The embargo was not lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gallup poll showed that public sympathy in America was with the Spanish Loyalists. 76 percent. Of Catholics, 42 percent favored the Loyalists; and of Protestants, 83 percent.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>The Terror in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN THE last few weeks Europe has been swept by a storm, politically speaking, which was undoubtedly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span class="font5"> the greatest crisis since the Great ' War; so I thought you would be interested to receive a few observations from a pioneer in France. The people in this country were certainly badly frightened; in some parts it was like a return of the war days, with soldiers thronging the railway stations, while, particularly in eastern France, near the German frontier, the roads were busy with military lorries transporting troops and supplies toward the frontier, while civilian cars retreated in the opposite direction, loaded with people and household goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “big four” who met at Munich received a lot of praise and “back-patting” as a result of this meeting. To me it seemed like a lot of bluff; they make it seem as if war were inevitable, strike panic into the hearts of the poor, ignorant people, calmly hand over a chunk of someone clse’s country to the robberin-chief, and then all four stick out the chest and say, “We’ve saved the peace.” As we know, they have only to go on ‘saving the peace’ like that a little longer and ‘sudden destruction shall come upon them’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now there are signs that the Munich quartet is going to strike while the iron is hot. In France, Premier Daladier, in his speech ' to the Chambre des Communes, said, “All French people who desire the safety of France must now consider themselves in a state of permanent mobilization for the service of peace and the country.” He also gives a warning that “everything that arouses hatred, everything that causes divisions among the French people, can now only be considered as treachery”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a brief notice in the French press to the effect that Viscount Buchmaster introduced a motion to the House of Lords in England, saying, “In the light of recent events this House is of the opinion that a sort of military service would be serving the best interests of the country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here arc two signs that what Judge Rutherford said at that marvelous London convention about totalitarianism’s seizing control of Europe is already developing.

<p><span class="font5">struggle to a conclusion; that is, if Germany really sees in the extermination of France a means of providing her people with the necessary room for expansion. There arc 80 million Germans in Europe today. Our policy will be recognized as the correct one, when, in less than one hundred years from now, the continent of Europe is inhabited by 250 million Germans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We want-arms again. Yes, to arouse this cry in the German people the Treaty of Versailles can be used. In the boundlessness of its suppression, in the shamelessness of its demands . . . lies the greatest propagandist weapon for the resurrection of the slumbering animal spirits of a nation. To be sure, from the child’s primer to the last newspaper, every theater, every cinema, every kiosk, and every free hoarding, has to be put in the service of this single great vision, till the smallest boy is repeating the glowing prayer: “Almighty God, some day bless our arms. Be as just as you always were. Judge whether we deserve freedom now.

This, in turn, is only a few hundred miles from Winnipeg on its west and Montreal on the south. Down through this great funnel, every fall, fly thirty percent of all the wild geese hatched in the Arctic. In the fall of 1938, for some unknown reason, there were almost no young geese in the great flock flying south. The reason why the wild geese breed in the Arctic is that they can be free from molestation by their cruel enemy, man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Asked if there were anything the president </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">could do to prevent interference with free speech in .Jersey City, Roosevelt said it was a matter for local police. Asked if there were anything he could do as head of the Democratic party toward ousting Hague as vicechairman of the national committee, the president referred correspondents to the national Democratic chairman, Postmaster General James A.

<p><span class="font5">If he made any such statement, it is surely strange language for a president to use. At the same time the average citizen can but get a kick out of Roosevelt’s speech over the radio wherein he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000 a day, who has been turning his employees over to the government relief rolls in order to preserve his company’s undistributed reserves, tell you—using his stockholders’ money to pay the postage for his personal opinions—that a wage of $11 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>The Germ Theory of Disease</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">WHEN the Germ theorist asserts that pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid fever and meningitis are caused by germs, and the Biocheinic theorist declares that germs have nothing to do with the causation of the above-named diseases, then it is time for citizens to examine the foundation of each theory, and support the one which appeals more strongly to their hard, common sense. The study and classification of germs belong to the science of bacteriology, and as this science was placed on a practical basis only about the year 1880, it is in age only an infant, with an infant’s vagaries and illusions. Analytical chemistry is a more exact science than bacteriology; its history extends over centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two main points upon which the germ theory is founded arc: (1) the presence of different germs with different diseases; (2) that disease follows the hypodermic injection of germs beneath the skin of small animals. (Some tests have been made on humans, but the result was not conclusive.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you ask when germs first appear no answer is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you ask the Germ theorist to point out the relation between injecting germs into small animals and giving humans the same germs in food or drink, they have to admit that these arc two distinct procedures with practically no relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you ask why thousands of men carry germs without injury to themselves the replies vary, but all are unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you examine the standard works on bacteriology yon find no positive proofs given, that germs, if taken in food or drink, are harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you point out the cruelties inflicted upon dumb animals during their experiments the reply is that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the end justifies the means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The assumptions that because germs are found with disease they are the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cause</span><span class="font5"> of it, and that if injected germs will cause disease, inhaled or ingested germs will do the same, is surely a “foundation of sand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first point for the Biochcmic theorists to decide was whether the germs appeared before or after the onset of the disease. This was a rather difficult task, as our professional bacteriologists arc not called until after the 26 attending physician sees the ease, and the latter is not called until after the disease shows itself, when it is usually too late to make a fair test: but a long, careful study of early cases, especially in pneumonia, typhoid, and diphtheria, where the appearance of the germs is often delayed, showed that the germ followed the onset of disease, and consequently could not be the cause of it. My own observations covered a period of over three years. Many other careful observers have investigated this point, and today there is a mass of evidence that cannot be broken down that the germs are the product and not the cause of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Germ theorists strongly opposed this pivotal point—claiming that the germs were present but undiscovered—their argument was met by destroying all uncertainty and dealing with solid facts they could not deny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bearing in mind that germs arc the products of disease, and thus harmless, the Bio-chemic theorists carried out the following experiments :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Typhoid Germs. In testing typhoid germs, forty-five experiments were made in which water, milk, bread, cheese, meat, fish, potatoes, headcheese, butter, porridge, etc., were infected with millions of fresh, vigorous typhoid germs; this food containing the germs was used in the ordinary way; and, as the Biochcmics expected, there was not a single instance of any sign of typhoid. Here we have forty-five facts— not assumptions—to build on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pneumonia Germs. In this series of nineteen experiments, milk, water and food were infected with millions of pneumonia germs, and although no precautions were taken to prevent the disease, no sign of the disease developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Diphtheria Germs. A total of forty experiments were made with germs of diphtheria, in which not only were they taken in water, milk, bread, porridge, potatoes, cheese, butter, etc., but other millions of germs were swabbed in the nose and throat, and every facility given them to develop, but in spite of all efforts they refused to develop, although they would grow rapidly on nutrient agar. These tests were made scientifically, and part of the germs were grown from stock tubes furnished by one of the best known laboratories in North America. These are facts, not opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tuberculosis Germs. In this series of tests nineteen experiments were made; special at* tention was paid to thoroughly infecting milk, water, bread, meat, potatoes, etc., with millions of germs, fresh and vigorous, but in spite of every effort to get them to develop they were positively inert. The germs used were human (not bovine) tubercle bacilli germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meningitis Germs. As these are the dreaded germs supposed by some to cause infantile paralysis, and believed to germinate in the nasal mucous membrane, special pains were taken to infect the nostrils and throat with fresh colonies of germs; they were swept over the turbinated bones, pushed into sinuses, swabbed over the (loor of the nostrils, rubbed on the tonsils, placed beneath the tongue, taken in milk, water or food; but in spile of coaxing, coddling and urging, they'refused to produce a solitary sign of meningitis in the eleven tests made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ten experiments were made with mixed germs, viz., typhoid and pneumonia, typhoid and tuberculosis, diphtheria and meningitis, typhoid and meningitis, diphtheria and pneumonia, etc., but, all failed to produce anj effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chemical Causes of Disease</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experience of ages has shown that many diseases have a chemical (not bacterial) origin; as example, tainted fish, meat or oysters contain a chemical poison that will cause typhoid; the inhalation of chlorine or bromine gas will cause bronchitis and pneumonia—the latter may also be caused by the chemical effect of exposure to cold; sunstroke, by the chemical effect of heat; lead poisoning, by working in lead; stone-cutters or miners phthisis, by’ the inhalation of coal or mineral particles; Rhus poisoning, by coming in contact with poison ivy ; cirrhosis of the liver, through abuse of alcoholic liquors; colic, from eating green apples or unsuitable food: in fact, it is the violation of chemical laws that causes most of our intestinal diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Summary of Facts</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. That germs follow the onset of disease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. That many diseases have a chemical origin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. That germs may be inhaled or ingested without harm.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Truly a rock foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Germ theorist viewpoint it is permissible to dump barrels of an irritant poison </span><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(bleaching powder) into drinking water; from the Biochemic theorist viewpoint that act is maniacal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Germ theorist viewpoint it is reasonable to forbid milkmen to sell or deliver natural milk; from the Biochemic theorist viewpoint that act is criminal. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Germ theorist viewpoint it is advisable to quarantine citizens if found carrying certain germs; from the Biochemic theorist viewpoint it is an unwarranted robbery of our citizens’ liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many believe that chlorination protects from typhoid; but the facts that Toronto, with chlorinated water, has ai. average death rate from typhoid twice that of London, England, with natural water, and that- in 1916 we had three times as many deaths from typhoid as in 1915, show their mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, while chlorination does not save us from typhoid, being an irritant to the mucous membrane, it favors nephritis and Bright’s disease. Toronto’s record is suggestive: In 1912 Toronto lost 164 citizens from nephritis (inflammation of kidneys) and Bright’s disease; during 1913-1914 the deaths increased, and in 1915 Toronto lost 218 persons from these diseases — an increase of over thirty percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many citizens believe that half-cooked, pasteurized milk is safe, hut the facts that Toronto’s infan 1 iIe death rate is twen ty-ni no percent higher than in London, England, and twice as great as in rural Ontario (both of the latter using natural milk); that the death rate in Toronto Sick Children’s Hospital, in the Infant’s Home on St. Mary street, and in the H. C. Infant’s Home on Power street, increased when they stopped using natural milk, all show clearly that the insane desire to tamper with normal milk has cost Toronto many infantile lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, when citizens of whatever country realize that they may be quarantined simply because they unknowingly carry some harmless germs, and thousands do so, it is time for them to organize and fight for their personal rights. It is a battle between principles; a fight between later scientific facts and past theories; a question that must he fought out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Biochemic theory appeals to humane persons; for, where thousands of small animals have suffered death through Germ theorists' experiments, the experiments here mentioned cost neither life nor health to man or animal. . . . —eJohn B. Fraser, M.D., C.M.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>Political Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• How soon a “depression” will come, with the consequent storms, no one knows. Probably the Rome talks between the British premier and II Duce have started something. Mr. Chamberlain is acting the part of a democratic dictator, so much as his position in the government allows him to do. At present there is nothing in sight to threaten his leadership, and as he undoubtedly believes he has a mission to save the peace he is likely to take a place as a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many in the Conservative party, to which the premier owes allegiance, who have a leaning towards the Fascist form of dictatorship: they believe that this promises them a safeguard against the encroachments of the working classes, as they choose to call the manual workers. Liberalism as a political force is almost nonexistent, and the Labor party is not sufficiently numerous at the polls nor sufficiently united in itself to dislodge the present government, nor to take control even if it won a general election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That there is in the country a majority of those who are of the Left in politics is fairly certain, and if united they could turn out the present national government, but which is, in practice, controlled by the Conservative party; but the variety of opinions and the many interests whieh are to be served would prevent them from forming a government satisfactory to the people. In the present unrest there is little doubt, were an election to come, that the present form of government would be retained, chiefly because of the necessity of keeping up with the threatening totalitarian powers in Europe. There are many who believe that Chamberlain is no match for the astute and purposeful dictators, and who fear that his policy of appeasement will bring disaster to Britain and the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All these things are watched by Jehovah’s witnesses with the interest of those who know that in them all the purposes of Jehovah are being brought to a conclusion, to the honor and vindication of His great and holy name. These are giving the witness of His Word, instructed thereby, to the fact that His day is come and that He has set His King upon His hill of Zion. The failure of religionists to declare the things of the Scriptures which God caused to be recorded for this very time, and their openly declared rejection of those prophecies as the Word of God, has brought their rejection by Him. Like the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day they have had the key of knowledge, but have both refused to enter in and kept out those who sought to enter. (See Matthew 23:13; Luke 11: 52.) Jehovah’s witnesses know that in this daj<sup>T</sup> of judgment all the forces of evil are to be destroyed whether they be religious, financial or political, and that with the destruction of these evils there is also that of the invisible forces which under the leadership of the Devil have deceived mankind in all things concerning God and Uis holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Employment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• “It is an ill wind that blow<sup>r</sup>s no one any good,” says the proverb. A special correspondent of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> who has made a tour of the shipyards and the near-by cities and towns makes the remark that but for Hitler and Mussolini the workers in the shipyards would be in a sorry state. No doubt his remark is true to fact; for there is no increase in genera) trade, and already ships have difficulty in getting paying cargoes. The rearmament plans, which are costing the country more than one million pounds sterling a day, are keeping the shipyards busy, and that means work is spread through the country in the various forges and industries whose work must go to the building of the war ships. In the meantime the communities connected with the shipbuilding industry are fairly prosperous: there is money to spend, and the shops are busy. Construction of vessels for the carrying-trade services and for transport is poor, as arc also the prospects. Some ships for British owners are, in fact, being built in Continental shipyards, partly because of lower costs, but also, it is said, because this is a way of getting interest on foreign loans which might otherwise not be got. The exporting of coals from Newcastle is proverbial knowledge: coal is never taken to Newcastle; but the quantity of its export tonnage is much less than in pre-war days. In the year 1913 the tonnage of coal from the Tyne was over 21,000,000 tons, whereas in 1937 the amount was only a little over 11,000,000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By some Parliament is considered to be very lax and slow in action in its attempts to relieve districts where unemployment, both of skilled and of unskilled, is prevalent. There are many obstructive interests in the way; but the rearmament schemes and works are perforce doing something which brings relief, a costly method and necessarily temporary in character. Social services have to be curtailed, and schemes for genera) improvement shelved, while this special work is on. The big landowners, and big business, lack either inclination or time to give attention to the general welfare of the country’ and its people. There would be a great outcry if a strong government in peacetime should set about great works of permanent benefit to the country, such as making arterial roads for the great increase of road traffic, improving the present roads, making new docks, settling waste lands, afforestation; but now they must spend the money for guns and ammunition, for aeroplanes, and an increased army and navy, and for hosts of officials. The income tax report at the end of the year 1938 showed that £242,000,000 had to be collected during the following three months if a deficit in the year’s balance sheet is not to be shown.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Adoration of the Crib</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">® Guided by the Scriptures through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses have for some years past refused to take any part in the religious practices of “Christmas”, whether those of organized religion or of the old pagan practices. Everyone knows that the Roman Catholic worship of the “crib” and the high mass on the eve of “Christmas” are the high spot of that church’s year. The Roman Catholic must attend mass three times a year, on Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, if he would retain the benefits of his church. The so-called “Protestant” sects content themselves with making the day like a Sunday; but this past Christmas the Church of England, seeing the pulling power of the ‘adoration of the crib’, thought to try to help their call to religion by it. The archbishop of Canterbury had one fixed in his cathedral. This, to the Kensititcs [followers of John Kensit], stalwarts against the practices of Rome in the Church of England, was as a red rag to a bull. They sent a man down to shout out an objcc-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MARCH 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">tion as the archbishop began the “worship”. He called out his piece, and was hustled out of the church. These Kensititcs, with their Wycliffe preachers, know the false claims of the Papacy and the danger there is to the liberties of the people, but beyond publishing books and pamphlets against Roman claims and efforts to keep the English church free from its practices they do not go, and they have the usual antipathy of all other religionists to the witness of the Truth. Despite the activities of all the religionists, there is no question that Britain is becoming pagan: it is said that in England not more than 20 percent of the population pay even lip service to organized religion.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>“Folden Together as Thorns”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• The clergy and the preachers have to get themselves into the news. They have tried to make the people believe they hold a commission to establish the kingdom of heaven in the earth; and though they have accomplished so little, they must show they arc thinking about the terrible condition into which the world is falling. So whenever a chance comes they hold a conference and get the newspapers to publish a statement. The bitter treatment of the Jews in Europe gave them such a chance, and the Church of England, Nonconformists and Roman Catholics joined in telling how united they are. Then the archbishop of Canterbury called a conference of Protestant parsons, and these unitedly tell all who will listen how shocked they are at the conduct of some (unnamed) harsh rulers. Probably these men were stimulated to this meeting and pronouncement by the pope’s many recent broadcasts. Ignoring the Scriptures and the great prophecies these men reveal that they still cling to their hope in a League of Nations. They say they are greatly concerned about the growing paganism of Germany, and because of the open declaration that God must be worshiped through Nazi acknowledgment. They decry the action of any state which sets itself up as God’s representative. These clergy know very well that the Roman church is a political organization, and that its pope is the head of a state; but they are no longer protestants, and are well pleased to hide the truth from themselves as well as try to keep it from the people. Tn his speeches and writings Judge Rutherford has made all this clearly to be seen that the people may know the truth, and thousands are learning</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">29 </span><span class="font5">that religion and all its professions are deceptions which must be shunned if light and understanding of the purpose of God is to be gained, and if one would be saved from destruction in the trouble only a little way ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost up to the year of the Great War the Church of England rested itself in providing opportunities for its worship; it built a church in each parish and found a parson. The Nonconformists were more aggressive, but they had dropped into comparative ease. The social evils, mainly the result of a hard industrial system, and the agitation of the leaders of Labor got some of the parsons on the move. But the Great War had an eruptive effect on organized religion, and since then they have found that their professions count for little and their creeds and dogmas for less. If they are not to go out of sight altogether they must show they are alive to world conditions and are not merely local units trying to keep alive a dying cause. While the so-called “Protestants” hold conferences the Roman Catholics have got Catholic Action into activity, and the other religionists have to admit that the Roman Church is the most alive of any. It appears that the Hierarchy in Rome is keeping off the League of Nations idea: the League of Nations Union in Britain is almost wholly Protestant or non-Roman Catholic, and that does not suit Rome, playing its game to be on the top when the crisis in religion shows up.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>A Witnessing Incident</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• One of Jehovah’s witnesses tells of his attempts at conversation with some of his fellow train travelers. Opposite to him in a compartment was a dean or bishop of the Church of England, designated as such by his hat strings and gaiters. To get a chance of a witness he quite innocently asked the “reverend” why there should be 200 varied religions in this country, and how they all stand in relation to God—were all acceptable to Him. “Well,” said the gentleman, “except for the church of Rome, which stands apart, there is great tolerance”; and, “Really, does it matter very much what one believes, what dogmas he accepts or refuses, if he is a member of a church ?” “But,” said the friend, “if God has given the Scriptures for the instruction of those who are acceptable to Him, such differences prove there is something seriously wrong.” Taking a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font5"> booklet from his pocket he asked the parson to read it. The parson looked at it and in it, and handed it back; then he reached for his small luggage and got out of the compartment, seeking an easier place. In the compartment were two Salvation Army officers. The friend asked them if they were still preaching the old “hellfire” gospel. “Oh,” said they, “we dropped that twenty years ago.” Then, in response, “I suppose you are now telling the people you made a mistake and are doing something to try to correct what you wrongly taught, and do not now believe—or you do not dare to preach it.” No, they were not. He added, “But what of the blasphemy on the name of God? How do you stand before Him, if you have preached so terrible a thing in His name, and know it is not true? Ought you not for His name’s sake tell the people where you stand in this?” These also found the compartment uncomfortable, and left it to find a cooler place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They Think Their Houses Shall Endure </span><span class="font5">• So said the psalmist long ago when speaking of those who are wise according to the wisdom of men, and of fools and brutish persons. Of them he said, “Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwell in gplaces to all generations; thev call their lands after their own names.” —Psalm 49:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitler says he has settled Germany for a thousand years. He got very angry when the British premier said of the recent happenings in Europe that they brought forth governments which had their day and passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Church of England cathedral which is being erected in Liverpool is having a peal of bells cast which are to ring for 500 years —so its principal men say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholics in Liverpool go one better: their book of remembrance in which the names of donors of £1 are entered is to be in the cathedral for all time. The cathedrals will go into disuse ere long; but the bad records of some men will be remembered in the judgment a thousand years hence.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>For Better or Worse</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Queen Elizabeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Queen Elizabeth, building at Clydebank, Scotland, is the largest commercial ship in the world. It is 1,030 feet in length, 118 feet beam, and measures 120 feet in depth from the lounge structure to the keel. The tonnage, 85.000, is about 1.500 over that of the Normandie. Experience has shown that these very large and very fast ships arc the most economical for their owners. Two ships like the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth, each crossing the ocean in four days, and between them providing a service each way every week, are less expensive to operate than smaller and slower boats, which would require three vessels to do the work of these two mistresses of the deep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ A New York judge is trying to decide what to do with a 13-ycar-old boy who has been a stowaway on four ocean trips aggregating 20,000 miles of travel. Memory goes back to Frank McNair, a fine, intelligent boy, of good parentage, who made it his business to ride the railways free into every state and city of the United States, and finally disappeared, in 1890, probably killed in a wreck. The best thing to do with the Brooklyn boy was done; i. e., get him a good job on an ocean liner and let him stay there. It was his wish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&lt;&gt; Oeean liners are silent when passing Pcrc6, near the tip of Gaspe peninsula, Quclxjc. The reason is that this has Iwcomc a bird sanctuary and if the ocean liners blow their whistles the birds on the top of Perce Rock become frightened and, in their haste to seek safety, upset hundreds of their eggs or young into the sea. It is rather a nice thing to know that men are heeding the needs of these little feathered folks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">YoU can get this G4-page booklet, written by Judge Rutherford, one month before the world-wide distribution begins. Its front cover, illustrated here, shows at a glance the issue that confronts the people of all nations. Totalitarianism, which places the state as supreme and denies all rights of the individual, is rapidly sweeping the earth. Soon you may have to answer for yourself the question: Shall I yield and become a prisoner to that monstrosity, or will I resist it and serve Jehovah God, trusting in His power to protect and deliver me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Read the facts presented in FASCISM OR FREEDOM. You can have it now on a 5c contribution, which will enable us to make a wider distribution later on.</span></p>

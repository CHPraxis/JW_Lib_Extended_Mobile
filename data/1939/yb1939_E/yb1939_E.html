<p><span class="font8">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S KINGDOM is marching majestically onward, and the day of complete triumph to his glory is near at hand. The year last past has seen a marked increased activity of Jehovah’s faithful people and much opposition to the work and divers and numerous blessings upon his witnesses, all of which have been attended with joy. Never before have those faithful men and women so fully realized that “the joy of the Lord is [our] strength”. Armed in the holy cause of righteousness, and working under the command and leadership of Christ Jesus the King, Jehovah’s witnesses have experienced and appreciated that the bitter opposition toward the witness work manifested by the enemy, instead of dismaying God’s faithful people, has sharpened their wits, increased their zeal for the Kingdom, and widened their vision of glories that soon shall be made manifest to all who desire life. During the year the opponents to the kingdom of God have shown their malicious wickedness in a more emphasized degree than was ever before made manifest. God’s people expected this because the Lord so instructed them. Being forewarned that the opposition would increase, the faithful followers of Christ Jesus have met that opposition courageously and continue to battle against the same in the strength of the Lord. At the close of the fiscal year it can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and is truthfully stated that Jehovah’s witnesses are in a more joyful and prosperous condition than ever before. They visualize the Kingdom more fully than in times past and have a keener appreciation of God’s favors manifested toward them.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THE CONTROVERSY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Compared with the population of the nations, Jehovah’s witnesses are extremely few in number. In themselves they have no strength. Their strength comes from the Lord, and they delight to do his will. They have no political ambitions and no desire for commercial gain. They require the necessities of this life, but their deep concern is for God’s kingdom. But they always heed the words and admonition of Jesus, to wit: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (Matt. 6: 33) They know that their daily bread is sure, and after they have made provision for such they joyfully contribute their material substance to further the Kingdom interests. They have in mind the precious words recorded by Jehovah God’s prophet, to wit: “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” (Ps. 37:25) Knowing that they are held in the hollow of Jehovah’s hand, they faithfully push on with the battle. They do not seek or even desire anything that others have. They are not in competition with any class of people under the sun. They pursue the even tenor of their way determined to do what God has commanded them to do, always rendering themselves in obedience to his will. Associated with the anointed are the “other sheep” of the Lord, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” and which will ultimately compose the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9-17) Against Jehovah's witnesses and their companions, the “other sheep” of the Lord, are pitted the combined forces of all religious organizations on the earth, and such religious organizations are supported by many professional politicians and commercial giants or traffickers, all of whom desire to rid the earth of this little company of faithful Christians. To many persons this may seem incredible; but if one can calmly and without passion or prejudice give consideration to the facts herein set forth, he will see the reason for the controversy existing and why Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to serve God regardless of all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Jehovah’s witnesses” is a name taken from God’s Word, the Bible, and which name the Almighty God gives to those persons who have devoted themselves wholly and unreservedly to his cause and service. Jehovah’s witnesses do not constitute a sect, as many attempt to make it appear. A “sect”, as defined by lexicographers, consists of “those following a particular leader, or attached to a certain opinion; those who propagate their opinion or belief”. Jehovah’s witnesses do not follow any earthly leader. They follow Christ Jesus. They are not attached to any certain opinion, but they are entirely devoted to God and his Word as set forth in the Bible. They are Christians, which name means that they insist that it is their duty and obligation to obey the law of God even as Christ Jesus is always obedient to the law of Jehovah God. They carefully study and consider the Word of God that they may ascertain his will and, doing his will, may have God’s approval, and they are not at all ashamed of the work in which they are privileged to engage. (2 Tim. 2:15) They do not seek the approval of men. They diligently endeavor always to please the Almighty God. Those who go to make up the witnesses of Jehovah and their companions may at some time in the past have been associated with either the Jews or Catholics or other religious organization. They have no political ambition or aspirations, and hence do not support any worldly organization, but, following the admonition of the Scripture, keep themselves “unspotted from the world”. Why, then, are Jehovah’s witnesses so vigorously opposed by others ? The Scriptures give the complete answer, to which reference is made.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THE MONSTROSITY VS. THE KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Those who believe and study the Bible clearly discern that Satan the Devil attempts to mimic Jehovah God and to produce various counterfeits of God’s creation. This Satan the wicked one does to mock God, to reproach his name and to turn the people away from God and bring about their destruction which he long ago threatened to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A monstrosity is that which is monstrous, strange, ugly, vicious, extremely wicked, hateful, horrible and dreadful. Only Satan the Devil could produce such a thing; God could not produce such a thing; and this we know because it is authoritatively written concerning Jehovah God that all of “his work is perfect”. (Deut. 32:4) A monstrosity is against God, and hence is unrighteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The last days,” as used in the Scriptures, refers to the closing days of Satan’s operations on the earth, and which time is called a “perilous” time. God, foreknowing the end from the beginning, caused to be recorded in his prophetic Word that a monstrosity would arise in these last days that would mentally blind the people and bring great woe upon the earth. We are now in “the last days”, and the monstrosity is to be expected to appear and has appeared. God pictured that monstrosity by an unusual creature called Goliath the giant. Satan, the enemy of God, is also called “that old Serpent”, and the name “old Serpent” means “arch deceiver”. He is also called by the name “Dragon”, meaning “destroyer”. That which Satan produces is hateful and horrible. Satan has produced and brought forth in these days a great monstrosity which is a means of great deception to the people and leads multitudes into destruction. It is written of Satan that he fliath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious good news of Christ Jesus, who is the image of God, should shine unto the people’. (2 Cor. 4:4) The monstrosity that has appeared in these last days produces blindness, that is to say, a lack of understanding by those who do not believe God and Christ Jesus. Jehovah described that monstrosity that has appeared in the earth and deceived the people as “the abomination that maketh desolate”. (Dan. 11: 31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.;</span><span class="font5"> Dan. 12:11) That name means that the monstrosity is a horrible and wicked thing and that its determination is to make desolate everything that is for the good of mankind. Jesus Christ further emphasizes the wickedness of that monstrosity and sounds the warning against it by using these words: <sup>&lt;c</sup>But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaa flee to the mountains.” (Mark 13:14) Those words of the Lord Jesus, as shown by the context, apply specifically to the present time, that is to say, particularly from the year 1918 onward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That which is of greatest importance to humankind, and which will work to the greatest good to and blessing of man, is the kingdom of God, under the immediate rule of Christ Jesus the King. Its importance is further emphasized in this, that the Kingdom will be a complete vindication of Jehovah’s name and prove to all creation that Jehovah is supreme, the source of life and the giver of every good and perfect gift. The monstrosity mentioned is the worst foe of God, is against his kingdom, and is man’s greatest enemy. In order that we may understand and appreciate the many perils that now are upon the world, it is necessary to know why Jehovah God promised the Kingdom, why he sets up the Kingdom under Christ, and also to know why that monstrosity has appeared at the present time in bitter opposition to the Kingdom. This information will clearly disclose the purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses and the work in which they are now engaged, and will make clear why Jehovah’s witnesses are so bitterly opposed and persecuted by certain organizations in the earth. Such information at this time is vitally necessary for all persons who desire life, peace and prosperity. A brief statement of facts explaining the matter is now here made in order that the reader of this report may more keenly appreciate the work accomplished in the year just past that has been done by those who love God and his King, and the bitter persecution of those who have done that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God in the beginning made his creature Lucifer the overlord of the earth, including perfect man. Lucifer rebelled against God, and in that rebellion he was joined by a host of angelic creatures and also the perfect man Adam. God then gave Lucifer four names which names indicate the kind of creature he is. That rebel has since been known as Dragon, that old Serpent, the Devil and Satan. (Rev. 20: 2) The rebellion of the Devil resulted in the death of Adam, the perfect man; hence Satan is called “a murderer from the beginning”. (John 8:44) The sin committed by the perfect man Adam not only led to his death but has resulted in bringing suffering and death upon all mankind. The greatest of all crimes committed by the Devil was and is this, to wit: He challenged God to put on the earth men that would remain true and faithful to 'God when put to the test, the Devil claiming that he could cause all men to curse Jehovah God to his face and bring about their destruction. (Job 1:11; 2:5) That challenge raised the question of Jehovah’s supremacy. For that great crime committed by Satan God sentenced him to destruction, but God deferred the execution of that sentence until a later time in order to give Satan full opportunity to prove his wicked challenge, and when Satan’s failure is clearly shown God carries out the execution of that wicked one by exercising His supreme power against </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">. Therefore Jehovah said to the Devil: “For this cause have I [permitted] thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser) </span><span class="font5">For centuries the Devil has attempted to make good his challenge. He has failed, and now his destruction draws near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately following the wicked rebellion God gave his unchangeable word of promise that he would in his own due time raise up a “Seed”, by and through which the obedient ones of the human race should receive the blessings of life. That promised seed is Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of the human race. (Gal. 3:16) God also promised that he would cause a righteous government to be set up and that such government or kingdom of God is to be ruled over by Christ Jesus and that the peace and prosperity and joy and blessings of that government shall never end. (Isa. 9:6, 7) God also gave his word that his kingdom under Christ would bring about the complete destruction of Satan and all of his supporters. (Ezek. 28:14-19; Isa. 14:12-15) The challenge of the Devil and God’s emphatic declaration to set up a righteous government draw the issue sharply. Knowing this fact the Devil has used all the power at his command to reproach the name of the Almighty God. That great monstrosity, described in the Scriptures as “the abomination of desolation”, is the final effort of Satan to accomplish his wicked purpose, which is to reproach Jehovah’s name, deceive the people and bring about their destruction. These times of peril therefore make two companies into which the people of the earth are formed: one, in the organization ruled by Satan; the other, in the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus. Satan’s crowd and followers are headed to complete destruction. Those who take refuge in God’s kingdom have the promise of life everlasting in endless joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>THE THEOCRACY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A pure theocracy must and shall rule the world. The supreme Ruler is Jehovah God, the great Theo-crat. His government under Christ Jesus the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font5">, therefore, is a theocracy. Such government must be conducted exactly in harmony with the law of Jehovah God. His will must be done at all times. That government must be wholly righteous, and in it there shall be nothing unrighteous permitted to exist. It is written that all the laws of God are right. (Ps. 19: 7-9) “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” (Ps. 119:142) Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, always strictly obeys the law of Jehovah the Almighty, and Christ Jesus always proclaims the truth. He is the first Christian, his name “Christ” meaning the “Anointed One” of Jehovah, clothed with authority to act for Jehovah. All Christians, therefore, must likewise obey the law of God and always tell and proclaim the truth.—John 5:30-36; 18:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The theocratic government of righteousness shall be upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus because God has appointed him to that high position. (Isa. 9: 6,7) That government shall be forever a righteous government. (Isa. 32:1) Such theocratic government is the means by which blessings are extended to all creatures obedient thereto, and, above all, it will completely vindicate the name of Jehovah as the only true and almighty God and prove to all creation that he is the supreme One, entitled to all praise and joyful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has never been disturbed by the rebellion of Satan or the wickedness of men, because he well knew from the beginning that in his own due time he would convince all who love that which is right that he, Jehovah, is the right and righteous One. Over a period of many centuries God caused to be made many prophetic pictures, and these were recorded in his Word, and they foretell the development of the theocracy and what it will accomplish. All of those prophetic pictures were made for the instruction, aid and encouragement, comfort and hope of those people on the earth in these last days who love God and serve him and who follow in the footsteps of Jesus in obeying God’s law. Because of the great wickedness now in the earth the lovers of righteousness need such encouragement, and God provides that very thing for them. A few centuries after the rebellion, and when many human creatures had been bom, almost all of them became desperately wicked, and the only exception was Noah, and his immediate family. Noah and his sons believed and loved God. God provided for their protection and then brought a great deluge upon the earth, which destroyed all flesh except Noah and his family. That great deluge or flood was a prophetic picture of the final destruction that shall come upon the world, including all nations, and which takes place at the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which is called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font5"> and which battle is now near at hand, and concerning which a warning must be given to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within a few years after the flood there was a man on the earth whose name was Nimrod and who because of his extreme wickedness was made the chief earthly representative of the Devil. With Nimrod the Devil organized religion, by which means he caused the people to worship creatures instead of the Creator. Thereafter all the nations of the earth adopted and practiced some kind of religion, and the invisible object of their worship was the Devil and his wicked angels, which by the Scriptures are described as “other gods”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham’s descendant Jacob, who was also called Israel, God chose for his specific service, and his descendants are called Israelites. Thereafter Jehovah God used the Israelites and those associated with them to make prophetic pictures foretelling what should come to pass in the future, and particularly in these last days where we now are. That at least some of those Israelites might be uneontaminated by the Devil religion and might be found true to Almighty God when he should send his beloved Son Jesus to earth, God gave to the Israelites his law. (Gal. 3:16-24) Moses was a faithful servant of Jehovah God, and Jehovah chose Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, where they were domiciled, and later, when that people were assembled together to receive instructions from God through Moses, the admonition was given to them concerning religion in these words, to wit: “And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.”—Ex. 20:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, God specifically instructed his people that religion constitutes a snare into which the Devil leads them, to turn them away from Jehovah. “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.” “The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.” (Deut. 7:16, 25) Thus Jehovah shows to his people that the practice of religion ensnares them, because religion is the invention of the Devil employed to mock and reproach God and to entrap the people and lead them to destruction. By prophetic pictures and express declarations God foretold that &quot;Christendom” would become extremely religious and would fall into the Devil’s snare. By “Christendom” is meant those nations of the earth which claim to be Christian nations, but which nations are devoted to selfishness. The Israelites were ensnared by the Devil religion and suffered the consequences. (Judg. 2:1-3) Religion brought about the downfall of the nation of Israel. Within a short time it will cause the complete downfall and destruction of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his due time Jehovah God sent his beloved Son Jesus to the earth to proclaim the truth and to instruct the Jews, or Israelites, in the right way, and that Jesus might gather unto himself those Jews, or Israelites, who continued to be faithful to the Almighty God. The Devil had been busily at work amongst the Jews, and their leaders constituted the clergymen, which men had adopted religion based upon the traditions of men brought into operation by the Devil, and by which the Word of God is made of no value. Jesus severely denounced those religious leaders and their religion and told them that they had become the children of the Devil because they had turned away from God’s law and adopted and practiced religion. (Matt. 15:1-9; 23:13-34; John 8:42-44) By obeying the law that God had given to Israel a few of the Israelites remained true and faithful to the Almighty. It is such faithful ones that Jesus gathered unto himself, and they were made witnesses for Jehovah, and at the Lord’s command they went about bearing testimony to the name and kingdom of Almighty God. Jesus and all his faithful disciples were bitterly persecuted by the religionists of that day. Why such persecution? Because Jesus and his disciples were telling the people about God’s kingdom, the great theocratic government, and the blessings it would bring to the people. The religionists viciously persecuted Jesus and caused him to be put to a violent death. After the resurrection of Jesus from the dead his faithful disciples were informed that the purpose of Jehovah was to “take out ... a people for his name” from amongst the nations of the earth and to use those people to bear witness to the name of Jehovah God, and hence such must become Jehovah’s witnesses. It is the obligation laid upon all such witnesses to make known the name of Jehovah God, his supremacy, his kingdom, and to declare to the people God’s purpose and to give them warning of the impending destruction of all who are in opposition to the great theocratic government.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>THE KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When on the earth that which Jesus emphasized at all times was the kingdom of God. Jehovah God had anointed Jesus to be the head of the Kingdom, that is, the King of the theocratic government. Continuing to stress the great importance of the Kingdom, Jesus taught his disciples to always pray to Jehovah God: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as in heaven.’ Ever since that time Christians have continued to utter that prayer. It is the government of Jehovah they desire, knowing that his will shall be done therein on earth as in heaven. Jesus, when on the earth as a man, specifically instructed his followers that he must go away and receive the kingdom authority and that he would come again and set up that kingdom in Jehovah’s name. In harmony therewith the apostle Peter, standing among the Israelites who had brought about the death of Jesus, declared these words: “This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. . . . Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.’&quot;’ —Acts 2: 32, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a period of 1800 years and more after Pentecost the faithful Christians in the earth have preached Christ Jesus, “and him crucified,” the Redeemer and Savior and King of the world, and at all times have called attention to the promise that Christ Jesus would come again and gather unto himself his faithful followers and set up the theocratic government. In 1914 the time limit set by Jehovah God in which the Devil should operate without hindrance came to an end. God then sent forth Christ. Jesus the King, enthroned him and directed him to begin his rule while Satan and his organization are still in the earth. (Ps. 110:1, 2; Rev. 11:17,18) Immediately there followed a war in heaven in which Jesus Christ and his angels fought against the Devil and his angels, and the Devil and his angels were cast out of heaven and down to the earth. (Rev. 12: 7-9) The King, Christ Jesus, had begun his reign, the first part of which was to oust the Devil from heaven and confine him and his operations to the earth until the battle of the great day of God Almighty. That battle in heaven brought to the mind of the Devil that his time is now short and that the final showdown is near at hand, and for this reason it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War, in which the nations of earth, particularly “Christendom”, engaged from 1914 to 1918, was further evidence, according to prophecy, that the reign of Christ Jesus the King had begun and that Satan’s world had come to an end. (Matt. 24:3-13) At that time religion, improperly bearing the name “Christian religion”, had almost entirely superseded true worship of Almighty God and the leading nations had become known as “Christendom”, and which religious organization deceived millions of people, causing them to believe that “Christendom” supports the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ. The time of great crisis had arrived. What, then, must be done by the true followers of Christ Jesus? The answer is found in the command of Jesus given to his faithful followers, that they must go forth and bear testimony before the people, which testimony constitutes good news or “gospel”, that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and this must be done as a witness to the people that they may be warned of the impending disaster upon Satan and all worldly organizations. Jesus’ command to such is: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24:14,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the gospel continued, but was practically stopped during the World War from 1918 to 1919. At the end of that time there were a few Christians on the earth who, in obedience to the Lord’s command, were bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his theocratic government under Christ. Prior to that time they had been known as “Bible Students”, which they were, of course. Thereafter the Lord made it clearly to appear to them, by giving them an understanding of the Scriptures, that such faithful Christians constitute the people Taken out for his name’, and which people must be his witnesses in the earth to give testimony and warning to others. Then he made it clearly to appear from the Scriptures that they should no longer be called “Bible Students”, but that they should have “another name”. To such, as it is written, he says: “Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” (Isa. 62:2) That new name is “Jehovah’s witnesses”: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10-12) Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect organization amongst men, following an earthly leader and propagating an opinion, but they are the servants of Jehovah God acting under his command to be his witnesses, to declare his name throughout the earth immediately before the great battle of Armageddon takes place. Christ had come, and the time for the judgment of the nations of the earth had arrived. (Matt. 25:31-40) The true followers of Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has made his witnesses, must now declare to the people that Jehovah is God, that Christ is his anointed King, that the Kingdom is here, and that there is no place of safety save under the King, Christ Jesus. Therefore Jehovah says to such true servants of his: “Let all the nations, be gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who among them can declare this, and shew us former things ? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.” (Isa. 43:9) Thus it appears that Jehovah’s witnesses are true Christians, acting wholly in obedience to the command of the Almighty God. This they must do regardless of opposition that comes from any and all sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ Jesus, was, so are Jehovah’s witnesses, 'a voice in the wilderness crying out unto those who have an ear to hear.’ As Jeremiah the prophet of Jehovah was commanded to bear testimony and warning to Jerusalem, the type of “Christendom”, even so Jehovah’s witnesses are now commanded to bear testimony and warning to the antitype, that is to say, the peoples and nations that have adopted and follow religion and that constitute what is generally known as “Christendom”. As the Lord commanded Jeremiah, so he commands his true witnesses of the present day: 'Speak unto all the people all the words that I command thee to speak unto them, and diminish [omit] not a word; . . . And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, . . . then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’ (Jer. 26:1-6) “Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live; wherefore should this city be laid waste?”—Jer. 27:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even so now Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to warn the people of “Christendom” of the impending disaster of Armageddon and to tell them that their only means of safety is to escape from religious organizations and flee to God’s organization under Christ the King.—Ezek. 33: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In obedience to these commandments of the Lord the true Christians constituting Jehovah’s witnesses go forth and engage in the work of telling the truth concerning the theocratic government under Christ and of God’s purpose to destroy religious institutions and all of Satan’s organization, and this constitutes what the Scriptures designate as Jehovah’s “strange work”, which strange work he declares must be done immediately preceding his “strange act”, and which strange act is the great destruction that befalls the nations of the earth at the battle of Armageddon. (Isa. 28:21) During the fiscal year just past Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions have been diligent in going about the land proclaiming this message of warning and have thus engaged in the “strange work”. Religious leaders and their supporters look upon such work as very strange because it exposes religion to the view of the people. For a long time the people have been induced to believe that religion and Christianity are one and the same and that therefore anything said against religion is likewise said against Christianity; but such is entirely a wrong view. Religion has been and is the great snare of the enemy that has ensnared multitudes of people. The leaders have forgotten God, entirely substituted the precepts or teachings of men for God’s Word, followed tradition and not the Scriptures, and thus rendered the Scriptures of no effect, and consequently religion has become a snare and a racket. The leaders are greatly angered by hearing anything that exposes religion, and not only are they angry at the message, but they indulge in the cruel and wicked persecution of those men and women who bring these truths to the attention of the people, calling them to witness the fact that only God's kingdom under Christ can bring them salvation and everlasting blessings. Thus it is seen that Satan himself is the real one that causes the persecution to come upon Jehovah’s witnesses. And now in these final days he brings forth a great and hateful thing, excessively cruel and wicked, to oppose the theocratic government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MONSTROSITY</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5">That monstrosity now appears in the earth, claims the right to rule the world, and to regiment the people, and it is called the “Corporate State” or “totalitarian rule”. The ruling power is centered in a dictator, and all the people are commanded to be subject to that dictator. Such totalitarian rule is against God and against his kingdom and is brought forth as a counterfeit of Jehovah’s kingdom. It is the Devil’s attempt to mimic Jehovah’s government and to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name and to turn the people away from God and into destruction, in order that he, the Devil, may succeed in carrying out his original wicked challenge to the Almighty God. That monstrosity is made up of extremely selfish rulers, such as Fascists, Nazis, Communists and the leading religionists, of which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is chief. Note now the apparent similarity between the monstrosity and the kingdom of God, which the monstrosity attempts to counterfeit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the great Theocrat, in whom reside all power and authority. Christ Jesus the King is Jehovah’s officer, the administrator of his theocratic gov-eminent. On the earth the visible representatives of Christ Jesus during his reign following Armageddon will be the faithful men of old, such as Abel, Abraham, and others specifically named in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. To that theocratic government under Christ Jesus all the people must be fully obedient if they would live, and none will be permitted to live except those who do render themselves in obedience to that government. The theocratic government will be wholly and entirely righteous and will establish lasting peace, prosperity, joy and happiness and give life everlasting to all obedient ones on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The monstrosity, the counterfeit and product of the Devil, is, as viewed from the earth: Government or governments ruled by an arbitrary dictator to whom all the people are required to give allegiance and full obedience; all the people are regimented and directed as to what they may or may not do, and the dictator's word is law; the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the great religious institution of the earth, claims the right and authority to rule the earth as the vicegerent or representative of Christ, to occupy the place over the dictatorial government as a spiritual overlord; and back of all of this is the Devil himself, who claims to be equal to or superior to Jehovah God. The monstrosity is entirely unrighteous, extremely wicked, and brings upon the people strife, war, suffering and ultimately everlasting death. The monstrosity claims to have authority to bring about peace and prosperity and induces the people to believe that fact. Thus it is seen that the monstrosity, or mimic government, is this: The Devil assumes the place of Jehovah God; the Roman Catholic Hierarchy assumes the place of Christ Jesus the King, and the dictators of earth assume the place of the faithful men who shall be the princes in the earth. The monstrosity, therefore, is a counterfeit of God’s kingdom and a mockery of God and the means of working great deception upon the people. There is a deadly conflict, therefore, between the theocratic government of Jehovah under Christ and the monstrosity or dictatorial government brought forth by the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus foretold that the monstrosity would come forward and rear its hideous and abominable head at the time of the second coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom, and the indisputable facts show that exactly that thing has come to pass. It was in 1918 that Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah and gathered unto himself those men and women who at that time had proved faithful to God. It was about the same time that the League of Nations was formed, the announced purpose of which was to rule the world and establish lasting peace and prosperity, and which League of Nations the clergy of the earth declared must rule as the representative of Christ. The League of Nations was in fact brought forth to blind the people and for a time was used by the Devil to pave the way for his dictatorial, totalitarian, monstrous rule. God had declared through his prophet that the League of Nations would be formed and would fail, and, of course, the Devil knew that fact. (Isa. 8: 9,10) The Devil then saw to it that the totalitarian monstrosity arose in Italy under the name of Fascism, and later in Germany under the name of Nazism; in Russia it appears under the name of Communism; and now it practically dominates Europe. The dictators perform the political duties, and in this they are supported by the traffickers, and the great religious institution, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, acts as a spiritual superpower or overlord; and thus Fascism, Nazism, Communism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, political and religious powers, operate together, and together constitute the great monstrosity, which is anti-God and anti-God’s kingdom under Christ. Thus it is seen that religion is the tie that binds together the political and other elements; and that religion, as well as his entire monstrosity, is the invention of the Devil is clearly proved by the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy leads in the religious organizations of the earth; and the other religious organizations, because of fear, succumb to the dictates of the Hierarchy. The political dictators, together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, claim the right to rule the world, and all are against God and against his kingdom under Christ. None of the religious institutions nor their allies advocate or support the kingdom of God under Christ, and therefore they are dead against it; as Jesus puts it: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.”—Matt. 12: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As further evidence that the afore-mentioned monstrosity is against God and Christ and his kingdom, the Hierarchy and their allies, the Fascists and Nazis, join together in a wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, because Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the truth of and concerning the great theocracy or government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus. The combination aforementioned forming the monstrosity exactly fits the description given to it by Jesus as “the abomination of desolation”, and which abomination was foretold by Daniel the prophet (11:31; 12:11). The kingdom of God under Christ is here, and that kingdom is the only rightful rule of the world, and anything that is against or in opposition to that theocratic government is an abomination in the sight of the Almighty God. The fact that the monstrosity claims the right to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ Jesus is conclusive proof that it ‘stands in the holy place, where it ought not to stand’, and where it has no right to stand. Therefore the present “perilous times” is the time when the people must be warned as the Lord Jesus Christ commands, and his warning is give in these words: “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judsea flee to the mountains; . . . For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.”—Mark 13:14,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This warning Jesus gives specifically that the people on earth who are of good will toward God and his kingdom of righteousness may have an opportunity to flee from the monstrosity afore-mentioned and find refuge and safety and complete protection under Christ Jesus the King. There are millions of people held in bondage to religious organizations, and because of fear planted in them by the religious leaders they know not what to do to find safety. To them the warning must be sounded, that they may flee from such organizations to the Lord’s kingdom. Also the warning must be sounded in the hearing of the religious leaders, that they may know that Jehovah is the only true God and that they may have no excuse whatsoever to oppose his kingdom, which is now here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every Christian wholly devoted to God and his kingdom must be a witness to Jehovah, using his every effort to inform the people of God’s commandments, and if he fails to give such warning he shall suffer destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are accused by the enemy of engaging in a campaign of hate; and that charge is entirely untrue. Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a campaign of hate, but in a campaign of making known to the people that the kingdom of heaven under Christ Jesus is at hand, which kingdom Jesus admonished the people to pray for; and this work they are doing in obedience to the commandment of the Lord. It is the time when the name of Jehovah shall be completely vindicated, and this witness concerning Jehovah’s name must be given before he exercises his power to destroy Satan and his organization. Jehovah’s witnesses do not hate any creatures, but, like the Lord Jesus, they hate wickedness and love righteousness. (Ps. 45:7) As Jesus always tells the truth, so true Christians must tell the truth. They cannot ask permission of worldly authority to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom, because the supreme power rests in Jehovah and he has commanded that they must proclaim this message, and no creature has any authority to grant a permit to do the work that God commands must be done. Jehovah’s witnesses know that they will suffer much opposition and persecution at the hands of religionists and others of the monstrosity because they tell the truth, but with full confidence and rejoicing they go on doing the work which the Lord has commanded them to do. This they do because they are commanded by the Lord to do the work, and through his Word they know exactly what will be the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions the Jona-dabs are few in number and with little or no strength in themselves, but behind them and backing them up is all the power in the universe. They are the servants of the Almighty God, doing his work as commanded, and their heart devotion is entirely to him and to his King. Therefore they see and fully appreciate the words of the Lord as written: “For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chron. 16: 9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions know that they must suffer for a time at the hands of their persecutors, and they also know that in due time the Lord will completely deliver them and shower upon them his everlasting blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the prophetic pictures made and recorded in the Bible is that of Goliath the giant and of the shepherd boy David and of the conflict between the two, and the result. Goliath bullied all the armies of Israel and boasted of what he would do. Young David appeared upon the scene and inquired, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” With his shepherd’s sling and a few small stones David went forth to the assault of the giant and slew him. In that picture David represented the Lord Jesus Christ, while the giant pictured the dictatorial rule or great monstrosity that now appears and opposes God and his kingdom. The picture discloses that the Lord Jesus will completely destroy the totalitarian, dictatorial-religious-political rule at the battle of Armageddon. (1 Sam. 17:23-40) This part of the prophetic picture relates to the beginning of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another apt prophetic picture recorded in the Scriptures shows the end of the totalitarian combine, and which is this, to wit: The armies of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seii, all of whom practiced the Devil religion, agreed and conspired together to destroy God’s covenant people at Jerusalem. Their combined forces marched against Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat was then king of Jerusalem, and God commanded him to lead the Israelites out and march to meet the approaching enemy, and as they went to meet the enemy they were not to indulge in fighting but to sing the praises of Jehovah God. The Israelites obeyed that command, and Jehovah so maneuvered the enemy that the Ammonites and Moabites, picturing the political and commercial element of the monstrosity, first slew the Mount Seir-ites, picturing particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy religious combine, and then the Ammonites and the Moabites fought each other and destroyed each other. There the Israelites under Jehoshaphat pictured the people of God now on the earth under the command of Christ Jesus. At the battle of Armageddon the Greater-than-Jehoshaphat, namely, Christ Jesus, will completely destroy first the religious element, and then their allies, including the enemy; and Satan will be compelled to view it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another prophetic picture of this monstrosity, the religious element, represented particularly in the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is pictured as riding on the back of the other elements of the totalitarian government, the Hierarchy acting as a super-overlord. Then the Lord’s prophecy shows that the political and commercial element will join in the destruction of the religious Hierarchy combine; and this picture exactly fits the one at Jerusalem above described, when Jehoshaphat was king.—Rev. 17:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The totalitarian combine, including the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have put fear into aU the people on earth except those who fully trust in the Lord. Those who trust in and love and serve Jehovah God and Christ his King do not fear the conspirators forming the monstrosity. It is written in the Scriptures: &quot;The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29:25) Thus Jehovah gives fuU assurance that the only ones who will find safety are those who have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no fear</span><span class="font5"> of the Devil’s crowd but who put their trust wholly in Jehovah and Christ his King. It is well known that the fear of the monstrosity, and particularly the religious element thereof, has induced men in all political offices of the earth to violate their oath to protect the people’s interest, and to act according to the dictates of the monstrosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing this great crisis, those who really love Jehovah God and serve him are eager to inform the people of the facts, to the end that all who have a desire for righteousness may escape from the domination of the monstrosity and flee to the kingdom of God under Christ and there find safety. God has commanded that aU such must gather themselves together and seek righteousness and meekness in order that they may be hid in the time of his wrath, and he has laid the obligation upon his witnesses to so inform the people. (Zeph. 2:1-3) By the grace of Jehovah his faithful servants engage in his witness work, prompted entirely by an unselfish desire to do good in obedience to God’s commandment. They do harm to no one, but they do good unto all as they have opportunity. As the people of good will toward God come to understand the truth, they welcome Jehovah’s witnesses and they praise the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">name of Jehovah God for sending such witnesses to them to inform them. It is only the monstrosity, made up of the elements that oppose God and his kingdom, that hate and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, and this they do because the kingdom of God is his instrument that will bring about the destruction of the monstrosity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious institutions try to increase their power and influence by drawing men into their organization, and this they do without regard to how wicked the men are that become members of their organization. Exactly contrary to that course, Jehovah’s witnesses are not trying to build up an organization in which to draw men. Their duty is to tell the people about Jehovah and his King and kingdom, that those who desire life may flee to the Lord and find refuge and safety. The religious organizations claim that they are “saving souls”; which claim is utterly false, because it is written, “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” (Ps. 3:8, A.R.V.) No religious institution can provide salvation for mankind, and the claim to that effect is a fraud and snare. The lifeblood of Christ Jesus poured out in death provides the price for the purchase of all who will believe on and serve the Lord, and such is the means that God has provided for their salvation, and there is no other way of salvation. (Acts 4:11,12) Now is the time when Jehovah God declares his purpose to destroy all opposition to his kingdom and sends forth his witnesses to inform the people of this fact and of his means of salvation before the destruction takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing, then, that the afore-mentioned monstrosity is the Devil’s creation, made up of political, commercial and religious elements, which are combined together in opposing Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ, we should expect that that monstrosity, and particularly the religious element thereof, would persecute Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs. Why should we expect this? Because Jesus specifically warned his followers against that very persecuting element, when he said: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This explains why the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in every part of the earth persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, and why their allies, the dictators and their officers under them, indulge in the arrest, imprisonment and other means of ill-treating Jehovah’s witnesses. It is well known that those who serve God and Christ his King and who desire his kingdom are hated of all nations that now rule; and this is exactly as Jesus foretold it would be: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24:9) Such is a brief description of the “perilous times” that are now here and of the reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses are hated and persecuted. When Armageddon is ended, the survivors will greatly rejoice that they have given their full and complete allegiance to Jehovah God and his kingdom. The enemy will then be completely gone, and the Jonadabs, forming the “great multitude”, will then busy themselves in carrying out Jehovah’s mandate to multiply and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">replenish the earth with righteous creatures. (Gen. 1:28; 9:1) Having this vision of Jehovah's purpose the consecrated people of God, meaning the “remnant” and the Jonadabs, have, during the year past, pushed forward with all their energy and zeal to serve God and to advance his Kingdom interests. This report sets out a brief resume of the work that has been done during the past year, and which report it is hoped will be to the aid and encouragement of those who love Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In April, 1938, a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was held in Australia. Learning of that approaching convention the Fascists and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy combine put forth their most strenuous efforts to prevent God’s people from assembling in convention and worshiping Jehovah in spirit and in truth. Public officials of Australia prevented the use of a public hall for the people there to assemble and worship God. Radio stations were forbidden by the government officials to broadcast the Kingdom message. The newspapers were used to publish divers and numerous false statements that would interfere with the convention. Every possible means was put forth by the Fascists and the Hierarchy crowd to prevent the people from learning about God’s kingdom under Christ. Concerning such overt acts of the wicked conspirators Jehovah speaks, at Psalm 2:4, as follows: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.” No doubt the Lord held in derision that combined opposition that raised its hideous head at Sydney, Australia. All their efforts failed to prevent many people from hearing. The largest hall there available would accommodate only about four thousand persons. Because the use of that hall was denied Christian people, they were forced to engage an open park; and at the public meeting there assembled 25,000 persons, who heard the Kingdom message and who also learned that the Fascist-Hierarchy combine are operating a racket by which the people are ensnared and fleeced and their liberties destroyed and the way to the Kingdom blocked, so far as it is possible for such wicked agencies to block it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then in a few days thereafter at Auckland, New Zealand, a one-day convention of God’s consecrated people was held. There the Hierarchy-Fascist combine and their newspapers put forth their best endeavors to prevent the people from hearing the Kingdom message, and again they failed. Although the public address was delivered at the noon hour on Monday and during a downpour of rain, four thousand people crowded into the hall to hear the good news of the Kingdom and to learn of the nefarious work of the totalitarian monstrosity combine which attempts to destroy all the liberties of the people. Both at Sydney and in New Zealand the public assembly unanimously adopted resolutions disapproving the action of the Hierarchy and the Fascists and emphasizing the importance of the people’s placing themselves under the protection of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the return to America a brief stop was made at Suva, Fiji Islands, which is a crown colony of the British Empire. There a hall had been taken by contract and a public meeting advertised. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies succeeded in closing the hall and preventing the people from meeting there. The acting governor of the Fiji Islands, himself a Roman Catholic and a tool of the Papacy, in the absence of the regular governor, had issued an order forbidding the importation of literature and phonograph records, or any publications of the Watch Tower, and thus an effort was made to keep the people of the Fiji Islands from learning the truth. The public lecture delivered at Sydney, Australia, had been recorded. A few days after the afore-mentioned public meeting was prohibited the recorded speech was reproduced by phonograph to the public at Suva, and, by the Lord’s grace, they did hear the Kingdom message and learned something of the nefarious conduct of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in June a convention of God’s people was arranged for at Seattle, Washington. The enemy, learning of the approaching convention, did everything possible to prevent the people from hearing at that place. Led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and ably supported by the Fascists, and the newspapers, a vigorous campaign was staged against God’s kingdom and his witnesses. The public press was furnished with the facts but, because of fear of the Hierarchy and Fascists, or because of being a part of the combine, refused to give publication to the facts. Such opposition did not deter Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in carrying forward their work. By means of handbills and signs carried by the various witnesses the meeting for the public was advertised, and on Sunday the great public hall was filled to overflowing and many heard by means of loud-speakers bn the outside, and again the monstrosity was exposed and God’s kingdom advertised, and the result was that many persons were made free from religious bondage and earnestly thereafter sought the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>ENLARGED CONVENTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">September 9-11 was set apart for a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in various parts of the earth. At Royal Albert Hall, London, England, was the key convention, from which point the message was carried by means of land wires and radio to fifty other public halls in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Into those various halls thousands of people crowded to hear. The total audience in these halls was, to wit, 150,000 persons. In the United States alone 118 radio stations broadcast the Kingdom message, and that invisible audience, while not known, of course, exactly, must have numbered several million. On the 10th of September the subject of the lecture was “Fill the Earth”, the same being an exposition and explanation of God’s commandment originally given to Adam and restated to Noah and his sons, and which is shown by the Scriptures to apply specifically to the “great multitude” who will be permitted to carry out that divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous race of people, and this they will do during the thousand-year reign of Christ. That message was of great encouragement and comfort to the Jonadabs. On Sunday the 11th the subject of the lecture was “Face the Facts”. In this lecture the evidence was brought forth completely proving the conspiracy formed and now in operation between the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Fascists, the Nazis, and the Communists, which together form the hideous monstrosity, pictured by Goliath. That message opened the eyes of a multitude of people, disclosing to them the wickedness of that combine forming the monstrosity, and thousands of people have so expressed themselves by letter and telegram and otherwise, and made known their desire to find refuge and safety under Christ and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Overt acts of wickedness committed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies on the occasion of those conventions completely prove the conspiracy against Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ. In every land to which the Kingdom message was carried from London the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies fought desperately to prevent the people from hearing. Their newspapers published all manner of lies against God’s consecrated people in their endeavor to prevent others from attending. In many places the Hierarchy tried to induce the owners of halls to refuse the use of such halls for conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses, and in some places, such as New Orleans, Louisiana, they succeeded. Thereafter other halls were engaged and one after another contracts for such were canceled and the halls closed; when the people assembled in an open-air lot or field in New Orleans to worship God in spirit and in truth and to hear the message of the Kingdom, police officers, under the direction of the Roman Catholic bishop, prevented the people from hearing the London speech, which officers, with their guns ready, threatened to kill anyone who interfered with them in their unlawful conduct of cutting the wires that transmitted the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Rochester, New York, it was necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to obtain an order of court before they could open a rented hall, where the Lord’s people assembled to hear the truth. It was the Roman Catholic bishop who caused that hall to be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Chicago, Illinois, Catholic officials conspired together to prevent the people from assembling and worshiping God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Colorado Springs, Colorado, the Hierarchy and their dupes joined in a petition to the radio stations, demanding the cancellation of a contract to broadcast the message to the people, and induced the local newspaper to publish deliberate lies to prevent the people from hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Ottawa, Canada, the Roman Catholic crowd sent approximately 150 French Catholic Fascists who attempted to break up the public meeting. These instances are here cited merely to show that the Fascists, the Catholic Hierarchy, and the Nazis combine together, and constitute the chief part of the monstrosity afore-mentioned, and wickedly and viciously oppose God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. The physical facts, therefore, fully support and make clear the prophetic picture which Jehovah made long ago, showing that the monstrosity would desperately fight against his kingdom under Christ and attempt to destroy all the liberties of the people in the time in which we are now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On October 2 a public address was delivered at New York city on the subject “Fascism or Freedom”. The visible audience there assembled, and who were able to crowd into halls provided, were, to wit, seven thousand persons, and great numbers also were turned away. Sixty-two radio stations were engaged to broadcast that message in the United States, and most of those stations did broadcast the message, the exception being two that were induced by the Hierarchy and Fascists to cut off the program. This is further corroborative proof that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their Fascist allies are against God and against his kingdom under Christ and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses merely because they tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The influence of the Hierarchy is further shown in what came to pass at New Orleans about this time. Because of the threats and of the cutting of the telephone wires by police officers at the instance of the Catholic organization in that city, Jehovah’s witnesses filed a petition in the Federal Court for an injunction, that they might assemble peaceably and hear the message of truth on October 2. The judge of that court, doubtless acting under the counsel of representatives of the Hierarchy, called before him the police officers, Catholic newspaper editors and others who were made defendants, and obtained from them a promise that they would not interfere with the meetings on October 2, and, upon such promise being made, the court continued the case until the 7th of October. At the hearing of that case on October 7, although numerous witnesses testified to the threats made by police and to the fact that the police cut the telephone wires and prevented the speech from being heard from London and, with their hands on their guns, threatened to shoot to kill anyone who interfered, the judge of the court, after hearing all this evidence, called to the witness stand one McNamara, the policeman who commanded the police squad, and McNamara testified under oath that he made no threats whatsoever. Of course, he perjured himself, and upon the strength of that perjured testimony the court dismissed the injunction proceedings, further showing the combined efforts of the political, commercial, judicial and religious elements to prevent the people from learning of God’s kingdom under Christ. Immediately following this action in New Orleans Catholic officials in a nearby town arrested Jehovah’s witnesses, who were distributing the Kingdom message in printed form, and charged Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with distributing Fascist literature;</span><span class="font5"> and, without any proof whatsoever supporting the charge, Jehovah’s witnesses thus charged were convicted and sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment and to the payment of a fine of $100 each. This is further evidence of the combined efforts of the Fascisttotalitarian combine to fight against God’s kingdom. Amidst this opposition Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions go joyfully on, continuing with all their power to declare this gospel of the Kingdom as commanded by the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are made up of a large number of persons who are consecrated to Jehovah God and who have associated themselves together in the common cause and work which God has commanded all such consecrated persons to engage in, that is, the work of proclaiming his message of truth as contained in the Bible for the benefit of the people. Said witnesses therefore constitute a voluntary association. To carry on their work and hold and perpetuate title to their property a corporation or corporations are necessary. In the state of New York the Peoples Pulpit Association, created and organized under the membership corporation law, holds title to all property of Jehovah’s witnesses that is held within that state, and therefore is the corporation of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Peoples Pulpit Association is a non-stock and nonprofit corporation. It pays no dividends and no salaries, and all service rendered by those associated with it is rendered without pecuniary profit save only the necessities of life, such as food and raiment and incidental expenses. The money which was used to purchase its property, and that which is used to support the work it carries on, was and is derived from contributions made by persons interested in the kingdom of God under Christ. All of its money so received is paid out for the purpose of carrying on its work of doing good by publishing literature and distributing it amongst the people, by which the gospel is preached, as set forth in the Bible, God’s Word of truth. Jehovah’s witnesses and the corporation afore-mentioned have no desire to make money, and they receive no pecuniary profit whatsoever. No one associated with the corporation or the work of Jehovah’s witnesses receives pecuniary profit. The title to property of Jehovah’s witnesses outside of the state of New York is held either by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, or by the International Bible Students Association, incorporated under the laws of Great Britain. Neither of such corporations has any capital stock, and no one connected therewith receives any pecuniary profit. These corporations, therefore, were created and organized and are used exclusively to carry on the charitable, benevolent and Biblical instruction work in which Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged and to which they have devoted their lives, to the honor of Jehovah God and to the good of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Statute of New York exempting property from taxation is as follows: “The real property of a corporation or association organized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men and women or for religious, Bible, tract, charitable, benevolent, missionary, hospital, infirmary, educational, public playground, scientific, literary, bar association, library, patriotic, historical or cemetery purposes ... or for two or more such purposes and used exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more of such purposes . . . shall be exempt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The plain and clear purpose of the law of the State of New York is to exempt from taxation property so held by the Peoples Pulpit Association, as aforesaid. That law, in substance, provides that property used exclusively “for religious, Bible, tract, charitable, benevolent, missionary, hospital, infirmary, educational, . . . purposes ... or for two or more such purposes” is exempt from taxation. It is generally understood by almost everyone that all associations of persons or organizations made up of Christian people, who engage in study and worship, are religious organizations. Within the meaning of the law all Christian organizations are considered religious organizations, but according to the Bible definition there is a difference between religion and Christianity. Any formal worship of a superior or supreme being by persons who rely upon traditional teachings of men, together with texts of the Bible, is a religious organization. A Christian is one who strictly adheres to the Word of Almighty God as contained alone in the Bible and uses the Bible as his guide and worships the Almighty God Jehovah in spirit and in truth, and does so without indulging in formal ceremonies. Christ Jesus was the beginning of Christianity, and his true followers are Christians. Christ Jesus was never a religionist, and his followers, therefore, are not religionists, within the Biblical meaning of that term. But from the legal point of view all religious and Christian organizations are put in the same class, and hence the property of all such has the benefit of the taxexemption laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question of tax exemption of the Peoples Pulpit Association property was, about the year 1913, fully considered by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, presided over by Mr. Justice Callahan, and that court, after hearing all the facts, entered judgment in favor of the Peoples Pulpit Association, holding that its property is exempt from taxation. That judgment became final, because no appeal was prosecuted. For a time thereafter the Peoples Pulpit Association’s property was exempted from taxation. Later, for some reason, its property was again put on the tax list, although the conditions in relation to said corporation and its property had in no wise changed since the judgment was entered by Mr. Justice Callahan afore-mentioned. It appears, therefore, that the official authorities of the State of New York having to do with the taxation of property have ignored the ruling of the Supreme Court. Just why, or what influenced that official body to act toward the Peoples Pulpit Association, may be surmised. The Roman Catholic influence in the city and state of New York is very strong, and it appears that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy hold the opinion that no organization aside from the Catholic church organization is entitled to have its property exempt from taxation. In support of that conclusion so reached attention is here directed to a publication written and edited for the Department of Social Action of the National Catholic Welfare Council, which was organized by the late James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore. This, publication is a book entitled &quot;The State and the Church”, written and edited by Reverend John A. Ryan and Rev. Moorehouse F. X. Miller, S.J., issued under “imprimatur” of Patrick Cardinal Hayes, published in 1924 by Macmillan &amp;&nbsp;Company, New York. At page 38 of that book the following appears:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Constitutions can be changed, and non-Catholie sects may ri epiine to such a point that the political proscription of them may become feasible and expedient. What protection would they have against a Catholic state? The latter could logically tolerate only such religious activities as were confined to the members of the dissenting group. It could not permit them to carry on general propaganda nor accord their organization certain privileges that had formerly been extended to all religious corporations, for example, exemption from taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This same book contains an exposition of what the Roman Catholic Church organization requires in respect to the suppression of free will. At page 32 the author quotes Pope Leo XIII as follows: “The state must not only have care for religion but recognize the true religion. This means the form of religion professed by the Catholic church.” It therefore clearly appears that the Catholic organization arrogantly holds that no other body of persons is entitled to the benefits that are enjoyed by the Catholic organization. At page 36 the foregoing book further states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that the individual may in good faith think that his false religion is true gives no more right to propagate it than the sincerity of the alien anarchist entitles him to advocate his abominable political theories in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is some indication as to what would come to pass in the United States should the Catholics gain entire control of the country. Every sincere and honest person knows that Catholics have the right to propagate their theories in the United States, but they have no right to deny to others what the laws of the United States and the States provide for its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The property of the Peoples Pulpit Association, owned and used for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on their work, is used exclusively for charitable, benevolent and Bible instruction purposes. It is a charitable corporation, within the meaning of that term, because it exhibits the love which Christ manifests for mankind. It is a benevolent corporation, within the meaning of the law, because it is used to do good unto all persons as it has opportunity, possessing and manifesting love for mankind, and puts forth an honest endeavor to promote man’s prosperity and happiness. Instead of being permitted to enjoy the privileges now as it once did for some years past, the Peoples Pulpit Association is again compelled to litigate in the courts its right of exemption from taxation, and this includes the property of the Bethel home, the property of the publishing plant, and the radio station on Staten Island, all of which are used exclusively to carry out the purposes of preaching the gospel and advancing the interest of the kingdom of God. Jehovah’s witnesses, by and through the Peoples Pulpit Association and the other corporations mentioned, devote exclusively everything they have or own, and all that they receive, to charitable, benevolent and Biblical instruction purposes for the benefit of mankind and to the honor of the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The opposition against Jehovah’s witnesses and the afore-mentioned corporation, the Peoples Pulpit Association, relative to taxation, without a question of doubt emanates from that religious organization which has a selfish, political desire to control all the affairs of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In contrast to the action taken against the Peoples Pulpit Association attention is here called to the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization own millions of dollars’ worth of property within the City of New York, and much acreage of improved and unimproved land on Staten Island, New York, and none of which property is assessed for taxation. Any fair-minded person can draw his own conclusion as to just why the Peoples Pulpit Association is subjected to the unfair treatment relative to taxation of its property. If the Peoples Pulpit Association is compelled to pay taxes assessed against its property, then every penny used to pay the same must come out of the pockets of persons who contribute their money to carry on a benevolent, charitable and Biblical work and who receive no pecuniary profit themselves. The proper theory of taxation is that property used which brings a pecuniary profit or return should be taxed, but where it brings in no pecuniary profit but is used exclusively for charitable and benevolent purposes or Biblical instruction, and supported by voluntary contribution, it should not be subject to taxation. Not one cent of pecuniary profit is derived from the Peoples Pulpit Association property in the City of New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>PREACH THIS KINGDOM GOSPEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In brief, the mission and work of Jehovah’s witnesses is that of preaching this gospel of the Kingdom in obedience to the command of the Lord. (Matt. 24:14) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gospel</span><span class="font5"> means good news, and this gospel of the Kingdom is, to wit, that the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ has come and that as soon as the Lord eliminates Satan and his organization, God’s kingdom will bring forth lasting blessings to all who desire peace, prosperity, life and happiness. This is not only good news, but the best news that was ever brought to mankind, and all honest and sincere persons, regardless of previous religious faith, are anxious to hear this gospel. Every person who becomes a true follower of Christ Jesus is commissioned, “ordained” and commanded to preach this gospel of the Kingdom for the aid and comfort of the people. (Isa. 61:1, 2) Every one who is a true follower of Christ Jesus must proclaim the truth as contained in God’s Word, and this gospel of the Kingdom is the truth. (John 18: 36, 37) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its press charge that Jehovah’s witnesses carry on a campaign of hate. There is not the slightest justification for such a charge. They are not engaged in a hate of any individuals, but are engaged solely in proclaiming the truth. The truth is not proclaimed for the purpose of holding up others to ridicule, but for the purpose of bringing comfort to oppressed humankind. For many long centuries the human race has been under the dominating influence of Satan and his visible agents, and now the time has come for the people to learn how they may escape that oppression and find the salvation and blessings which Jehovah God has provided for them. Jehovah’s witnesses must tell the people about these truths. The truth when told necessarily exposes Satan and wickedness. The truth is sharp and cutting, and concerning the effect of God’s Word of truth it is written: “For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discemer of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”—Heb. 4:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is no wonder, then, that when the truth of God’s Word is told it shocks the religious susceptibilities of men who use religion as a racket and reap great pecuniary profit therefrom. It is not at all surprising that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy howl when the Bible is brought to the people and explained to them. For instance, one of the pet doctrines of the Catholic Hierarchy is that of “purgatory”, whereas the Scriptures plainly show that no one dies and goes to “purgatory”; that there is no person in “purgatory” suffering punishment, and that certainly no human creature can do the dead good by uttering prayers. The “purgatory” doctrine has for a long while been the means of extracting large sums of money from poor and rich who rely upon the word of Catholic priests, and who have no knowledge of the Word of God; and when the truth is told to the people the clergy howl, and, as the Scriptures say, their howling is due to the fact that their lucrative pastures are being spoiled and their revenue taken away. (Jer. 25:33-36) The clergy tell the people that they are the representatives of God and Christ and that they can pray for those in “purgatory” and relieve their “suffering”, particularly when money is contributed by the living for the purpose of having such prayers uttered. There is no reason why they should thus deceive the people; and the facts clearly show that they are by such means obtaining money under false pretenses, because the clergy do not represent God and Christ in any kind of racket. God and Christ cannot be parties to fleecing the people. The Devil well knows that the clergy, practicing religion, turn the people away from an intelligent worship of God and hence the people, when learning the truth, see they have been deceived by religionists and they flee to God. That makes the Devil and his religious agents very angry. The Devil tries to keep the religious practices alive and a going concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preaching this gospel of the Kingdom is not limited to words spoken by individual creatures. The more effective way is to encourage the people to read the plain truth as it is written, and the explanation of which is published in books and in magazine form. Jehovah’s witnesses employ the printed message by publishing and placing in the hands of millions of people books and magazines, and at the present time these are going into the hands of the people in 78 different languages. The witnesses of Jehovah go about from place to place, exhibit such publications to the people, and encourage them to study the same in connection with the Bible. Also the spoken message is recorded on discs and phonographs, and transcription machines are used to reproduce these spoken sermons. During the past year more than 25,000 of such soundequipment machines have been employed to preach this gospel of the Kingdom within the hearing of the people. These sermons reproduced daily by many thousands of records are bringing the message of the Kingdom to the attention of millions of sincere persons. The result during the past year is that many millions of honest and sincere Catholics and non-Catholics have heard this gospel message of truth and, learning such truths, they have immediately fled from the religious institutions and have found refuge and protection and peace in Christ and they henceforth delight to tell others about these great truths. The more the message of truth is spoken, the greater is the anger of the Devil and his religious traffickers and the more strenuous and malicious are the efforts put forth by these religionists to persecute Jehovah's witnesses. They use their newspapers to publish divers and numerous false statements about Jehovah’s witnesses. They boycott, threaten, and browbeat owners of radio stations, and owners of public halls, to prevent the people from hearing the truth. By means of persecution the Hierarchy hopes to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. These opponents, however, overlook the fact that this is Jehovah God’s “strange work” and no power can successfully resist the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To give a full and complete report of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses during the fiscal year would require far more space than is here allotted. A brief outline, therefore, of the work throughout the earth is here set out, and it is hoped that the same may be of much encouragement and bring much joy to those who have participated in that work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>AMERICA (UNITED STATES OF)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From Brooklyn, New York, the systematic work of Jehovah’s witnesses is directed. Believing that the Society is the visible servant of the Lord on earth, we confidently expect Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, to guide the work to his own glory. The relationship that his prophet Jeremiah sustained to Jerusalem was a type of the relationship of Jehovah’s witnesses to the present-day “Christendom”, which professes to be followers of Christ. Jeremiah was commanded to warn Jerusalem of her impending doom because she had forsaken the Lord and turned to religion. Jerusalem failed to heed that warning and was destroyed. Likewise Jehovah commands his witnesses now on the earth to give warning to “Christendom” of her impending doom. Accordingly the warning is now being given. A small proportion of the people will give heed to that warning. “Christendom” in general will ignore it. Her destruction will be the result. Such is God’s express purpose to cause such warning to be given before he clears off all opposition that the way may be entirely clear for his righteous government to function to his glory and for the good of humankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus, having been enthroned by Jehovah and now at the temple of the Most High, is directing the work of those who are anointed by the Lord. To these he reveals from time to time a clearer vision of Jehovah’s purpose. During the fiscal year the anointed have been made to see and understand more clearly than heretofore that Jehovah’s organization is the great theocracy and that the work on the earth is directed by the Lord Jesus Christ, his Executive Officer, and therefore the Society, being the visible agency of the Lord on earth, must act under the Lord’s direction and supervision. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> for the month of June, 1938, contains the Scriptural explanation of God’s prophecy at Isaiah 60:17, thereby disclosing that in these days God has brought his organization on earth into a compact form that those who participate therein may carry out his will. All of Jehovah’s witnesses are familiar with that explanation in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> In harmony therewith the entire field has been divided into zones, and over each zone a servant appointed who acts under the direction of the Society’s headquarters, and the duties of each zone servant are fully set out in the instructions given to him. Each company has its servant, who is also appointed by the Society. In this manner the entire organization is one compact body, all acting in unity and in full harmony with but one thing in view, and that to advance the Kingdom interests of Jehovah and to participate in the vindication of his holy name. From every part of the earth the members of the companies have responded with great joy that the Lord has thus brought about the unity and harmonious action of his organization. It is to be expected that henceforth everyone connected with the visible organization, both of the remnant and of their companions, will carefully follow organization instructions, to the end that everything may be done to the glory of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointed followers of Christ Jesus now on earth are few in number, and never will their number be greater. These are designated in the Scriptures as &quot;the remnant” of the offspring of Zion, God’s organization. (Rev. 12:17) The Lord is now gathering to himself his &quot;other sheep”, who will form the &quot;great multitude”. (John 10:16) Those now being gathered are companions of the remnant, working together with the remnant. From this time forward those composing the &quot;other sheep” will increase in number until the &quot;great multitude” is gathered. Some persons, evidently due to selfishness and blindness resulting from the enemy’s influence, have insisted that there is now no evidence of the &quot;great multitude”. But in this they have been greatly deceived. Mark this one small evidence of the coming of the &quot;great multitude”, namely, on the 11th of September, 1938: On that one day in the United States 1,818 persons were immersed all of whom are of the “other sheep” of the Lord, or Jonadabs. Those &quot;other sheep” submit themselves to baptism or immersion as an outward testimony that they have found refuge in Christ Jesus and have given their entire allegiance to his righteous government. Many other persons are awakening to the importance of this hour and are fleeing to the Lord. The totalitarian-Fascist-Hierarchy rule is now clearly seen by great numbers of persons and recognized as &quot;the abomination of desolation” and, seeing this, the people of good will give heed to the Lord’s command and are fleeing to his kingdom, rejoicing in the privilege of being his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year now ended has seen the greatest witness ever given on earth to the Lord’s theocratic government, and this has come about in the face of the most determined and vicious opposition ever put forth by the Hierarchy and allied enemies of God’s kingdom. In many countries the witness work has been next to impossible because of the opposition, but in those countries where there is still some freedom of opinion and action the greater amount of witness work has been done, and the United States of America is among such. Still some freedom of action is enjoyed in this land, and this is exercised only in the face of great opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s printing plant operated at Brooklyn during the year has produced the Kingdom message in literature of 37 different languages, and in other countries printing plants have produced the same literature, until the Kingdom message now goes forth in 78 different languages, advising the peoples that God’s kingdom is here and of the blessings that it will bring to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All branch servants of the Society, which are maintained in different countries, make report to the president’s office. The Society at Brooklyn headquarters has a servant who is in charge of the printing plaqt and office and who also makes report. For this year he has filed his report, and from that report the following is copied and inserted herewith as a part of the president’s annual report, to wit:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The four-story addition to the factory at 117 Adams Street surely was a provision of the Lord; for without it it would have been impossible to handle the work that had to be done during the past twelve months. The witness in the field required a greater production than ever before, and there was an average of 146 persons working throughout the year, an increase of 5 over the previous year. At one time as many as 150 were required in the factory to handle the work. There were 270| regular work days, but it was necessary, in addition to this, to operate the factory and office 84 hours extra time, equal to about ten days, in order to keep up with the demand for literature. Certain parts of the factory were required to put in even more time. A skeleton force was held in the factory during the vacation period in order to keep things moving and meet the demand. This was the first year that the factory did not shut down at any time during the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following report of production compared with the previous year clearly shows why all this was necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Books and booklets printed in this factory during the year were printed in 37 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In manufacturing the above, 2,064 tons of paper and 150 tons of chipboard were used. This is equal to more than 110 carloads of paper alone, or 13 carloads more than we used last year. Additionally, there were used 228,985 yards of cloth for covers, 3,319 rolls of gold tape, 41,600 yards of crash, 645 spools of thread, and large quantities of other materials. In our own plant we manufactured 33,181 pounds of ink for the presses, and 429 gallons of paint to keep the buildings in repair. We also manufacture our own paste and glue, and during the year produced 84 barrels of paste and 15,606 pounds of glue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Several new machines were installed which aided greatly in producing better and more books. Our plate department was improved during the year by obtaining a new curved-plate shaver, and an 800-ton Directomat, used for molding and drying mats, from which are made the curved plates for the presses. We also secured a new three-knife trimmer, and a 10-inch saw for our carpenter shop.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> exceeded all previous books as far as shipments in one year’s time are concerned. During the year 1,836,207 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> were shipped out in English alone. The grand total of books shipped during the year exceeded our production by more than 160,000. From the Brooklyn factory and its depots 2,879,978 books were shipped out. Booklets reached a grand total of 21,633,006. There were 25,052 Bibles dispatched, bringing the grand total of books, booklets and Bibles to 24,538,036. Of this amount, 2,894,306 were in foreign languages. Compared with last year, shipments show a tremendous increase in bound books, and a decrease in booklets and Bibles. The call for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font5"> was exceedingly high, reaching a total of 461,569. In booklets, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> exceeded everything else. We shipped out 10,821,546. Following that came </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety,</span><span class="font5"> with a little over 3,000,000, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font5"> with 2,760,000. Literature was shipped to all parts of the world, in 51 languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>SHIPMENTS OF SOUND EQUIPMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the heavy demand for phonographs it was impossible for several months to keep the production high enough to fill the orders. However, toward the end of the year we finally caught up and were able to stock a few. During the year 10,134 phonographs were shipped out. Of the other sound equipments we manufactured, such as sound-car equipments No. 3 and No. 4, a total of 82 were shipped out. These sound-car equipments include a dual-speed turntable which is mounted inside the car. The horn is held securely on the roof of the car by vacuum cups. There is no finer equipment made for outdoor reproduction of voice or music. The Society is now able to fill orders immediately for sound equipment No. 4, which is offered on a contribution of $140. Phonographs are also available for immediate shipment, and these are offered at $10 each, including three discs containing six of Judge Rutherford’s lectures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>RECORDINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Along with the sound equipment which is used for the preaching of the gospel there were shipped out 146,025 English discs, which contained approximately 300,000 lectures. Additionally, these same recordings in foreign languages w<sup>r</sup>ere shipped out to the amount of 14,907. The Society’s male quartet records reached 3,213, bringing the grand total of dises shipped out to 164,145. During the past year there were brought into use some excellent recordings, namely, records Nos. P-103 to P-113, containing the lecture “Safety”; P-114, “Enemies,” an introduction to the book by the same name; P-115 to P-124, “Worshiping God”; A-125 to A-135, “Warning”; A-136, “For Liberty”; A-137, A-138, “Awake”; P-139 to P-150, “Violence”; P-151, “Relief”; P-152, “Resolution.” This makes a total of 50 new recordings put to use during the year in the English language. Of the “Enemies” record alone more than 25,000 have been put into use in the field throughout the world. Many of the phonograph lectures have been translated and recorded in other languages. Records are now available at Brooklyn in the following languages: English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hollandish, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Spanish, Ukrainian. This is a total of 17 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing that there would be a tremendous demand for the thrilling lectures “Face the Facts” and “Fill the Earth”, the Society had these lectures recorded at the time of delivery at Royal Albert Hall. “Fascism or Freedom,” another powerful lecture that everyone will want, has also been recorded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">books and 12,803,429 booklets placed, making a grand total of 14,701,875. This is the greatest distribution of literature ever made in the United States during a period of twelve months. Compared with last year it is an increase of about 2,100,000. Placement of bound books exceeded that of last year by more than 400,000, which increase was due principally to the wide distribution of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font5"> The publishers everywhere have eagerly placed this book in the hands of the people. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> booklet had a wider distribution than any other individual publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s rich blessing was upon his people and it is very evident that the “multitude” is now being assembled and that the “companions” of Jehovah’s witnesses are joining in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. The previous year there was an average of 21,454 publishers in the field, and this year finds a great increase, the average being 25,596. During the year, however, a peak of publishers was reached of 31,351 in June. In April we also passed the 30,000 mark, with 30,733. This proves conclusively that the Lord’s “other sheep” are being brought into his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The devotion of these publishers to Jehovah and to his work in the interest of the Kingdom can be best appreciated by the number of hours put in the field, and this year, in the United States, 6,141,409 hours were spent in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people appreciate more than ever before the need and usefulness of the sound equipment, and their activity in this regard is very gratifying. During the year 13,070,426 persons heard the lectures as reproduced on sound ears and phonographs. Those who showed exceptional interest were called on again, and the report shows that since we have been keeping a record of back calls 289,489 back calls were made on interested persons by the publishers. This feature of the work has greatly aided the people of good will in getting a proper understanding of the truth, and it is probably due to this that there has been a greater increase in publishers than in previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the outstanding features of the year were the testimony periods. Beginning last year with the “King of Kings” period (except by those who had a supply of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font5"> obtained at the Columbus convention) the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bielies</span><span class="font5"> and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font5"> were stressed. A definite effort was made from the first of October to increase the number of publishers, and there was a steady increase from then on until the peak of 31,351 was reached, in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the month of December came the first worldwide distribution of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety, </span><span class="font5">and there were placed nearly 200,000 bound books that month alone, with 700,000 booklets. From then on it was practically impossible for the factory at Brooklyn to keep the branches and the companies in the United States supplied with literature. Never has there been such a demand in the field for a bound book as for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font5"> It caused the “enemies” to howl, and such howling was particularly manifested in Connecticut, where the religionists caused the arrest of many of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest campaign of the year was that with the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font5"> the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> and the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> This campaign began in April, and in the first month we reached our quota of 30,000 publishers. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> was commented on by almost every Catholic paper in the country, but this did not slow down its distribution. Rather, it aroused more interest on the part of honest Catholics, and millions of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> booklet went into the homes of these “prisoners”. More responses were received in the Brooklyn office due to this booklet than to any other publication distributed to date. Thousands of people took advantage of the special offer appearing on the last page of this booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> being offered with a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> greatly increased the circulation of this magazine. In the United States alone during the three months’ campaign 73,006 new subscriptions were obtained. During this three-month period wonderful results were obtained in the back-call work, and since that time in particular the brethren have appreciated the great importance of making back calls. All of the new subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> have been given the opportunity of hearing the lectures by phonograph, and many of these now appreciate their privilege of representing the King of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only has the work gone on grandly in the United States, but the outlying countries that have reported to the Brooklyn office have also done splendidly. There were 264 publishers in these outlying territories, and they distributed 154,081 books and booklets. They also put to excellent use the sound equipment, and nearly a quarter of a million people listened to the Kingdom message by this means in these outlying countries. The back-call work is beginning to gain momentum there. Thus far they reported 820 back calls made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Company organizations, pioneers and auxiliaries are very well equipped to carry on the warfare. Not only do they have an abundant supply of literature, magazines, handbills and other publications, but they also have sound equipment and records, which is one of the most important instruments in use today in the proclamation of the Kingdom. The following sound equipment is in use: 18,576 phonographs, 650 portable transcription machines, 450 sound-ear equipments. These are sending forth a mighty shout, well over 13,000,000 people hearing the message during the year, by that means alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the literature placed by publishers in the United States and outlying countries, many books and booklets are sent direct by the Brooklyn office to people who write in, having become interested in a book or booklet left in their home and desiring to learn more about the Kingdom. To such people 40,319 books were shipped out, and 68,856 booklets. For every one of these interested people writing in, a back call slip is made and sent to the nearest company, pioneer or auxiliary, and they in turn make calls on these people with phonographs and records and assist them in getting a clear knowledge of the truth. During the fiscal year 291,986 letters and cards were received by the Brooklyn office, and in answer to this mail 286,693 letters and cards were dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the year the company organizations throughout the country are in far better shape than they ever were heretofore. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of June 1 and 15 pointed out so clearly the theocratic arrangement which is essential to progress that the brethren everywhere have taken hold of the organization instructions with great zeal and enthusiasm. The reorganization of companies that you outlined became effective October 1, 1938. These details have been sent out and are in full operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The care with which Jehovah is directing his people in the new organization arrangement gives evidence that we must be prepared for the care of the “great multitude”. The organization as now set out is capable of expanding to any degree. The activity in the field gives added proof that the time had come for this to be done. From 1919 up to and including 1934, a period of sixteen years, the publishers reporting to the Brooklyn office distributed 60,069,595 pieces of literature. From 1935, at which time the “great multitude” was revealed, up to and including 1938, a period of only four years, the distribution of literature reached 56,031,016. These figures show that almost as much literature was put out in four years as in the previous sixteen. Additionally, the sound equipment came into use in the last four years, and millions of people have heard through this means. Jehovah is organizing his people for this continued expansion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>BETHEL HOME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not only do the members of the family care for the work in the home, the radio and the factory and farms, but they spend much time in the field carrying the message to the people. During 1938 the family put in 30,281 hours in witnessing from door to door and in back-call work. This is approximately 7,000 more hours than the previous year, even though much extra time was devoted in the factory and office to keep up with the big demand for literature. The report which follows exceeds by far anything that the family has done in the field heretofore.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On September 26, 1937, the president of the Society made the announcement in the speech “Worshiping God” that commercial contracts with radio stations would terminate at the end. of October, 1937. It was further announced that a greater work would be carried on by the use of sound equipment in an entirely new manner, and this was begun with the special pioneer service. It was announced in the speech “Worshiping God” that any station that would take the program free each week would be furnished records at no cost to them. Since that time 4,478 transcription broadcasts were made over 7 stations throughout the United States. Although the weekly broadcast service terminated, this did not end the chain broadcasts, because, when the Lord has important messages to send forth, his servants use every means available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On June 5, from the Civic Auditorium in Seattle, 34 stations simultaneously broadcast the speech on “Violence”. It was recorded at the same time, and these records have been used extensively in further</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sending forth this message. During the world-wide convention September 9-11 the speech “Fill the Earth”, delivered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, was transmitted by short-wave stations in Great Britain to the convention cities that comprised the world-wide convention setup. This lecture, “Fill the Earth,” was heard through the public-address systems at convention halls and additionally over station WBBR in New York city. The following day, September 11, the speech “Face the Facts” was delivered before a packed-out auditorium in London and was transmitted by short-wave stations in Great Britain to various convention cities. Public-address systems were installed in all of these halls, 47 in number, and simultaneously broadcast in the United States by 117 stations. Originally there were 138 stations engaged for this chain broadcast in America. Ten stations yielded to Hierarchy coercive tactics and refused at the last minute to fulfill their contracts. Ten other stations began the broadcast at the appointed time and discontinued after sending out about half of the talk, because it was “too hot” and there was too much pressure brought to bear by outside influence. Another station, St. Augustine, Fla., reported that it was unable to fulfill its contract on discovery a few minutes before the program time that the cable connections to the station studio and transmitter had been mysteriously cut. This message by radio greatly aroused the religionists, and they have set up a tremendous howl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of their groaning and squawks, another broadside was let loose on them on October 2. A special expose of Hierarchy-Fascist action in America was sent forth October 2 by 58 stations. “Fascism or Freedom” was the speech delivered before a large audience at the Mecca Temple, New York, and relayed by telephone lines to public-address systems in New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Columbus, and Seattle, as well as Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. At the same time it was broadcast in the United States in a eoast-to-coast network of 58 stations. Of a total of 65 stations engaged for the chain, five yielded to coercion and refused at the last minute to fulfill their contracts. Two other stations carried part of the program and then Cut it off with an apology to their listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other things, two outstanding elements have been brought clearly into view through these special chain broadcasts: first, that there are men in the United States in control of radio stations who will not yield to threats of boycott and other racketeering methods used &quot;by Hierarchy agents to carry out their wicked will against the public interests, and, second, Hierarchy &quot;eminences” such as the bishop of Seattle, the bishop of Savannah at Atlanta, Ga., and other religionists now openly and profusely, but thus far unsuccessfully, display themselves in writing many threatening letters to coerce station owners and managers. The Hierarchy directed school children who never heard the program to protest to the stations, and announced it in their churches to register protests. One station received 400 letters demanding that Judge Rutherford no longer broadcast on that station after the September 11 speech, but with all of these threats, this station took the program on October 2. This same station received hundreds of complimentary letters because of its firm stand for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of worship. The radio has cut deep into the hiding places of the religionists.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>PERSONAL VISITS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The radio has opened up many homes to Jehovah’s witnesses and their &quot;companions” for personal visits. People of good will hearing such courageous and straightforward truths given by Brother Rutherford over the radio have written for copies of the speeches. Their names and addresses are sent to the companyorganizations, and they in turn make personal visits on these people with phonographs and records. Those who will be a part of God’s kingdom must have an opportunity to hear the truth, and the report shows that thousands of these persons who have recently been visited by Jehovah’s witnesses are now also having a share in preaching the gospel. The back-call work has been stressed very much during the past year, and the field report shows 289,489 visits were made to persons desiring more truth. During the fiscal year approximately 19,600 sound machines have been employed to carry on this part of the witness work. More machines are being manufactured and sent out to the publishers daily so that this feature may be increased. In the last three years approximately 430,000 discs have been sent out by the Brooklyn office to the publishers for use in the field. This means that more than 860,000 speeches are available that can be heard, not only in the English language, but in 16 foreign languages. The importance of making personal visits on the newly interested cannot be overstated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>USE OF RECORDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are millions of people who have had the desire to hear Judge Rutherford deliver his lectures, and, it being impossible for him to get everywhere, the reproduction of his lectures on records has proved to be a great aid and comfort to those seeking righteousness. Some years ago the Society began to make electrically transcribed records which required 15 minutes to reproduce, and these were used on sound cars and transcription machines. It was soon learned that this reached only a certain portion of the people, and therefore Judge Rutherford’s lectures were then recorded on phonograph records which require 4J minutes to reproduce. The phonograph work has greatly-advanced the use of records, and now the sound cars and transcription machines are so equipped that they can use either the 12-inch 4|-minute records or the 16-inch 15-minute records. Personally meeting the people in their homes has proved most beneficial to the listeners, particularly those who are too poor to have radio receiving sets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>SPECIAL PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the Columbus convention in 1937 it was announced that a new branch of the service would be organized, namely, the special pioneer service. When this work began, in November, 1937, 151 persons were enrolled. This also marked the beginning of a definite effort to make personal visits on the people with phonographs, using the message contained on the records. In the first month there were 7,854 back calls reported by these special publishers. Throughout the year they became more efficient and appreciated to a greater extent their responsibility of being in this field. By the end of the year there was an average of 247 of these special pioneers in the field every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So that they might be able to use their phonographs more extensively and stress the point of making setups at every home possible, it was necessary for the Society to assist them in some pecuniary way to carry on this work, which expense was met by voluntary contributions. These 247 carried on their work particularly in the large cities, and they were a great encouragement to the brethren in the companies, because these brethren showed the company publishers how the back-call work could be carried on, and particularly how setups could be made at the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year these special pioneers made 682,324 phonograph setups and were able to arrange for 57,648 back calls. Those listening to the phonograph total 1,407,274. A splendid witness was given by this small group of special pioneers; and as they have moved forward averaging not less than 160 hours a month in the field, the other brethren not able to put in so much time have followed their lead and have diligently striven to make setups and back calls. The placements in the field by these 247 special pioneers are very gratifying. They placed 138,376 bound books and 637,509 booklets, making a grand total of 775,885 pieces of literature distributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>BOOKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has richly blessed his people during the year with new publications. The Lord caused to be brought forth the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font5"> which contained a most powerful message and had an unprecedented distribution. It cut severely the Catholic Hierarchy and all religion, and aided thousands to see clearly the distinction between religion and Christianity. This was followed by the 64-page colored-cover booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font5"> containing the lectures of the president of the Society as delivered at the Australian convention and the Seattle convention. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font5"> was released for the first time at the world-wide convention assembly September 9. It was a joy to all the publishers to have a share in distributing this booklet containing such an important message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1938 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book of Jehovah's witnesses,</span><span class="font5"> released early in the year, also brought much comfort to the anointed and their companions. Although we had no new bound book for public release during the year, the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> moved forward with such speed that it would have been impossible for the factory to publish a new book and keep up with the demand for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font5"> We began printing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> in September, 1937, and the edition on the present run at the end of September, 1938, was 2,365,000. It is interes</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tin</span><span class="font5">g, too, to note the edition number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font5"> which first went to press in November, 1935. Thus far we have printed 3,243,668. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font5"> the oldest bound book we have, was first published in October, 1921. To date at the Brooklyn office there have been printed of this book in all languages 5,736,190.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>SEATTLE CONVENTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">One of the outstanding events of the year for the Lord’s people was the Seattle convention, June 2-5, 1938. From the time of the announcement of the convention until it was over, there was stiff opposition by the religionists, who desperately tried to prevent the convention and the public lecture by Judge Rutherford. In the beginning the Chamber of Commerce offered the use of the Civic Auditorium to Jehovah’s witnesses free as an inducement to bring their convention to Seattle. However, when the clergy found out about it and exerted their influence upon the City Council and the Chamber of Commerce, the offer was withdrawn. Jehovah’s witnesses, then more determined than ever to hold a convention in Seattle to the honor of the Lord, rented the Civic Auditorium and paid for it at the usual commercial rate. This move took the religionists by surprise, and their anger knew no bounds. From then on, the clergy, headed by the Roman Catholic bishop of Seattle, did everything possible to interfere with the arrangements for the convention, and through much difficulty arrangements were finally made for a cafeteria, trailer camp and other facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An agreement was entered into with the Seattle </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> to publish a three-quarter-page report of the convention during each day of its sessions. Subscriptions to the number of more than 13,000 were sent in by Jehovah’s witnesses for the report. On the first day copy was submitted to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font5"> including a story of the Australian convention. That story about how the Hierarchy-Fascist opposition was squelched in Australia would have been most interesting news to the people of Seattle. However, the editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> was afraid of offending the religionists and wanted to strike out so much of the story that it would not have been fit to print. No amount of reasoning could convince him that the duty of the newspaper is to serve the American people, and not a foreign power. Because of fear, he preferred to remain silent, even though it meant the loss of many hundreds of dollars to the newspaper in refusing the subscriptions for the convention report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the president arrived at the convention and learned about the newspaper failure he submitted a resolution to . the convention, which was unanimously and enthusiastically adopted. This resolution was printed and widely spread throughout the city of Seattle, and the fight was on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the public meeting on Sunday, when Judge Rutherford delivered the lecture “Violence”, the hall was much too small to accommodate the crowd, and an overflow meeting was arranged in an adjoining ball park. There were, all together, more than 10,000 persons who attended the meeting, and thousands of names and addresses were turned in for a copy of the speech and a back call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A radio chain covering the entire Pacific Coast carried the lecture “Violence” from the Civic Auditorium in Seattle to thousands more, and this further aroused the malicious hatred of the Hierarchy. Threats of boycott and other bludgeon methods were used on station owners, but none of the stations cut the program, although several of the Washington stations were frightened into making public apologies in the newspapers, because of the Hierarchy’s threatening to ruin their business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another outstanding feature of the convention was Judge Rutherford’s talk to the convention on Saturday evening, attended by about 4,000, on the subject “Lovers of Righteousness”. With these words of comfort the brethren pressed on in the work of announcing the King and Kingdom. The publishers at the convention spent 12,796 hours in field service and placed a total of 52,454 books and booklets, with 36,263 interested people. They also used their phonographs extensively, running the lectures for 14,061 listeners.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>WORLD-WIDE CONVENTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah through his theocratic organization assembled his people in the greatest convention of all time. All told, there were 47 cities connected by direct wire, September 10 and 11, in which conventions were held, and other cities picked up the short-wave broadcast and feasted on the truth sent out. The president of the Society addressed all of these conventions by means of short-wave radio and transcontinental telephone lines. For such a setup the reception of both Saturday’s and Sunday’s speech from London was remarkable, and engineers handling this broadcast in all parts of the world were amazed at the unusual clarity with which the speeches were received. Overshadowing all this mechanical arrangement and the immensity of the setup, however, was the message that the Lord had for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saturday night, direct from Royal Albert Hall, London, came the proper understanding of God’s mandate to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">“fill</span><span class="font5"> the earth”. It was a joy to all to hear this most comforting message and see the responsibility which now rests upon the Jonadabs. Sunday’s lecture, “Face' the Facts,” was widely advertised throughout all of the world. A special effort was made in the United States and all other countries to inform the people of good will about the convention and to help them get to the nearest convention city. At the 23 convention cities in the United States there -were 33,798 persons who heard “Fill the Earth”. At the Sunday meeting there were 65,058. In addition to the visible audience, there were probably hundreds of thousands more who heard the lecture over the radio chain of 118 stations, which covered all of the United States and a goodly portion of Canada. This message was so pointed and the facts so clearly stated that the Hierarchy were aroused to greater action against the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With all the opposition, the greatest witness ever given by a convention was accomplished. Never before in a convention were there 20,469 publishers in the field. They worked 62,556 hours. There were distributed in the field 159,043 pieces of literature. Phonographs and sound cars were used to good effect, and in just three days 326,463 persons heard the lectures. A total of 1,393 back calls were made during the convention period. After the lecture “Fill the Earth”, 1,818 Jonadabs symbolized their consecration at the immersion service on Sunday morning. The Lord’s blessing was very manifest in every way on the detailed arrangements, all of which are covered in the special report by the Society published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil’s wicked crowd was again exposed on October 2, when the lecture “Fascism or Freedom” was delivered at Mecca Temple with 7,000 people present. Jehovah’s witnesses in New York city felt as though the world-wide convention had been extended to October 2, and they were greatly thrilled with the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every Catholic paper in the country and many other newspapers gave wide publicity to Jehovah’s witnesses and their work. Jehovah’s organization is better fitted than ever before, since this convention, to carry on the work at hand, and those of the Lord's organization fully appreciate that they are in an offensive warfare and must carry the battle into the camp of the enemy. The world-wide convention of September 9-11, inclusive, was a refreshing shower of blessings poured upon his people, and we rejoice in the provision God has made for the care of his organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGNS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There were two testimony periods of the year known as “international campaigns”. The first one was October 2-10; the second one, April 9-17, at the Memorial season. Each of them was for a period of nine days, and the witness given in these eighteen days'far exceeded the witness given in the same period in the previous year. The number of publishers was greatly increased. 50,769 placed 2,920,974 books and booklets. The report is set out below:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Another means adopted by the Fascist-Roman Catholic Hierarchy combine, who oppose the theocratic kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ, is for that combine to proceed against Jehovah’s witnesses by enacting ordinances and statutes by which the enemy brings about the arrest and imprisonment of the servants of Jehovah. Satan sits upon the throne of wickedness and directs his religious servants on the earth in their operations and persecution of Jehovah’s faithful servants. Those religious representatives of the Devil claim to the people that they have fellowship with Jehovah God and Christ, but their claims are entirely false. They represent the Devil and have no partnership or fellowship with God and his kingdom. This is fully supported by their constant and vicious opposition to the kingdom of God. To be sure, Jehovah foreknew this wicked opposition would come to pass at the present time, and long ago he caused his prophet to utter these prophetic words, to wit: “Shall the throne of wickedness [Satan’s throne] have fellowship [by and through his religious representatives on the earth] with thee [Jehovah God], which [that is, the agents of the Devil on earth] frameth mischief by statute? They [the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses, and God’s enemies] gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous [servants of Jehovah], and condemn the innocent blood; but Jehovah hath been my [Jehovah’s devoted servant’s] high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge.” (Ps. 94:20-22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.'V.) </span><span class="font5">Thus it is seen that God foretold that the Devil, acting in his mimic kingdom and mocking Jehovah God, sits on his throne of wickedness and directs his wicked representatives on the earth to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the duty and privilege of the Society so far as possible to defend and protect the faithful servants of God who are engaged in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom. To this end the Society is compelled to maintain a legal department, where legal counsel are kept busy constantly in defending Jehovah’s witnesses from the wicked persecution brought against them by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, and which persecution is in the form of legal proceedings. The Society’s legal counsel submits to the president his report, setting forth a brief review of the persecution by and through the means of statutes, and from which report the following is taken and here inserted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Comparison and Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This report shows a substantial decrease from the previous year’s total of 569. It does not indicate any decrease in the vicious, willful opposition of the religionists to the dissemination of the truth. In the large totals of arrests of some previous years there were many cases of mass arrests running into hundreds, which swelled the total. During the past year Connecticut was the only state that indulged in that form of opposition. Throughout the country there is a constant, steady opposition, which is manifested in many ways. Due to recent court decisions, however, this opposition is not as easily exercised as in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Integrity of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all parts of the country Jehovah’s witnesses and their &quot;companions”, the Jonadabs, are proving themselves tried and true fighters for the truth and righteousness. They do not quail or give up under attack by the enemy. They have consistently and steadily gone back into hostile territory; have declined to submit to threats or coercion; refused to pay fines, and have maintained a dignified and courageous attitude under stress. One police chief in New Jersey well stated, &quot;We don’t care to get tangled up with Jehovah’s witnesses, because if we do we know we will have a real fight on our hands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">U. S. Supreme Court Upholds Freedom of the Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ease of Lovell v. City of Griffin, involving one of Jehovah’s witnesses of Atlanta, Georgia, was decided by the nation’s highest tribunal March 28, 1938. The court held that the distribution of books, pamphlets, booklets and papers containing information or opinion of any kind constituted an activity of the press and could not be subjected to license or censorship. The Griffin ordinance was declared invalid on its face. In this case the issue of the right to worship Almighty God without being subjected to license or censorship was likewise raised, but the Supreme Court rejected such contention as not raising a Federal question. This manifests that the high court has a much keener regard for the rights of freedom of the press than for freedom of worship. It also by implication rejects the doctrine set forth in Holy Trinity Church v. United States, that this is a ‘ ‘ Christian nation ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The decision had a powerful effect upon those who have been using the arm of the law to interdict the message of truth. Prosecutors in Plainfield, N. J., La Grange, Ga., and other places, rushed into print claiming that the decision didn’t apply to them. Others, however, recognized the justice of the decision and quit making arrests. Prior to this ruling, a decision in our favor in local police courts, except on technical grounds, was practically unheard of. Now it is a frequent occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the interesting results of the decision is the devious and roundabout efforts made by judges to avoid giving an honest, straightforward decision in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. An illustration in point is a case at Morristown, N. J., before the Court of Co</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font4">on Pleas. The defendant was charged with peddling books without a license. On the trial the defendant freely admitted being in the town, placing literature, and receiving contributions in exchange therefor. The defense was made that the ordinance as applied to such work is invalid under the logic of the Lovell decision. The court did not want to hold the ordinance invalid and couldn’t justly hold the prisoner guilty. So it wiggled out by releasing the defendant because the testimony showed she was on a different street on a different date than alleged in the complaint. This is one of many, many instances which prove the malicious nature of the prosecutions in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another means of avoiding justice by New Jersey courts is to withhold decision when the facts and the law are so plain that the defendant must be discharged. There are at present several cases before Common Pleas judges and before the Supreme Court of New Jersey where the appeals have lain for months. On of them has been before the Supreme Court for almost two years. It would be just too raw to uphold the convictions, so the courts evade the matter and decline to give any decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lovell decision put a serious damper on the persecution in many states. The publishers went back into hostile territory and again spread the good news of the Kingdom to the people in those benighted areas. Finding they could not be held under peddling and handbill ordinances, resort has been made to disorderly conduct statutes. Cases have been worked up and the publishers framed with false charges. In Hoboken, a Fascist city, a publisher, Fred Steinle, was falsely accused by a Catholic woman, prosecuted by a Catholic detective and police, and convicted by a Catholic judge of using abusive language. He was sentenced to ninety days in the Hudson County Penitentiary. Other attempts have been made to frame Jehovah’s witnesses which have not turned out so successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Connecticut New Style of Prosecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coincident' with the rendering of the Lovell decision a number of Papal communities in Connecticut broke out in a rash of prosecutions of a different nature. Laws on the books prohibiting the distribution of abusive, offensive, immoral and obscene literature and literature holding people up to ridicule and contempt on account of their religion were used in a frenzied attempt to choke off the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Riches </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font4"> In the course of a few months 263 publishers were arrested and tried on charges of violating one or more of these statutes. In the police courts the decisions were unanimously against us. Appeals were taken on all cases. In Hartford County the State’s attorney promptly declined to prosecute such cases. In New Haven County a Common Pleas judge held that he would be as “little willing to declare them [the Watch Tower publications] unlawful </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">per se</span><span class="font4"> as I would be to declare that a Christian may not argue the Divinity of Christ, a Jew deny it, and a Confucianist ignore it as a legend”. The opposition in Connecticut now appears to be centralized on two laws, to wit: (1) Inciting to riot. The theory in this is that the literature is so inflammatory and vituperative that people would be immediately incited to smash things up because of its distribution. (2) Soliciting contributions for a charitable and philanthropic organization without a license. Three cases are now on appeal to the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut involving these two charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to defending the cases, an action was brought in the Federal District Court of Connecticut for an injunction to restrain officials of the City of Bristol from enforcing the law prohibiting distribution of offensive literature on the grounds of its invalidity. The District Court upheld the law, and an appeal is now being taken to the United States Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Opposition in the Open</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the striking features of the opposition during this past year has been the forcing of Catholic opposition out into the open. In times past the priests, bishops, and other prelates have kept out of sight and have had the politicians and police do the filthy work while they kept aloof. The burning truths of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and Cure have so scorched them as to cause them to forget caution and expose themselves to all in their overheated desire to suppress all criticism of the unholy church. Priests have thundered from the pulpits; have come out in the open and instigated arrests; have brought pressure to cancel hall and radio contracts; and have committed assaults upon the publishers. All of this is evidence that the truth is burning off the smug hypocrisy of charity and piety worn by the religionists and exposing them to all as racketeers of the worst type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Salute</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have not been many new cases of expulsion of children from school for refusal to salute the flag during the past year. Two eases from New Jersey and Georgia were presented to the United States Supreme Court for decision. The court declined to hear the eases on the ground that there was no Pederal question involved. Some of the courts hold that if a child attends public school it should comply with whatever regulations the school board establishes, and that if it cannot comply with the regulations it should go elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States District Court at Philadelphia decided differently in the case of Gobitis v. Minersville School District et al. Judge Maris decisively and emphatically ruled that no school board or judge has authority to decide for another the validity of his religious convictions, and held a school-board regulation requiring salute to the flag invalid as applied to children who conscientiously object to saluting. The school board has appealed from the decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Nevertheless, as a result of the decision a number of Pennsylvania children were restored to the public schools and two Kingdom schools discontinued. There are seven Kingdom schools still operating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Dake Ronkonkoma, N. Y., two parents were fined on the charge of keeping their child from attendance at the public school. Their daughter had refused to salute the flag because, as she testified before the Court, the saluting of any flag is a violation of the specific law of the Almighty God, whom she worships. She had been sent to school by her parents regularly, and then had as regularly been sent home by the school officials. The parents were held guilty of her detention from school on the grounds that they had taught her not to salute the flag. It raises, therefore, the vital question whether parents can teach children what they believe to be Bible teachings and still keep out of jail. The ease is now pending before the Court of Appeals of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other eases involving the right to attend school without stifling eonseienee to salute a flag are pending on appeal in the Supreme Court of Florida and the Texas Court of Civil Appeals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>“THE WATCHTOWER”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It should be expected that the Lord would have a means of communication to his people on the earth, and he has clearly shown that the magazine called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is used for that purpose. During the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has published in each issue some further enlightenment of Jehovah’s prophecies, which publication has been of great aid and comfort to those who have devoted themselves to the kingdom of God. The subscription list has greatly increased during the year, as it should be expected. The remnant have been constant readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and more recently the “other sheep”, or Jonadabs, have come to clearly see that they need </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> It is therefore strongly urged that all of the Jonadabs avail themselves of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and attend the studies that are held in each company, and that they participate therein that they may more fully see and appreciate their privileges of now serving God and Christ his King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>“CONSOLATION”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> which took the place of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine, has been published and its subscription list has marvelously increased. It is published not only in English, but in five other languages, to wit: German, Hungarian, Polish, Spanish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font5">For the past few years it has been said by some that the work in Great Britain had reached its peak; that there was no more room for additional publishers, and those applying for pioneer service were advised to migrate to other countries. Many of the British brethren did not agree with this conclusion. It did seem strange that anyone should reach that conclusion, because now is the time for Jehovah’s “strange work”, and surely he would not bring his service work to a peak before doing the “strange work”. During the fiscal year just closed the work in Great Britain has taken on a tremendous increase, the distribution of literature almost doubling what it was the previous year. The faithful servants of Jehovah everywhere will read this report with much joy, seeing that it is the best report that has ever come from the British Isles. Please note the comparison of the field activities between 1937 and 1938:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although much more work has been done in the British Branch office during this fiscal year, the number of workers has been reduced, and those who have been released from the office force have taken up the service as field publishers and have done splendid work. This decrease in the office work has been due to the proper organization of the office force. The Lord’s people are learning to make every moment count and to be more efficient, and hence not to waste time or energy. They reason that if efficiency is required in worldly business, with stronger reasoning is it required in the Lord’s organization. The British brethren have more fully awakened to the fact that the present is the great opportunity to bend their energies to advertise the kingdom of Jehovah. Joyfully they have gone forward in the work and great has been their blessings. From the London branch servant’s report the following is taken, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with deep gratitude to Jehovah and his Vindicator King Christ Jesus that we render this report of Kingdom service. Our portion this past year has been one of great joy and prosperity in pushing forward the “strange work” against Jehovah’s enemies. We have been continually strengthened by the rich spiritual food coming to us through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">ever filling us with a keener vision and zeal for the Kingdom. Besides these precious spiritual gifts it has pleased the Lord to bring forth more than a thousand new Jonadab companions to associate with us in arising against the ‘ old lady ’ in battle. Surely the battle is not ours, but God’s. Jehovah be praised for these loving provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of this fiscal year it was pointed out to the British brethren that no substantial increase in Kingdom activity had been made for nearly ten years and that it was time to wake up for a real fight in exposing religious racketeering which curses this land. It was determined to set a quota of one million hours of field service for the year, which would be an increase of 37 percent over last year’s Kingdom work. Every publisher arranged to get down to business and do his share, with the result that now at the end of the year we rejoice to see that the million mark has been exceeded and every branch of the service shows a great increase. Then, at the close of this year, as a special blessing and a climax, it pleased the Lord to grant us the privilege of organizing in ten British cities part of the great world-wide convention of September 9-11 and having Brother Rutherford with us at the key position in London. The brethren throughout the land were thrilled with this great convention. They and the hundreds of newly interested ones coming forward since the “Eace the Facts’’ lecture seem to be charged with the zeal of the Lord to press onward to still greater Kingdom activity pointing out to the inhabitants of this land of tradition and religion that ‘ ‘ RELIGION is A snare and a racket’’. With the new field organization now being put into operation in thirty zones in the British Isles there is every prospect for a far greater witness this coming year. Already the clouds of “state religion” and regimentation are threatening this land in their fear of the monstrosity. As our brethren in other lands, we are ready, by the Lord’s grace, to face the issue and make a bold stand for the King and his kingdom. We will obey Jehovah rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, the general report shows, 338,040 bound books were placed, as well as 3,970,670 booklets, or a total of 4,308,710 pieces of literature. This is an increase of 131,185 bound books and 1,778,229 booklets over last year’s results. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> received the greatest distribution this year. During June we reached our peak number of publishers of 6,021, which is an increase of 1,240 over last year’s highest figure. The average number of publishers for the twelve months was 4,959, to compare with 4,375 of last year. Our field hours were 1,057,817, an increase of 287,857 hours over last year’s report. There was an increase of 75 percent in our sound work, which yielded an attendance of 1,749,146. It will be interesting to note that 538,889 setups were made with the sound instruments, more than half a million of which were made by the phonographs at the homes of the people. The doorstep method with the phonograph has been used very successfully, enabling us to give a far more thorough witness than before. It is hoped to further increase this phase of the service during the coming year. There are now 3,421 phonographs, 283 transcription machines and 93 sound cars regularly in use. The back-call work is coming along very nicely, 86,973 calls having been made during the last nine months of the year. There is a great scope for this work, which will be stressed during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present there are 351 companies organized for service. This is less than last year, but is due to reorganizing of units in various sections of the country. The service organizations and territory of the companies have been thoroughly reorganized during the past year and brought into line with up-to-date methods. Four regional servants were specially trained for this reorganization last winter and sent into the field in March. A good work has been done, and the companies generally now enjoy service arrangements similar to those of the companies in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is room for a great amount of pioneer work in this country. At present 325 are enrolled in this branch of the field service, which is an increase of 142 over last year’s enrollment. There are many more brethren planning to enter the pioneer work shortly, and it is hoped there will be five hundred of these front-line fighters soon. London Company is arranging to operate several pioneer homes throughout the city to enable 50 to 80 of the London company publishers to enter the pioneer service in the greater city. London already has 40 pioneers in the service helping to bring out the ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ ’. This little band of pioneers placed more than one </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font4">on pieces of literature during the year. As a group they averaged 106 hours monthly for the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliary branch of the service was reopened in January. The present enrollment is 169, or an increase over last year’s enrollment by 66. These brethren placed more than 225,000 pieces of literature. It is hoped that many more of the brethren will be able to join this branch of the service. The auxiliaries have been particularly good on the back-call work, having averaged 137 calls during the nine months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the great convention of September 9-11 there were two other general assemblies, one in Manchester, May 28 and 29, and another in Birmingham, July 23 and 24. At these three general assemblies a total of 38,600 attended the public meetings, and 9,116 of which were brethren. The literature placed was 113,124, during 17,969 hours of field service. A total of 455 were immersed. The world-wide convention brought wonderful results in the ten cities, where 1,315 names were turned in for back calls and in addition to 805 having written the London office desiring further information. This made a total of 2,120 newly interested ones. At the first follow-up meeting after “Face the Facts’’ more than a thousand strangers attended these meetings on “Warning’’ and “Violence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Months’ Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was the greatest campaign we have ever had. More than 2,300,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklets were placed with the people, and 98,217 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> books. 6,223 new subscriptions were taken for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine. During these three months we had the greatest influx of new publishers. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet seemed to have freed them from their religious bondage and brought them right out in the service. Nothing like this campaign ever happened before. It was during this campaign that we reached our peak of 6,021 publishers, which was an increase of 1,240 over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little phonograph shop has been erected on the premises here, and we now make our own phonographs. 254 machines have been made during the past three months, although production was interrupted during the busy weeks prior to the convention. This new machine is a direct copy of the new Brooklyn machine. We have been able to make these machines at a reduced rate and pass the saving on to the brethren. We are unable to keep up with the demand for these new machines and are hundreds of orders behind. Prior to June we purchased 651 new machines from outside manufacturers. Thus there was a total of 804 new machines supplied to the brethren for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The family has spent a busy year. Despite increased activity at the Branch office, their field activity was greatly increased. 2,622 bound books and 20,981 booklets were placed this year, to compare with 1,567 books and 11,811 booklets of last year. 5,554 hours for 1938, an increase of 709, even though having fewer publishers. They made 235 back calls and 6,761 phonograph setups, with a sound attendance of 14,312. Eight of the boys serve as unit servants for the greater London company, and four others as regional servants for the new organization. A new Dodge station wagon has been purchased by Brother Rutherford for the general use in the shipping end of the work and also for field service on week-ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">London Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greater London company, which now has more than 1,000 company field publishers, has been divided into nine units. The general headquarters is maintained at Kingdom Hall (formerly known as the Tabernacle). During the year the company doubled its placement of bound books and booklets in the greater city. During this year these publishers placed 593,413 pieces of literature, to compare with 266,564 of last year. Their field time increased from 93,305 hours in 1937 to 137,803 for 1938. The sound work also increased from 162,675 attendance to 277,123 for 1938. During recent months additional Kingdom halls have been arranged for, so that there are now six </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom halls in addition to the one at Craven Terrace to serve the increasing numbers in the various large sections of the city. Pioneers homes are now being arranged for to house about 80 more pioneers to aid in giving this city a more thorough witness and to feed the “great multitude”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year Jehovah’s witnesses of South Africa have manifested the zeal peculiar to the house of the Lord. The territory looked after from the Cape Town office embraces South, Central and East Africa. The territory is great in size and thinly populated, and this retards in a large degree the work of spreading the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Fascist-Catholic combine with much strength opposes the work in that land and continues to show venom against Jehovah’s kingdom. Such opposition has not in the least dampened the zeal of the true followers of Christ in South Africa, and so the work in that land has progressed during the year, as it should be expected. There has been a decided increase in the amount of literature placed in the hands of the people during the year, and this will be observed from extracts taken from the report of the local branch servant, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has richly blessed his “strange work’’ in the above territories during the past twelve months. The figures reflect a big increase over the result for the previous year. For this we render our praise and thanksgiving to Jehovah. Organization instructions have been faithfully carried out, and there has been greater unity in action than ever before. We rejoice in the clear evidence that Jehovah’s theocratic government is in operation with Christ Jesus leading and directing our activities. During the past twelve months the branch office at Cape Town distributed 100,430 bound volumes and 433,513 booklets, or a total of 533,943 pieces of literature. There has therefore been an increase of 29,716 volumes and 70,066 booklets over last year’s distribution. These publications were in 30 different languages. Of the total distributed 70 percent were in European languages and the remainder in Bantu and Asiatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main part of the work is carried forward in the Union of South Africa. During the year there has been a monthly average of 30 pioneers, 3 auxiliaries and 345 company publishers, to compare with 24, 5 and 312 last year. Our peak figure of publishers was reached during the April campaign, when there were 482 in action. As the total number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in the Union is just over 500, it will be seen that practically all had some part in the work. The pioneers have averaged 114 hours per month; the auxiliaries, 66; and the company and isolated publishers, 13. Regular reports are received from 80 different centers in the Union; an increase of 10 during the past year. An increase in the number of publishers means an increase of time spent in the witness work, and the total hours of field service were 95,392; an increase of 11,809.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work with sound machines has taken on fresh impetus. The witness by means of the sound ears and transcription machines has been maintained, and many more are now making use of the phonograph; and this has increased the effectiveness of the witness given. Phonographs sent out from the office during the year numbered 100, bringing the total distributed to 320. Of these, approximately 200 are in regular use in the Union. In addition there are 10 sound cars and 10 transcription machines sounding, forth the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message. At the begin</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font4">g of 1938 you kindly furnished us with recording apparatus, and we are now able to make recordings of your phonograph lectures translated in various African languages, such as Cinyanja, Sesuto, Xosa, and Zulu. These are opening up a new field and will greatly increase the witness work amongst the African peoples. We and they are appreciative of the provision made! The total of discs sent out during the year in English, Afrikaans and the various African languages numbered 1,475 (2,950 records). Total speech dises distributed is now 5,318 (10,636 records), and Song discs, 711.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The special campaign periods were again greatly blessed of the Lord and resulted in a wide witness’ being given. The peak was reached during the three-month campaign, when we had more publishers in action than ever before, a 15-percent increase over the previous peak figure. The brethren were glad to have the special offer with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> to introduce to the people. We surpassed our quota and obtained three times as many new subscriptions as during the whole of the previous service year. The total of new subscribers in the three months is 1,400. The complete report was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three-month campaign—April to June 1938, Union of South Africa: books, 19,147; booklets, 101,191; publishers, 482; hours, 27,698; obtainers, 85,681; attendance, 67,546; back calls, 1,857; new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, 1,400.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Report for six 9-day periods (1937-1938): Books, 20,118; booklets, 106,160; publishers, 458; hours, 28,085; obtainers, 78,138; attendance, 69,546; back calls, 848.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Call Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The introduction, in December, of the back-call work has been one of the special features of the work during the past year. A few had some difficulty in grasping the importance and necessity for this phase of Kingdom activity, but it is a pleasure to report a steady increase since the work began, and we hope shortly to be averaging at least one back call per company publisher per week. Distances in this country are great, but much zeal is being manifested by the publishers in calling on those who have already shown some interest in the Kingdom message, and we are doing all we can to help them find their way to Zion. The records and new Model Study method have been of great assistance to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conventions and service assemblies were held at Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban. These were seasons of great joy for the assembled publishers. Nowadays all who assemble come with the desire to honor Jehovah’s name by sharing in the Kingdom work. The recorded lecture entitled “Safety” was used, and the advertising in connection therewith resulted in a wide witness’ being given. Discussion of up-to-date </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles and instruction on latest organization methods equipped us to render more efficient service in the field. Back-call demonstrations and model studies with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and campaign booklets were a special feature at these assemblies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As reported at the end of last year, the decision of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia in the Sedition ease was that the banned publications were not seditious and an order was given that the seized books be released. The Bulawayo magistrate on behalf of the government appealed against this decision, and the ease was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. The South African judges upheld the decision of the Rhodesian judge, and the appeal was dismissed with costs. All of the Society’s publications are therefore free to circulate in Southern Rhodesia. It was &quot;certain religious bodies” in Southern Rhodesia who induced the politicians to introduce the Sedition Bill, and with the specific object of suppressing the Society’s literature. Hence this effort to suppress the truth has completely failed, and a wider witness has been given to the Kingdom message in Southern Rhodesia than we could possibly have hoped otherwise to give. During th'e past year there has been a monthly average of 321 publishers in the field, who have distributed 2,699 bound books and 12,894 booklets, with 15,124 obtainers. Twenty phonographs are now in use, and the sound attendance numbered 25,299. There are 34 company organizations. Baek calls numbered 582. In addition to the work performed by the brethren resident in Southern Rhodesia two European pioneers from the Union served the European population, and a splendid witness was given by them during the five months they were in the country. The complete report is given herewith. One of the African company servants was sentenced by a magistrate to a £10 fine or two months’ imprisonment on a charge of ‘‘trading without a general dealer’s license”. The case, however, was reviewed by the High Court, and the conviction and sentence were quashed. The result of the Sedition trial has been a great encouragement to all who love God and who desire to see his kingdom of righteousness established. The publishers are in better spirit than at any time in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Northern Rhodesia continues to go forward in the face of many difficulties. However, the publishers have the joy of the Lord in their hearts and the work of instruction goes on apace. Regional servants are first trained at the depot and then sent out to the various companies, and the work in each district is being organized in harmony with organization instructions. As a result the publishers are being better equipped and carry forward the work more intelligently and orderly than formerly. During the year there has been a monthly average of 939 publishers, who placed 366 volumes and 18,471 booklets, with 17,033 obtainers. There are some 20 phonographs in regular use, and when a greater number of records in Cinyanja are available more effective back-call work will be possible. The total sound attendance was 22,923, and 794 back calls were made on interested people. The total time spent in field service was 202,737 hours, giving a monthly average of 17 hours per publisher. The brother in the depot reports in part as follows: &quot;There has been a healthy increase in the work during the past year. The religious organizations, with their powerful grip on the natives through the different missions, are feeling keenly the effect' of the Kingdom message, and as soon as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government—Siding the Truth: Why?</span><span class="font4"> appeared in Chiwemba, the language of an African people almost completely dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, it was banned, an apparent evidence of the powerful influence of the Roman Catholic church upon the government. Violence is resorted to against a few of Jehovah’s witnesses in their work, and this, as we might expect, is limited almost exclusively to Roman Catholics, but, on the whole, this has decreased owing to the punishment inflicted by officials upon the offenders. The prevailing lack of knowledge and of ability to read with understanding makes general progress slow, and our few available regionals have to stay with a new company at least two months before anything like organization can be effected. The desire to be a &quot;chief” in the Lord’s organization dies hard, and so, too, in some cases, the disposition to take instruction through the Lord’s channel with hesitation; but those who have the spirit of Christ soon appreciate the benefits of obedience to organization instructions and with zeal and unity are showing devotion to the Lord in a service which demands courage and faith to overcome the many difficulties met with in witnessing in a &quot;wild, dry and dangerous country”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are 48 company organizations in Nyasaland. Two regionals have been kept busy throughout the year, and their efforts to help the brethren have resulted in more effective organization. There are 1,444 brethren holding identification cards, and the monthly average of publishers was 1,065. The work in Nyasaland is in good shape. The brother in the depot at Zomba reports in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The arrival of the Cinyanja records and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> in the same language have been the crowning events of the year. Voted by all who read it as the opening chapter to a new and advanced outlook upon the Lord’s purposes, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> is going out to the hungry in a steady stream and the distribution thereof has brought up the bound-book placements considerably. For the most part of the year we have had only the English records to carry on with, and this has restricted the work to some extent. But now that the Cinyanja talks have been prepared, results will be far brighter. Reports to hand indicate that there is plenty of work ahead for all and brethren are responding to meet their obligations. The wherewithal to purchase the phonographs is somewhat of a problem, but the matter is receiving attention and slowly, but surely, the brethren are collecting to equip themselves first with ‘company’ machines and then later with the records. Some companies are arranging fishing parties to Lake Nyasa to carry loads of fish from there to the markets down this way, the proceeds to go to the ‘phonograph’ fund. The brethren are very grateful to the Society for making it possible for them to handle the Kingdom message with the aid of the recorded talks in their own language. The brethren in the 48 companies have worked hard and have encountered many difficulties in getting the message into the hands of the people. Never before has there been such unity. North, south, east and west the bond of truth and love for the Lord and his kingdom grows with time, and the Nyasaland division is glad to present to the people that mark of unity and fellowship as an emblem of their determination to prove their integrity and allegiance to the Most High.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The figures for the year are in excess of those of the past year. Bound volumes distributed totaled 3,803; booklets, 19,222. The obtainers numbered 22,597. There are some 24 phonographs in regular use. The sound attendance was 12,787. The total time spent in the field was 189,347 hours; back calls, 171. The complete report and comparison with last year is attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The few brethren working in Portuguese East Africa continue to do what they can to spread the good news of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom. There has been a monthly average of 14 publishers, who have worked 2,836 hours, placed 104 volumes and 1,660 booklets, with 1,501 obtainers. There are 4 phonographs in use. The sound attendance was 347, and back calls numbered 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren working on this lonely isle of the sea have kept the banner of truth flying high. One brother who owns a cafe entertains his customers with the speech and music records and has placed quite a fair bit of literature in that way. There are two phonographs in regular use, and many of the islanders have been enlightened concerning Jehovah’s purpose. There is considerable opposition from the religionists, but the brethren permit nothing to discourage them or to prevent their having a regular part in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” and “Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It gives pleasure to report a very considerable increase on the files during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in the office continues to increase. Letters received numbered 8,051, an increase of 638 over last year. Letters dispatched numbered 8,792, and circulars, 7,828; a total outgoing mail of 16,620. The brethren working here continue to appreciate the privilege of service and rejoice to be having a share in the battle. The week-ends, public holidays and at least one evening each week are devoted to field service. During the past year the five publishers in the office averaged 21 hours each per month, placed 2,095 bound books and 6,010 booklets, with 4,651 obtainers. Sound attendance with sound car and phonographs was 9,903; back calls, 80; and new subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> 84. The dispatch desk sent out 2,874 cartons, 2,387 book packets, and 5,897 single copies of the journals. The branch servant had the privilege of attending the worldwide convention at London. Many telegrams and letters were received at the office. These came from the publishers throughout Southern Africa commissioning him to convey their warm love and good wishes to you. They are unanimous in their desire to have a personal visit from you, and should it be possible for you to spare the time, a warm welcome awaits you. The brethren in this part of the field are wholeheartedly with you in the fight now in progress and are determined by the Lord’s grace to maintain their integrity and to be in it right to the end. We recognize that we are under the direction of the Lord and are ready to follow wherever he may lead. We</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">look forward to the early humiliation and destruction of the “old woman” and the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The only reason for reference to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization is that it may be seen that the same wicked Inquisition methods employed by that religious organization centuries ago are still in vogue. The Devil continues his time-old tactics of opposing God and his kingdom. This proves beyond all doubt that the Hierarchy, Satan’s chief instrument in the earth, employs its subtlety to overreach the people and turn them against the kingdom of God by keeping them in ignorance of his gracious provisions. The Devil’s determination to turn all men against the Lord’s kingdom is ever manifested in his continuous effort to hold the people of Africa in the dark. In every country where the Catholic Hierarchy has some strong forces opposition to the truth is shown. The evidence is so clear that the opposition proceeds from the Devil, and through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as his chief representative on earth, that the Lord’s children are fired with greater zeal to push on with the work. The Society’s branch servant at Lagos, Nigeria, reports to this office, and the following is copied from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank the Lord for his loving-kindness towards us amidst bitter opposition from the agents of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, the “evil servant” class, and other parts of the Devil’s organization. In spite of the attacks the work has prospered. We give God the glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witnesses of Jehovah are forbidden by the authorities in the French territories between Nigeria and the Gold Coast to circulate the publications of the Watch Tower Society. Many of them were beaten, arrested, and thrown into jail for so doing. After their release they were escorted to the boundary by the police. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting to know that the branch servant who went from here to the Gold Coast by steamer two years ago, but was not permitted to land, made the trip last April by land with the sound car. On his arrival at Accra he presented himself at the Immigration Office with passport, but was told pointedly that as a prohibited immigrant he was liable to be arrested. After a long discussion he was given six days to remain in the colony under police supervision. Said privilege was reversed two hours later. He was informed by the Immigration officer and chief of police who came in search of him to quit the country in three hours ’ time. At the appointed time a police escorted him to the French boundary; from there he proceeded back to Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In going through the French territories his car was searched, in order to find out if there was any literature belonging to the Watch Tower Society. You would be glad to know that in spite of the preventive measures from the enemy the publishers succeeded in placing many French books and booklets, amongst the oppressed natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is gratifying to see the Jonadabs coming forward after hearing the call; and they in turn inviting others, with the phonograph records of Judge Rutherford’s lectures, and with the books and booklets.—Rev. 22: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Yoruba brethren were overjoyed when the branch servant informed them that Brother Rutherford has approved of a brother going from here to Berne, Switzerland, to do the recording of the Yoruba records. The passage money for the trip was quickly collected. The records in Yoruba will be of great help to the Yoruba population, especially to those that cannot understand the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present crisis in Europe has also added more zeal to the publishers in assisting the “great multitude” coming out of the increasing tribulation on the Devil’s world.—Rev. 7: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past six years in Nigeria four books and sixteen booklets have been translated in Yoruba, two in Itsekiri, two in Hausa, three in Ibo, one in Efik, also on the Gold Coast one in Twi, and one in Ga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As members of Jehovah’s theocratic government with courage and confidence we step into another year, and by his grace and strength we hope to continue valiantly in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office at Buenos Aires looks after the witness work in the Argentine Republic, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile. Although that part of the country is rich in natural resources, there is great poverty amongst the people and much suffering amongst those especially who are poor. The cost of living continues to mount higher, and the oppression of the people increases. The clergy and political officials join their efforts together to keep the peo-pie in subjection and in ignorance of God’s purposes. The Society’s local servant at Buenos Aires reports that Catholic Action grows in vicious opposition and during the year has greatly increased. While it is true the Constitution of the Argentine Republic gives guarantee of freedom of worship, yet the publie officials under the dominating influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ignore this legal guarantee and continue to persecute and punish Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in that land. As in other places, they cause the arrest of the publishers of the Kingdom and, when arrested, attempt to prevent them from having any legal assistance. These brethren, however, rely upon the Lord and continue to push the work and have done well under the adverse circumstances during the year in carrying on the work in that land. The publishers are few in number, but their zeal is shown by the results. In Argentina they have placed 131,148 books and booklets, have worked 44,712 hours, and 82,993 persons have been informed of God’s graeious provision by receiving the Kingdom message in printed form. In Paraguay the placement of books and booklets has been, to wit, 3,121. In Uruguay the placements were 6,708; in Chile, 18,054. In all these countries here mentioned there is a great amount of unemployment and the people have difficulty in providing the things necessary to live. Many of them who hear the Kingdom message express their sincere desire that soon the Lord may relieve them, and it is gratifying to know that their desire shall be realized.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office at Sydney, Australia, gives attention to the Kingdom service work throughout Australia and New Zealand, Tasmania, Malaya, Hong Kong, Siam, East Indies, Tonga, Burma, French Indo-China, Fiji, New Guinea, and also scattered islands in the South Pacific. Satan is a past master at politics, but he follows the same rule in almost every instance, to first work on the weaker sections of the outlying territory and then bring all of his forces into the center. The countries above mentioned are a part of the British Empire, the headquarters of which, of course, are at London. As will be observed from this report, the crown colonies and other divisions of the empire are especially infested with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, Satan’s chief agents, who put forth their most effective work first in the weaker outlying colonies or countries. For instance, in the Fiji Islands the Hierarchy has been able to almost destroy the witness work by preventing the importation of any literature that the natives in that island might receive the truth. This is a sample of what is being done in the other countries in and about Australia. While the Hierarchy is exceedingly strong, particularly from the government officials’ viewpoint, there are many earnest and sincere persons throughout the land who resent the efforts put forth by the Hierarchy to prevent the people from hearing the truth or from assembling and having a free and open discussion of the truth. The people are being divided, the larger number, of course, adhering to Satan’s side while the lesser and noble-hearted number are fleeing from Satan’s organization and finding refuge in the Lord. The fight in Australia and outlying territory against entrenched wickedness has been severe during the year and Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and their companions have done a more noble service, and doubtless more effective, than any time in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the territory above described there has been an increase of the field workers during the year and the number of hours put in the service has greatly increased. The placement of books in the hands of the people during the year has aggregated 919,244. It is gratifying to note, however, that there has been a tremendous witness in many languages amongst many classes of people, and thus the Lord is fulfilling his prophecy to cause the witness to be given throughout the nations. The Society’s other publications have given a more extended report of some branches of the work than is here allotted, but this report will give a summary of what has been done within the Australian jurisdiction during the fiscal year just ended. There has been an increase in the number of pioneers that have entered the field during the year; also an increase in the number of company workers. The message has been broadcast by radio and by other means. The Society’s branch servant at Sydney, Australia, in his annual report for this office, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Report for Australasian Branch, Year 1937-1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visit of Brother Rutherford has made the year just closed the most momentous in the history of God’s people in Australasia. Such a mighty witness was given on that occasion to the name and word of Almighty God that it has resulted in a complete change in the work. As far as the truth is concerned, a definite crisis was there precipitated and the people have been obliged to take their stand either on one side or on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a direct outcome of that visit and events incident thereto, hundreds of persons of good will, now discerning the hypocrisy of religion, have taken their stand for God’s kingdom. On the other hand, many have chosen to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three months before Brother Rutherford arrived in Australia, an extensive advertising campaign was inaugurated to notify the nation of his personal visit and of the public lecture “Warning”. Upward of 2,000,000 leaflets were printed and shipped from Strathfield to every publisher and interested person throughout Australia and New Zealand. Car signs, window cards, electric signs and posters were placed in prominent positions everywhere. One evening just before the lecture, carloads of brothers armed with placards and hammers nailed up signs on trees along miles of highways leading to Sydney. Sound cars combed and recombed the city making microphone announcements, and radio stations were used to tell thousands more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arrangements were made by the Society to broadcast the speech by radio to all parts of the Commonwealth, and many stations were lined up in readiness. The religionists, however, arranged with the Postmaster-General’s Department to censor the speech before allowing it to be broadcast. To submit God’s word to any man for such a purpose would be entirely out of harmony with the Scriptures, and therefore the lecture was not broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to acquaint the officials with the fact that they were going contrary to the wishes of the public, a petition was drawn up and circulated throughout the Commonwealth. Forms were rushed by air to every center, and in ten days they were back at Strathfield, signed by 120,000 persons. That petition was ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Weather conditions for the open-air public lecture could not have been more pleasant. Crowds of people flocked to the Sports Ground from all directions in cars, trams and buses. At four o’clock, when Brother Rutherford stood before the microphone, 25,000 persons welcomed him with loud and prolonged acclamation and at intervals throughout the lecture indicated their appreciation of the fearless statements condemning religion and the monstrosity which it has set up on the earth. To be sure, the Hierarchy had its representatives there to cause a disturbance, but their efforts were without avail, and they merely succeeded in making themselves unpopular with the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A contract to print the speech in a well-known morning newspaper had been signed some weeks previously. Immediately after the speech was delivered on Sunday afternoon the copy was sent to the newspaper office, but they had decided that the speech might shock the religious susceptibilities of some of their readers, and therefore refused to publish it. Brother Rutherford then made arrangements to print the speech in booklet form and to include in it, besides the text of the address, some interesting facts relative to the events above mentioned. The title of the booklet is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom or Romanism?</span><span class="font4"> and it has already been distributed by the thousands throughout Australia and New Zealand. “Warning” was also recorded, so that persons who were deprived of the opportunity of hearing it by radio may now listen to it in their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During Brother Rutherford’s visit a convention was held in Sydney and was attended by Kingdom publishers from every corner of our territory, Malaya, Java, French Indo-China, Shanghai, New Zealand, and all states of the Commonwealth, everyone eager to meet Brother Rutherford, hear his addresses and participate in the advertising campaign. They enjoyed every minute of the convention and took back with them to their local territory a keen determination to press forward in the work as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Year's Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Briefly stated, the report for the year 1937-1938 shows a substantial increase in the number of publishers participating in service, but a decrease in the hours devoted to witnessing and in the amount of literature placed with the people. This is no doubt due to the fact that three whole months, February, March and April, were used almost exclusively for advertising Brother Rutherford’s public address, “Warning.” The actual number of books and booklets placed during the year is 919,244, and of magazines distributed in field service, 169,002; a total of 1,088,246.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has brought to our attention more clearly than ever the responsibility now resting on both the anointed and their companions. To locate the “other sheep” and then actively share in the proclamation of the Kingdom message is seen to be the Lord’s requirement of all those who would have his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The intensity of the fight calls for more and more full-time publishers. Back calls have definitely become an integral part of the witness work, and consequently the need for pioneers is now more apparent than ever. They being able to devote their whole time to it, their work of locating and assisting the ‘ ‘ other sheep” by personally keeping in contact with them has proved most effective, as results testify. Small companies are springing up throughout the territory. In towns where heretofore there have been no publishers, there are now representatives of God’s kingdom who are active and zealous in the work committed them and, in turn, they are busy searching for those of the <sup>1</sup> ‘ other sheep ’ ’ class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The territory under the control of this ofiice is a vast one, embracing, as it does, the countries of Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Netherlands East Indies, Burma, Siam, French IndoChina, Hong Kong, New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, and a myriad of islands scattered throughout the South Pacific. Many of these latter it is practical to witness to only by mailing booklets to the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many companies now operating in the larger towns in most of the above-named countries, but the bulk of the work is done by pioneers. With the zeal which is peculiar to the Lord’s house these brethren have faithfully carried the banner of God’s kingdom to places where the truth has never been before and amongst people who cannot understand a word of their speech. The blessings showered upon them by Jehovah, however, more than compensate any hardships which the pioneers may endure for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound cars and transcription machines have played a definite part in the work of locating the Jonadabs and have been used extensively during the year. The Roman Catholic-Fascist combine do not like to have their refuge of lies bombarded by such long-range and such effective weapons, and therefore they vigorously oppose their use. Consequently, many of the town councils have announced they will not permit our equipment either on the streets or on private property and will enforce the ordinances by using certain clauses of the Local Government Act. But so far our sound work has not been seriously hampered. Machines are in operation in practically every country, the actual number being 34 sound-car units and 107 transcription machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phonographs are used consistently in the house-to-house and back-call work. Almost all publishers are now equipped with a machine and records, with the result that the presentation of the message is uniform everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phonograph club has been organized in each company so that everyone, irrespective of his financial position, can now have a phonograph and discs. The club is proving to be of great benefit in this direction and is certainly making for 100-percent efficiency. There were 1,582 phonographs in use during the year, to compare with 825 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of persons who heard the Kingdom message by means of lectures played on sound machines and phonographs is 604,218; an increase of 23,109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most outstanding of the testimony periods was, undoubtedly, the three months’ campaign with the special offer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Cure</span><span class="font4"> and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscription for the usual rate of the latter. This campaign had particular significance for God’s people in Australia because it marked the time of Brother Rutherford’s visit. Of necessity the advertising campaign in preparation for the great witness there given occupied much of the publishers’ time; nevertheless, a vigorous effort was made to take care of our share of the world-wide witness, and the Lord’s blessing was manifest upon it. Books were placed to the number of 27,703; booklets, 254,391; and 2,742 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the six nine-day testimony periods 262,179 pieces of literature were placed with the people in 109,835 hours of field service. The highest number of publishers reporting for any one campaign was 1,320.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">News that henceforth testimony periods will be one month in duration has just reached us, and we are thankful to our heavenly Father for this provision which will mean an added impetus for the work and make it possible to cover much more territory on these special occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the Society’s policy regarding radio, as outlined in the lecture “Worshiping God’’, we have reduced the number of stations broadcasting the Kingdom message to eight. All of these are presenting the programs just as arranged by the Society and are not attempting to blue-pencil them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Postmaster-General’s Department is most inconsistent in its methods of censorship. They absolutely refused to grant land-lines to stations for both the “Warning” and “Face the Facts” lectures, and yet the facilities of the Government’s National Network are freely placed at the disposal of such men as Von Luckner, a Nazi. Just recently the translation of a speech by Hitler was relayed from overseas by the National Network. The authorities contended, and rightly so, that the people are quite able to reject such of the matter with which they are not in agreement. It is interesting to note, though, how the tune is changed when the truth is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A small army of publishers maintain the work in the various islands of our territory. The variety of languages constitutes a considerable problem, but publications in the vernaculars are now being printed and it is hoped that this difficulty will soon be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year it was found necessary to transfer the Singapore office to larger and more central premises in order to cope with the volume of work for the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in 1938 the territory of Burma was placed under the jurisdiction of the Australasian office. Since that time three pioneers and twenty-five company publishers have been actively engaged in the Kingdom work there and have placed during the last five months of the year a total of 3,647 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The population of this country is made up of many different nationalities, which makes it necessary to have publications in a variety of languages in order to carry on the work. The general mass of the people are steeped in superstition and ignorance, as is the case with most of the countries of the Far East, and it is possible only to witness to those who have had some education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure, the emissaries of the Devil are on the job in Burma as elsewhere and they have done their utmost to malign the truth by circulating vicious lies about Jehovah’s witnesses. A recent report shows that the Hierarchy’s representatives are feeling the heat of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom or Romanism?</span><span class="font4"> and bitterly opposing its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">French Indo-Chlna</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two pioneers have spent several months in French IndoChina, working 895 hours and placing 5,582 books and booklets. Most of this work has been done in the cities of Saigon, Hanoi and Haiphong amongst the French and English-speaking population. A booklet is now being prepared in Annamese, the native language of the country, and it is expected that when it is ready the Kingdom message will be proclaimed to a far greater extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been no active opposition to our work, but the brethren have been hindered by certain laws which prohibit them from witnessing in the French Protectorates. Permission to enter one of these has now been obtained, and one of the pioneers will go there early in the new year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year three pioneers spent the equivalent of about two months in Hong Kong and during that time gave a good witness in spite of adverse conditions as a result of the Hierarchy’s war in China. Two company publishers have also been active. Total literature placed on the island amounts to 3,616 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the Malayan peninsula, three pioneers, three auxiliaries and seven company publishers have been pushing the work with all their might. The 7,033 hours they have devoted to Kingdom service have resulted in the placement of 44,157 books and booklets in various languages. The enemy has been particularly active here. In Seremban two pioneers were attacked by a mob, organized by a Catholic priest, who also caused the publication of a leaflet containing the usual malicious slander and misrepresentations. In Malacca a Portuguese Catholic religionist attempted to break up a peaceful transcription meeting conducted in the open by threatening our pioneers with a gun, demanding that the lectures be stopped. His threats, however, were not heeded and the lecture continued, much to the delight of the attentive audience. The chief police officer, to whom the religionists made complaints, took sides with them and uttered unwarranted threats against our pioneers, ordering them to leave town. A letter reminding him of his place was sent from our Singapore office, and it appears that he is now somewhat subdued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greater part of Malaya was covered last year, but there is plenty of room for more pioneers. Jonadabs are coming forward to take up the work, and it is expected that in the year ahead a great increase will be noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Netherlands East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this group of islands are included Java, Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes, besides numerous smaller ones. Seven years ago the truth was first taken to Java by a lone pioneer, who is still doing real pioneer work in the East. Today there are eleven pioneers and twelve company publishers busy in the service. Last year, as a result of their combined efforts, 37,010 books and booklets were distributed, mostly in the Dutch and Malay languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the increase in interest there has come increased opposition. Under pressure from religionists, without a doubt, the authorities have banned some of our publications and are keeping a close watch on our work. A pioneer working in Sumatra was arrested, his books confiscated and his work temporarily stopped, but in spite of such opposition he is now continuing to give faithful testimony and his reports show that the Lord is richly blessing his activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Slam</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year a pioneer worked in this country for about four months. He visited many of the towns and villages in the northern districts and was able to place with the people there 2,491 books and booklets. This brother has experienced many hardships in his work, but these he has joyfully endured as a faithful follower of Christ Jesus, and his efforts have been richly blessed by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As is the case in French Indo-China, the difficulty in Siam is the absence of publications in the native tongue. It is expected that this will be overcome with the production of a Siamese booklet early this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Fiji the Society's publications and phonograph recordings have been banned, but the work has not stopped by any means. On the contrary, many persons are coining to a knowledge of the truth as a result of the efforts of the brethren there. A sound car has been used extensively both in Suva and in the various native villages throughout the island. As there are no recordings of the lectures in Fijian, one of the brethren reads translations of same over the microphone, and in this way an effective witness is given. A considerable number of books and booklets have been placed in conjunction with these lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tonga</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Vavau, an island of the Tongan group, there is an ambassador of the Lord who is doing much good work. During the year he distributed 1,012 books and booklets amongst the people of that country and has found many persons of good will towards the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As is the case in Australia, the Hierarchy is secretly placing its men in all key positions in the New Zealand government departments, with the ultimate object of &quot;white-anting” the structure and gaining complete control of the country. In. a measure they have already succeeded, and as Armageddon draws near there is no doubt they will continue so to do until the Lord’s due time to stop them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Monday, May 2, Brother Rutherford addressed an enthusiastic and appreciative audience of 4,000 persons in the Auckland Town Hall. Brethren from all parts of the Dominion were present and in the few days beforehand had participated in an intensive advertising campaign as was conducted in Australia a short time previously. Additionally, news of events in Sydney were published in New Zealand papers and therefore the people were well informed of the visit and lecture of Brother Rutherford. The religionists were on the job, of course, and did their utmost to hinder the arrangements. They were successful only in preventing the broadcast, and this has since been counteracted by taking the recordings of the speech to the homes of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year has shown a decided increase in the number of phonographs in use in house-to-house witnessing, and, combining this modern method with back calls, a very efficient work has been done. As is to be expected, the Devil has done all possible to stop the sound cars’ being operated and definite objections have been raised in Auckland, Hawera and Christchurch by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to the lack of transport, much of the territory in New Zealand is covered less than once each year, while other portions in the closely settled districts are covered every few weeks. The general report is that the publications are going out now better than ever before. During campaigns, if a decrease is shown, such decrease can invariably be traced to a shortage of hours. City territory that has been repeatedly done is just as respondent now as five or six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For many years the brethren in this part of the world have desired to have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> printed in Australia, so as to give it local color and also that they may receive it more promptly. When in Sydney, Brother Rutherford readily approved of this proposal to advance the Kingdom interests in this way and personally made the preliminary arrangements. Brethren throughout Australia and New Zealand have given their ready support to the enterprise, with the result that necessary machinery has now been obtained. It is expected that the first issue of the Australian edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> will be off the press before the close of 1938. This will give a tremendous impetus to the work and provide an excellent means of exposing the machinations of the Hierarchy’s representatives in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are confident that the Lord will bestow his rich blessing on the magazine and prosper it in his service. A quota of 50,000 copies of each issue is our goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Boats</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Lightbearer”, which has been operating in Far Eastern waters for three years, has returned to Sydney for an overhaul and general repairs. During the early part of the year tile yacht traveled along the coast of Celebes and Borneo, but, owing to the fact that most of the ports were closed to all shipping other than one line monopolized by the government., the pioneers had some difficulty in carrying on their work. Their report is included in that shown for the Netherlands Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two smaller boats are used on the rivers, one in Brisbane and the other in Sydney. Both of these are now being fitted with powerful sound equipment so that the lectures may be broadcast to crowds on beaches and in parks. This work is yet in its infancy, but it is hoped that it will be developed during the present service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Complete harmony and a uniform desire to advance the Kingdom interests exist among all members of the family at Strathfield. For them the year just closed has been one of unprecedented activity in the Lord’s service, and joyfully they have performed their part. Each one has actively engaged in. field service, the combined efforts of the family resulting in the placement of 8,829 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opportunity of meeting and working with you whilst in Sydney, Brother Rutherford, was keenly appreciated by the family, and that season of fellowship has been most refreshing and stimulating to each one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our determination is to present a solid front to the enemy and, with the strength and grace provided by the Lord, to fight with you to the victorious end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Brazil, South America, have long been kept in darkness by the religionists. The country is overwhelmingly Catholic, and it is only to be expected that the people are ignorant wherever the Hierarchy operates. The facts in Brazil prove this clearly and forcefully. The Lord has seen to it, however, that the people of that land shall have an opportunity to know that his kingdom is their only means of salvation and relief. The Lord’s work is young in that country, and only comparatively few persons engage therein, but during the fiscal year just ended the work has gone forward with a splendid increase. Books and booklets placed in the hands of the people total 102,638. The small army of publishers has worked 31,153 hours and has placed literature in the hands of 74,603 people. Those attending the sound ear meetings, wherein the truth is reproduced by electrical transcription, number 220,137. Twenty-eight phonographs in addition to the sound machine have been in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bound books in the languages used, chiefly in the Portuguese, are not numerous. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font5"> are the chief bound books used, and therefore the booklets are more readily placed in the hands of the people. During the year the booklet output increased 33 percent and the total literature placed in the hands of the people increased 30 percent. The publishers in Brazil are poor in this world’s goods. Most of them live on farms, and when they find it difficult to go back and forth because of the bad means of travel they meet with their neighbors and with the use of the phonograph advertise the King and the Kingdom, greatly to the joy of the people who participate. The small number of publishers in that country make up much by the increased zeal. Having long been in darkness, and having their eyes illuminated by the gracious things of Jehovah, they rejoice in passing this good news on to others. The local servant in his report to this office, amongst other things, says the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Year’s Battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year opened with the refreshing report of the Columbus convention, and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> made us eager for the combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November the president of the then Republic of Brazil seized control of the government, making this another totalitarian state, and immediately the agents of the Hierarchy, no doubt feeling their power, began an active persecution against the Kingdom publishers. The attack was concentrated along two lines especially: the pioneers and the sound car. The pioneers, witnessing alone, were hounded by small-town officials, accused of Communism, treated with all manner of indignities, ordered out of the community. Sometimes the brethren were haled before the authorities who, in most cases, had more sense than their subordinates and, after examining their literature, released them. This persecution has caused some to withdraw from the ranks, but others have later come forward to take their places, so that the year closes with more in the front ranks. Eight of these enrolled since the three months’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conso-lation-Cwe-Eiches</span><span class="font4"> campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other center of attack was the sound car. There is but one sound car in the Lord’s service in Brazil, and that one is known to millions of people, “o carro-sonante da Watch Tower.” Agents of the Devil have tried in every possible way to stop it, and every effort made to stop it the Lord has used as a means of further advertising the Kingdom. One Sunday afternoon in November, a city official seized the sound car while giving a program at a city park in Sao Paulo. At the police station the sound car was released, also the party, but warned not to give any more programs until the Prefeito (mayor) had given his approval No attention was paid to this warning other than starting legal proceedings and a publicity campaign to expose this agent of the Hierarchy responsible for interfering with the Kingdom message. Every Sunday during the year, rain or shine, the sound ear gave programs in Sao Paulo and the suburban towns. Failing after three months’ effort to secure favorable consideration by any of the city departments, report of the matter was made first to the State authorities, including the governor, and then to the national government, including President Vargas. The ambassador and consul general of the United States were notified of the interference with the Kingdom work. Early in this calendar year, at the time the new automobile license plates are &quot;sealed”, the State Traffic Department, unduly influenced by the city official who stopped the program of the sound car in November, refused to &quot;seal” the license plates to the sound car. Then all the police substations of the city of Sao Paulo and the police of many of the neighboring cities were sent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eingdom, Cure</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered. </span><span class="font4">booklets with a copy of the March </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao,</span><span class="font4"> which contained accounts of the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil and a protest against the Traffic Department’s refusing to seal the license plates. Further publicity was given by reporting it to Automobile Associations, Chamber of Commerce, etc. For eight months the sound car was driven without sealed license plates around Sao Paulo and to many of the neighboring towns, giving programs, and not once did an officer attempt to stop it. AU seemed to think that it was a &quot;hot potato” that had better not be picked up. In August the Automobile Club suggested that, if I would call upon the head of the Traffic Department and request him to have the plates sealed, he would probably do so. The result was that the license plates were sealed on August 20, in spite of the effort of the Hierarchy’s agent in the municipal office to the last to interfere. The amount of publicity given to the Kingdom message has been great and far-reaching as a result of this persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding feature of the year’s work was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ConsolationCure-Riches</span><span class="font4"> campaign. It was undoubtedly Jehovah’s loving provision that Brazil should have part in this wonderful campaign. For some time it had seemed that something should be done to bring the four-page paper called &quot;A Luz da Verdade” (In the Eight of Truth) into closer harmony with the then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine, so request was made to change its name and increase its size. Even before receiving your answer came the news that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> had been changed to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font4">and we realized with a thrill of rejoicing that Brazil would have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao,</span><span class="font4"> and that the other publications throughout the world would make the same change, a further step in the unifying of Jehovah’s earthly forces against the enemy. So, with thanksgiving to Jehovah, the first issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao </span><span class="font4">appeared in January, just in time to get into the campaign with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese. When the English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet reached this office, on January 24, it seemed that it would be impossible for us to get into the campaign unless the Lord should perform a miracle, because never before had a finished booklet been received in less than four months after the copy was sent in. However, it was realized that this campaign was being directed by Jehovah, so the copy was sent promptly by air express on January 27, and on February 26, unbelievable as it seems, 40,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklets were on the steamer leaving New York for Brazil, reaching here in good time for the campaign. The brethren were thrilled and rose to the occasion like true soldiers. They put them all out, and about 10,000 in other languages besides. During the closing days of the campaign, in order to place the literature in the hands of the people by June 30, the Sao Paulo company took over all the foreign </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font4">booklets (Portuguese was all gone) and gave them to the four pioneers in Sao Paulo and to the other publishers who would witness with them in the sections where these languages were spoken. The brethren worked faithfully, and Jehovah blessed their efforts. At the be</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ginnin</span><span class="font4">g of the campaign 350 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao</span><span class="font4"> were being mailed out each month; at its close, 1,200.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a part of the three months’ campaign, during &quot;Companions” Testimony Period, an assembly was held in Sao Paulo. This gave an opportunity for the pioneers who witness alone so much of the time, and others isolated, to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">meet</span><span class="font4"> with their brethren, to be encouraged, to encourage others, to partake of the Memorial and bear the Kingdom fruits to the people. Some who came long distances returned to their places with increased vision and strength, and have stimulated their brethren to greater activity in the Kingdom service. For those of Jehovah’s witnesses who are accustomed to meet regularly with others it may be somewhat difficult to realize what such an assembly means to pioneers who, from one year’s end to the next, go about alone among strangers, often of an entirely foreign tongue, having no contact with their own brethren except by correspondence, through the precious </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers, </span><span class="font4">which are so vital to our very existence, and by means of the tie that binds the anointed more closely than any physical or earthly ties, that of being sons of the Most High, brethren and fellow servants in Jehovah’s organization. Such are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not to be </span><span class="font4">found complaining, gossiping or faultfinding, but earnestly listening to instructions, joyfully taking part in the field service, and, during time of relaxation, telling others of their happy experiences in bearing the message of the Kingdom to those who will hear, and relating how Jehovah has guided and delivered them from the snare of the enemy. On the way to the Sao Paulo convention, one of these isolated pioneers met, by chance, a Jonadab to whom he had witnessed in a distant town a few months before. They journeyed together to the convention, both were baptized, and the newly interested brother returned to his home to enter the ranks as an auxiliary. This convention in Sao Paulo, April 14-17, was in some respects; -the best one yet held in Brazil. Ninety-eight attended the Memorial, 73 of them partaking of the emblems and 61 entering into the field service. In 299 hours in the field, 66 books and more than 1,300 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklets were placed in the hands of the people. Nineteen subscriptions to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao</span><span class="font4"> were taken. 3,607 people heard the gracious Kingdom message by means of the sound car and phonographs. At one meeting 16 indicated that they had learned of Jehovah’s organization within the last two years, 11 of whom symbolized their consecration by immersion at that convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The campaign was certainly directed of Jehovah. One marvels at its organization. Pull instructions in all details reached here in ample time to place them before the brethren so that we could move into action at exactly the same time and in exactly the same way as our other comrades in arms in other parts of the world. This unity of action was a source of strength and encouragement to the Lord’s people. And the reception of the message of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet was remarkable. Not a dog wagged his tongue. As one pioneer wrote: “It has waked the people up as nothing else has ever done, and it has caused a veritable earthquake in the Devil’s organization. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And Jehovah has crowned the year with a crystal-clear explanation of his theocratic organization. In order to bring this information properly before the Lord’s people in Brazil, a special 20-page issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Torre de Vigia</span><span class="font4"> containing the two articles in the June 1 and 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> was printed and sent out with an accompanying letter urging the brethren to study it carefully and then volunteer their services to Jehovah’s theocratic organization. The Sao Paulo company set aside all its study meetings for the study of this until completed, and was the first to adopt the resolution suggested in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers and Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers have placed more than half of the total literature and 60 percent of the bound books. This faithful band of soldiers report many hardships encountered in bearing the reproaches of Christ, but much joy in their privileges of service for the Kingdom. Especially now, the enemy is trying to make difficulties for our foreign brethren with this ‘‘America for the Americans”, ‘‘Brazil for the Brazilians” part of their ‘‘inbred” Ammonite scheme to rule the earth, but these faithful ones know that ‘‘the earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof”, and that of all in the earth most precious in His sight are his faithful witnesses, particularly those who have gladly left their comfortable abiding places to go to the ends of the earth to witness to his name. So on they go, trusting in Jehovah, looking to him for wisdom to guide them in this hour of danger. Two who have joined the pioneer ranks since the April campaign began are young girls of fifteen years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliaries increased in number during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">And Now the Jonadabs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Refreshing is the zeal of these whose eyes are opening to the hypocrisy of religion. One Polish Catholic family of father, mother and two daughters, aged 15 and 11 years, heard the Kingdom message at the time of the Sao Paulo convention, all four were baptized, and the eleven-year-old volunteered to take the place of her older sister sewing for their living, so that the sister could enter the pioneer service. The other three members of the family witness as they have opportunity, and are arranging their affairs so as to devote all their time to the Kingdom witness. Another Polish Jonadab came to the office, got a phonograph and the ‘‘Exposed” series of dises in Polish, took them home and played them for his Catholic neighbor, who, in turn, said: ‘‘So that’s the racket they’ve been putting over on us, those priests!” Out went the images and ‘‘holy” pictures; he wrote in to the office for literature, read it, sent for more literature and subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> is rejoicing in the knowledge of the truth, passing it on to his neighbors, and now he wants a phonograph, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Translations. We are grateful for the increased supply of literature in Portuguese. During the year there were translated in Brazil and published in Brooklyn the following booklets: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Armageddon, Universal War Near.</span><span class="font4"> The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font4">and the latest booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font4"> have also been translated and are expected to be published soon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> was reprinted, being printed for the first time in Brooklyn. The workmanship is far superior in every respect to the former booklet which was done by a printer in Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Attendance. The sound attendance in 1938 was 220,137, nearly double the 116,259, of the year previous. Considering the poverty and illiteracy of the millions in Brazil, besides the fact that the majority of the most active publishers are not able to speak the native language well, one can realize what a blessing is the sound equipment here. When the sound programs are given, the people crowd around the car and stand in small groups in the gateways and on the sidewalks as far as the eye can see, listening intently to every word from beg</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inning</span><span class="font4"> to end of the half-hour programs. Seldom is opposition to the message shown by those who listen. Some are heard to say regretfully as the program closes: “Oh, they are going to leave now! ” The children come by the hundreds as soon as the program begins. It is a problem to keep them from climbing all over the car, but they are usually obedient when asked not to touch the car during the playing of the discs.. It is surprising what they, too, learn of Jehovah’s gracious purposes. One eight-year-old was heard to say to another at the end of the lecture “Jehovah”: “No one would try to defy God, surely.” The other answered earnestly: “Yes, some try, but they can never succeed. ’ ’ On the occasion of a program in a small town recently, after calling on the police officials to inform them that the Watch Tower sound ear had come to give some programs in their city, presenting them with booklets and inviting them to hear the program, inquiring of them the best locations so as not to disturb religious meetings, hospitals, etc., the publishers were told that the best place of all was the town square. There is always a Catholic church on the town square, and this town was no exception. When this was called to the attention of the police, he said that it was an hour before any service, that “of course, the priest would object if he were consulted, but he doesn’t run this town”. So the first program was given at the town square. After covering the town, we passed the church about noon on the way to our last program just as the people were coming out. The crowd came down the street, the men taking their places on one side of the car, the women on the other side. It was soon realized that the priest had incited this mob to stop the Kingdom witness. The program continued, while prayers went up to Jehovah for wisdom. In a few minutes, the police officials and mayor were seen a short distance away; the crowd quieted down. At the end of the first lecture the police officer stepped to the car and said: “The town has revolted against your programs. I would suggest that you stop. However, you have a perfect right to give forth your message, and liberty to continue if you desire to. ’ ’ He was told that this was a message of life, that there was no desire to force unwilling ones to hear it, that there were some, however, who would no doubt want to hear. Asked if he and the others with </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> would remain the short time to the end of the program, he assured us that he would remain, and see that we were not molested. As the program continued, one of the women sent down by the priest was heard to say: ‘ ‘ That is the truth. ’ ’ The program was finished, the officer presented with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Biches, </span><span class="font4">and the car went on its way to the next town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Model Studies. With the use of the Spanish &quot;Exposed” dises, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> booklet in Spanish and the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese, the various companies are carrying on Model Studies in their regular meeting places and in homes of the interested. One such study in the meeting hall of the Sao Paulo company on Sunday nights is attended by from 30 to 40 persons, many of them newcomers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publicity. In answer to a full front-page attack in a German newspaper, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deutscher Morgen,</span><span class="font4"> the Society entered suit against the publication, and in the last issue of A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Jmz da Verdade</span><span class="font4"> (now </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao)</span><span class="font4"> wrote an open letter to the press, answering it. 10,000 copies were printed and distributed, a copy being sent to every newspaper in Brazil. A few papers had taken up the lies and printed them, but the court action and publicity have evidently deterred others from &quot;joining in the chorus”. In the March issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao</span><span class="font4"> considerable space was given to the persecution in Brazil as respects the pioneers and the sound car, and mention was also made of the suit against the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deutscher Morgen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Copies of this issue were mailed to police and other officials in every community where there had been interference, to the federal &quot;&nbsp;Interventors ” of every State and to President Vargas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An eventful year has closed; an interesting one is opening. In the camp of the enemy is darkness and it is full of plots against Jehovah’s anointed. In the camp of Jehovah’s people there is light ever-increasing, and the organization is being drawn into closer harmony and unity. We are eagerly awaiting the report of the world-wide convention with its center in London, confident that it has been an important maneuver of the forces of Jehovah in this greatest conflict of all ages. We pray for the peace of Zion, and, by His grace, will use all our powers to preserve that peace and present a solid front against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We realize, with deep appreciation to Jehovah, how, in spite of your many and increasing responsibilities and activities, you have entered into our problems here, and your loving counsel and encouragement have been a stimulus to us. We thank Jehovah for your faithful service, and that of our other brethren at the Brooklyn office who have also ministered to our needs in Brazil, and at the close of this strenuous, eventful year we realize a drawing closer together with you and the other faithful in all the earth, as never before. May Jehovah bless our united service in his theocratic government during the momentous year we now enter.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch in British Guiana, at Georgetown, Demerara, has made some progress in the work during the year. The publishers are limited, and they work under adverse conditions. During the year they have had three service conventions, which refreshed those attending and stimulated the field service. The Jonadabs are showing interest and having a part in the work, and thus some of the “great multitude” class are coming from that land, even as the Lord foretold they would come from every land, kindred and tongue. The report of the field service is to this effect: The number of books and booklets placed with the people, 9,301; hours in the field, 3,600; attendance at phonograph meetings, 1,265; phonographs in operation, 10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The “strange work” of Jehovah has made real progress in the Dominion of Canada during the fiscal year. Many newly interested persons have openly announced themselves on the side of Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus and now are actively engaged in the “strange work” of telling others that religion is a snare and a racket and that God’s kingdom with Christ as King is the only hope for the human race. To them Christianity has become a real thing. They clearly see that a Christian must follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus by obeying God’s law and that, in doing so, he is certain to have persecution heaped upon him. The anointed remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord have marched forward side by side, and in the face of increased opposition they have accomplished far more than was done during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the year total 1,252,923. 3,113 publishers have regularly engaged in the field work, spending 641,544 hours in bearing testimony to the people in person and by sound machines, and the persons obtaining this literature totaled during the year 912,770. As a general rule an average of four persons in a family peruse the literature that is placed in the family, so that we can easily estimate upward of three million persons who have become acquainted with the Kingdom message during the year. A summary of the work of witnessing in the field is as follows :</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great and enthusiastic convention of the Lord’s people held at Columbus, Ohio, September 15-20,1937, really marked the decided impetus in behalf of the witness work in Canada. The Society’s branch servant has to say of the Canadian work the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in the whole of Canada were thrilled with the blessings and favors from that convention, and in the zeal of the Lord they have gone forward this year as one army to fulfill God’s commandments, and it is a pleasure to report that there is an increase in every phase of service. More publishers, hours, literature, more of everything, and all to the honor and glory of our Father’s great and holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prepared for further work, we rejoiced when we first learned the news that Jehovah’s people were to launch the greatest attack to date upon the Devil’s stronghold, and this was to be for three months, April, May and June, with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font4"> Never before was such preparation made for a campaign. In the two months, February and March, every detail of the service was organized. Companies everywhere reported their determination to obtain their quota, and the joy and zeal of the Lord’s people abounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hundreds of interested people who never before had engaged in the service were prepared to serve, and on April 9 we went forth as one man, everyone on tiptoes to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> poured in. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> flowed out to the people like a river. A quota of 700,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font4"> 70,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> 7,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, and 3,500 publishers was fixed. It was cause for much rejoicing when the June figures showed that over 4,000 publishers had taken part in this campaign. At the end of the three months all who had engaged wholeheartedly knew we had Jehovah’s blessing, and rejoiced even though physically tired with the continuous fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for last year showed a remarkable increase in the number of publishers, yet this year even excels that. There has been an increase of 570 pubfishers in the monthly average, meaning an average of 3,113 publishers as against 2,543 in 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is every indication that this number will be increased. The publishers are reporting interest from all parts of the country. Particularly is this true where there have been severe conditions to contend with, such as the drought in the West and extreme labor conditions in British Columbia. The west coast of Canada has been very badly hit owing to the Chino-Japanese war, and yet over the past year there has been a wonderful increase in tliis area, particularly in Vancouver. More laborers are needed to call on the interested with followup work and back calls, to assist these lovers of righteousness to take their stand on the Lord’s side. There is work for everyone to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a result of the additional 570 publishers monthly, there have been reported 153,069 more hours this year. 40,000 more bound books have been placed, and 295,000 more booklets. This brings our grand total of literature to 1,252,923. The sound attendance has increased by 200,000; bach calls, practically 59,000. The number of phonographs has increased by 467, although we have supplied nearly 1,000 to the publishers. Many of these have replaced the older type machine with new ones. An increase is also seen in the large sound machines, 19 more being in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nine-day periods have been a real impetus to the work. It is always noticeable that the months which include these special periods are much higher in their totals than the others. There are many who make a special effort to take part in these witness periods. Of the six special campaigns, the “Companions” Period, April 9-17, stands out as the peak period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that the j»ew year will see, not special weeks, but special periods of the duration of a month, we know that there will be a greater increase in the service, and it will enable many who are at present irregular to become more active, and so rejoice in the loving provision made by Jehovah for his people to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a splendid increase in the pioneer service. Our enrollment list is higher at the present time than any previous year. To date, the enrollment is 249. During the winter season many brethren find it impossible to stand the very severe conditions and they retire for some months, although the majority keep on working in the towns, or with toboggans or cutters in the rurals. Over the year, the average number of pioneers reporting monthly was 210, an average monthly of 34 more than during 1937. The hours have increased by 45,000, and a fine increase is seen in the books and booklets placed. There is also an increase in the attendance at sound-machine lectures, and over 21,000 back calls made. The pioneers throughout the land have done grand service. Some parties have worked in practically 100-percent Catholic districts, and still went forward with their service. In other districts the pioneers report splendid interest, and there is a call for more helpers to assist in establishing studies and carrying forward the back-call service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With your consent thirty special pioneers were chosen from the pioneer ranks, and appointed to serve in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. Splendid work has been done by these brethren. Many series are going, studies established, and interested people have been brought to the meetings. Without doubt, the presence of these special pioneers in the companies has been the means of stimulating other publishers to more work with the sound equipment. At present the special pioneers from Toronto and Montreal are working with the brethren at</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ottawa, owing to opposition which was created during the time of the lecture ‘ ‘ Face the Facts ’ There are now 23 special pioneers at Ottawa. They are meeting the opposition and also the interest, and are of great assistance to the local company in the fight against the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is every indication of the multitude coming forward, not only to the meetings, but participating in the service. In these figures we have evidence of this fact. There has been a monthly average of 2,826 publishers in the field, as against the number last year, which was 2,307, showing an average of 519 more publishers monthly in the field this year. There is no doubt that during the next year there will be a further increase, for those who hear also &quot;say, Come”. The letters we continually receive in this office give every evidence that many more are opening their eyes to realize that the Lord has a people on the earth today who are His. Many ask for guidance and instruction on how to organize. As this report is being compiled the following letter comes to hand:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The company publishers and isolated servants have increased the output of literature from 41,942 to 70,211, and the booklets from 467,000 to 701,000. There have been 80,000 more hours devoted to the field service. This does not include the great amount of time spent this year in folder distribution, announcing the public meetings, ‘sandwich’ parades, etc. It is very gratifying to note Jehovah’s blessing on the faithful service of the company publishers and isolated, and we know that there are greater blessings and favors yet in store during the coming year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fourteen brethren have been working during the year as divisional servants. These, with four others, are now organized as zone servants. During the year all these brethren have done very fine work, organizing companies, joining the publishers in the field work, exhorting the brethren to faithful service, and assisting the interested. They have labored well, and the work has gone forward in the strength of the Lord to his praise. We believe that much of the increase in the service has been due to the faithful service of these brethren, and now they have greater privileges. Without doubt the Lord’s blessing is upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four brethren have engaged in this branch of the service. They have attended service assemblies, strengthened the brethren, organized companies, and attended court trials, assisting the accused. Under the new zoning arrangements only two brethren will serve as regionals, and one brother will serve the Ukrainian brethren part time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everyone in the Bethel home has labored faithfully in the service. It has been necessary on many occasions for evening work to be done, and also at times over the week-ends. There has been much service in the office which has been additional to the regular routine, such as preparing for the three months’ campaign, April to June, the preparations necessary for the international convention and the lecture “Face the Facts”, also the further organization instructions which are now in operation world-wide. Everyone has worked with a ready mind and a willing spirit, and, in addition, much service has been done in the field and there has been an increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a marked increase in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, but the greatest increase is seen in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> due to the special three months’ campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our printing presses have been kept very busy during the last year, and the figures show that we have printed one million more pieces during 1938 than in 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over 900 phonographs have been dispatched this year to the publishers, many of these newer machines replacing the older type. There are now 2,484 in use amongst the brethren. The publishers who use the phonograph can hardly imagine themselves working without it. We are grateful indeed for the many lectures which have been made, “Safety,” “Warning,” “Worshiping God,” “Violence,” “Relief” and “Resolution”. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font4"> are in use, and we recognize the fact that the truth presented by these records enables the people to really see their position. It helps us to do the Lord’s work in the Lord’s way. It cuts out argument, personal shining, and breaks down prejudice, and instead of a worker’s contending for the truth at the doors, the truth can now be presented with authority. It appears that the use of the phonograph and records is one of the chief means the Lord is using to gather the “multitude”. There is nothing to equal it on the back-call service, as also the Sunday evening public lectures. There are still greater opportunities of service with the phonograph and records, once all become so minded as to see that Jehovah’s way is always the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much opposition has been encountered throughout the land; the Catholic Hierarchy, working through employers of labor, have had certain men dismissed because of their activity for the truth. Priests have organized mobs to attack Jehovah’s witnesses and have worked in the local districts to bring Jehovah’s witnesses into disrepute. The chief method of attack, however, has been through the courts. The Hierarchy, through their agencies, have done all possible to interfere with the work, yet, in spite of their vicious assaults, the Lord’s work has prospered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In northern Ontario there is a large French-Canadian population and interest in the truth is growing. Studies have been started among these French people. In Montreal, P. Q., the interest among the French people is quickening. Hundreds of French Catholics in Montreal know the truth and would stand for it were they not afraid of the priests’ action. If they stood for the truth their jobs would be lost. The Hierarchy’s attempt to break down the work has failed. They have been fought at every turn. True it is, the expense of fighting through the courts has been a very heavy burden on the Society. The most eminent criminal counsel in Canada, R. L. Calder, K.C., has been used continuously on our eases, and this has assisted in keeping the door open for the fight to go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Practically every charge has been laid against us, including “selling without a license’’, “soliciting without a license,” ' ‘ soliciting for books by means of a phonograph, ” “ disorderly conduct,” “indecent assault,” “blasphemous libel,” “defamatory libel,” “distributing seditious literature,” “seditious conspiracy. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Crown prosecutor in Montreal recently demanded of our counsel that Jehovah’s witnesses cease their work until one of the eases was settled. Reply was given that we would not let up, whether the case was settled in our favor or not. It was then stated that the police would redouble their efforts against us and arrest the witnesses at every opportunity. The company at Montreal and the pioneers were informed of this threat, but their answer was that they would go forward, no matter what the police or the Hierarchy would do. Without doubt, the Lord’s blessing has been upon their determined stand and faithfulness under this increased opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today, the majority of French Canadians in the province of Quebec who are in the truth were Catholics a short time ago. More are attending the meetings. Ten French-Canadian pioneers are working in Montreal, in addition to the eight special pioneers who have been there for six months. There have been six pioneers serving in Quebec province. Two of these were told months ago by the Provincial Police that they could arrest them any time. The brothers kept on working and were arrested a few weeks ago and charged with distributing seditious literature. They are out on bail, and the case is to be tried in November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fight is on, and well we know it in the Quebec district, but with determination and entire trust and confidence in Jehovah we all move forward in the fight, determined to assist the multitude of “prisoners” who will yet come forward and take their stand on the Lord’s side. Over 100 English and French-Canadian brethren went from Montreal to the convention at Ottawa to participate in the advertising for the lecture “Face the Facts’’. On returning, a French brother gathered together 140 interested Frbnch Canadians and gave them the chief points of the Saturday and Sunday speeches at the International Convention. The Montreal company has increased in publishers and in service during the last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">International Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The five cities chosen were Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver. Everything was well organized, and the work went smoothly. Large auditoriums were engaged, and brethren from all over the province came to help at the nearest convention point. Many interested took a share in the distribution of folders, some going out in sound cars, and although such work cannot be put into figures on paper, we believe that many of these interested people will continue to serve the Lord with gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the convention the Lord opened the windows of heaven and poured out his blessing. Such a blessing came to the Jona-dabs that words fail to express the blessedness of Jehovah’s goodness. It almost seemed like a second Pentecost when we saw the truth that was revealed to all on Saturday afternoon regarding the divine mandate, and the glorious and most precious and blessed privilege that will be the part of the earthly class of God’s righteous creatures. Jonadabs and anointed rejoiced greatly. Thankfulness was in each and every heart when this glorious purpose was revealed. Truly, we said, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard . . . the things which God hath prepared for those that love him.’’ This great revealed purpose, together with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles on “Lovers of Righteousness’’, is binding the anointed and Jonadabs in a bond which cannot be broken; for all rejoice in the loving-kindness of the gracious Creator, who openeth His hand and satisfieth the desire of every living thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mighty witness delivered on Sunday afternoon was like the voice of the Lord thundering upon the waters. The message roared, and we knew it was the Lord speaking through his own agency. We knew the opportunity was being given to the people to face the facts, and to know what to do. Never before have we seen such rapt attention being given by an audience. To see 10,000 people sitting through an hour’s lecture, practically without moving, and then to join in the applause, the resolutions, and the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font4">en, made us realize that Jehovah has many people yet who love righteousness, and who sigh and cry for the abominations in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was like sounding a death-knell to the religionists and others who were worshiping the beast and his image and making common cause with this Devil-erected monstrosity. It was a message of doom, and we know that if they never receive another witness given in such a way, they have had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since this great lecture the convention cities in Canada have moved in the wake of the witness and its interest, and have hurried quickly to press the battle to the gate, breaking through where the breach has been made, fighting hard to battle through the enemy’s stronghold and help the prisoners to see and follow the blazing torch placed in their pathway on Sunday, September 11. We know that many minds will be open to the truth now. Many are wondering what to do, and with all speed we are rushing in to assist and to comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of central and southern Europe are now subjected to unrighteous treatment in excess of any other place on earth. The rank and file of the people have been deprived of their personal liberties, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship; they are regimented and compelled to do what the rulers direct must be done, whether that be right or wrong, and the command of the ruler is almost always wrong. The people are compelled to earry the great burden of taxation to provide the means for the small number who have rule to accomplish what they desire. The people are put in fear of their present existence on earth, and their hope for the world to eome is destroyed. The people in that part of the earth now sigh and cry and mourn because of the unrighteous and wicked conditions with which they have been surrounded. In the light of these indisputable faets mark these words of the Most High: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”—Prov. 29: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time, for a short period, in whieh the people in that section of the earth indulged in song and rejoicing, but now their songs of gladness have ceased and they are sad of countenance and heavy of heart. In the great World War millions of young men, the very flower of the population, were shoved into the war and told that the conflict would make the earth a more desirable place to live. Since the war the woes of the people have increased and continue to grow worse. And the reason ? The words of the Lord giving answer are: “When the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” Who rules ? Fascists and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Shortly following the World War the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was restored to temporal power. Italy, Germany and the Baltic States and other parts of that land fell under the heel of the harsh dictators. Religious racketeers and ambitious politicians formed the “corporate state”, the so-called “church state”, and the dictatorial rule is in vogue. That rule is extremely wicked, and the people mourn. This is further fulfillment of the prophetic words uttered by the Lord, “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:12) The Hierarchy sees to it that the people are kept in ignorance of these great prophetic truths as stated in the Bible, and they sigh and cry and mourn and do not understand the reason why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then again we see that God through his prophet Ezekiel commanded those who are devoted to him to go throughout the land and inform the people as to why this terrible condition has come to pass and what the future holds for mankind, both for the obedient and for the disobedient. Those who love the Lord have attempted to obey this command. (Ezek. 9:1-7) The ruling factors have vigorously fought against the spreading of the knowledge of God’s Word, in order that the people might be kept in ignorance and find no way of relief but be continuously subjected to the rule of the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly after the World War the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, acting for Jehovah’s witnesses and for the purpose of carrying out God’s commandments, established its main operating office at Switzerland. That land appeared to be the most liberal and democratic. For more than a thousand years it had resisted the cruel assaults by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the House of Hapsburg had been expelled, and the people enjoyed a measure of liberty. It seemed to be the Lord’s will that the Society’s Central European office should be set up in that land; and it was done. From its office in Berne, Switzerland, the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been directed and has been carried on in the countries of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Rumania, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Italy is the chief official place of the Devil’s religious agents, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. From that point the wicked Inquisition was carried on for years, and the people of Spain and other countries round about suffered greatly and mourned. Now the Hierarchy-Fascist crowd prosecutes a wicked war to destroy Spain because that country rebelled against the Papacy. After the War the persecution of the true followers of Christ in Italy came to the front, the Papacy leading in that persecution, and the totali-. tarian rule reared its hideous head, and Mussolini and the pope joined hands and now work together. Then followed the totalitarian rule in Germany, where Jehovah’s witnesses, because of their faithfulness to God and his kingdom, have been more cruelly persecuted than in any other place under the sun. The persecution of Christians in Germany during the past five years has been worse than the persecution by the Hierarchy in carrying on the cruel Inquisition of the sixteenth century. The wickedness of the ruling powers has increased and the mourning of the people has increased. The property of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany was seized and their work destroyed. A branch office had been established in Austria, and the Papacy and the Nazis saw that this was taken away. The persecution in Poland has greatly increased; likewise in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Rumania, Greece, and other nations of that part of the earth. In the face of all this cruel persecution a few faithful witnesses of the Lord have pushed on giving the warning to the mourning population and holding high the banner of God’s kingdom in order that those who desire to flee and who have the faith and confidence in the Lord to flee may hurry off to the kingdom of God under Christ and find a place of safety. A faithful servant of the Lord was sent from America by the Society to take charge of the Central European office, and since then that office has been carried on in full harmony with the Society’s headquarters at Brooklyn. Honest people will appreciate the following excerpts from his report filed in this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all humility before the Lord and deep appreciation of his goodness and loving care, I report herewith to you, Brother Rutherford, the onward march of Jehovah’s war-organization in Central Europe, where it is my privilege to enjoy an active and interesting share in the Kingdom work for the last twelveyears. Recognizing Jehovah’s grace in all the progress made, I trust that my report will help the anointed and the Jonadabs to realize the fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecies concerning the peace and prosperity of his people even in the midst of great difficulties, malicious opposition and wicked persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No real brother or sister, who is fully devoted to the Lord, being of the remnant gathered in the temple or a Jonadab riding along in Jehu’s chariot, can have any doubts as to Jehovah’s protecting, guiding and governing his people and his work on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is evidence upon evidence that Jehovah is leading and establishing the steps of the righteous, his approved ones on earth, who are now marching in complete unity over the “high places’’ of unselfish and joyful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking back, we are amazed to see how the Lord has led his people all the way, how he has provided for all requirements and has equipped his organization for this present time of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lesson of Jehovah’s sovereign power and absolute rule over his people and his work as presented in the recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> is truly food in season of utmost importance for all who wish to keep in line and in step with the movement of the Lord as he rides majestically onward to certain victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last vestige of error, confusion and possible human interference with Jehovah’s war-organization on the part of misinformed or willfully ignorant individuals is now being cleared away. The Lord is now in full command, and the Society, that “wise and faithful servant’’, has taken its rightful position in the Lord’s arrangement, and all things pertaining to the Kingdom service are now set in order. There is therefore now no place in God’s organization for those who rant about personal liberties or individual rights. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The advancement of the Lord’s people on the King’s ‘ ‘ highway’’, their peace and prosperity, is largely due to their appreciation of their proper relationship to Jehovah and Christ as the Higher Powers, also to their understanding that Jehovah and Christ are now in full command of the invisible and visible organization. Now every soul must render joyful and complete obedience to that Greater Prophet and Commander of the Lord’s army, or perish from among the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Can anyone be so blind as not to recognize that the Lord himself from the beginning has built up his visible organization on earth and that he is using it to his own honor and glory as his publicity agent to advertise the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g and his kingdom throughout the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely, the Society is doing the work of the Lord as he has commanded, and, recognizing at all times the “Higher Powers’’, keeps itself separated or unspotted from the Devil’s world or organization.—James 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What I can report concerning the Lord’s work in Central Europe will confirm the Scriptural explanations given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on “organization’’ and help to prove that the Lord has brought about the better condition, as gold is better than brass, that he has perfected his organization everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the outstanding proofs that the Society is the Lord’s representative on earth is the fact that it joyfully partakes of the afflictions of the gospel and courageously bears the reproaches of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was my privilege to accompany Brother Rutherford early in the year 1933 to Germany. At that time the enemy began to invade the “land of Judah’’, that is, the special attacks upon the people who praise Jehovah commenced. Some of the literature was then banned, the Society’s property was threatened with confiscation, and the persecution of the brethren began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Brother Rutherford humbly and earnestly presented the case to the Lord in prayer and asked for his guidance in face of the increasing difficulties in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The answer to our prayers came from the Lord in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> of November, 1933, with the article ‘Fear not those that can kill the body ordy; but fear only Jehovah’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not the prerogative of any man to tell the brethren in Germany what they should do in the face of such terrible opposition. But the Lord himself by his Word clearly gave the direction to march out into the open and face the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although it is true that some fearful ones succumbed in the test and were shaken out of the Lord’s Kingdom organization, many have maintained their integrity and have kept the faith under the most trying circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last five years of Nazi-terror in that land, we have kept in touch with our German brethren who to this day receive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other literature. This is done at the risk of their liberty and life. Although they suffer much (some were murdered, and more than 6,000 are kept in prisons and concentration camps), they are not without hope and comfort. On the contrary, the reports which we regularly receive express triumphant faith and joy in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the Society’s direction these letters and reports were gathered and published in book form. Nearly ten thousand copies of this book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity</span><span class="font4"> (in German), have already been distributed, chiefly in Switzerland, where they are exhibited in the bookstores and newspaper stands. Editions in other languages, such as English, French, Hollandish and Swedish, are in course of preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The famous German writer, Dr. Thomas Mann, formerly professor in the university at Bonn on the Rhine, having received a copy of this book, wrote the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I still owe you my thanks not merely as an act of politeness, but also a debt of the heart for the present of your book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity.</span><span class="font4"> I have read your book and its terrible documentation with the deepest emotion. I cannot describe the mixed feeling of abhorrence and loathing which filled my heart while perusing these records of human degradation and abominable cruelty. Human speech fails in the presence of such unspeakable perversity which is revealed in the pages on which the awful sufferings of these innocent men and women, who firmly hold fast to their faith, are recorded. In viewing such indescribable conditions the voice would feign be silent, but keeping quiet would serve only the moral indifference of the world and the despicable noninterference policy and make for a guilty conscience. Will it be possible to shock the world even a moment by your presentation of these disgusting facts? One hardly dares to hope for it. At any rate, you have done your duty by publishing this book openly, and it seems to me that there is no greater appeal to the World’s conscience than this publication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Protestant minister, Th. Bruppacher, in a Swiss journal published in Zurich, dated August 19, 1938, publishes a long article about the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity.</span><span class="font4"> Amongst other things he writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;This is the book of martyrdom of the Earnest Bible Students in Germany . . . While the German church controversy enjoys the favorable interest of official ‘Christendom’, we have here an unobserved company suffering in the foremost posts. ‘While men who call themselves Christians have failed in the decisive test, these unknown witnesses of Jehovah as Christian martyrs are maintaining unshakable opposition against coercion of conscience and heathen idolatry, and this after five years of terror in Germany. The fact that about 6,000 of these Christians are withstanding courageously the Nazi-tenor in the prisons, penitentiaries and concentration camps and continue to maintain their Christian faith, is worthy, to be noted by everyone who stands for liberty in matters of faith and conscience.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘Honor to whom honor is due! The future church historian must some day acknowledge that not the great churches, but several of the slandered and scoffed-at people of the sects, were the ones who stood up first of all against the rage of the Nazi-demon and who dared to make opposition according to the faith. They suffer and bleed because as ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’ and candidates for the Kingdom of Christ they refuse the worship of Hitler, the swastika, the German greeting and the forced participation in the elections. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘We would like to feel more of this strong salt and spiritual fire in our different church papers and missionary journals. Of course, no special honors of men are reported, but there is a simple and unshakable belief and conviction of the honor of Him who in fact bore the crown of thorns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All in all, these peculiar Christians are accounted worthy to suffer for His name’s sake and humbly they have proved that they really know how to maintain their high title: ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He who permits these documents to speak to him in all sincerity will see the maligned Earnest Bible Students in a new light. He will not again judge them quickly in his own selfrighteousness, but he will desire that his own church might have a spark of their simple faith as overeomers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Editors of newspapers have taken occasion to call attention to the mournful condition of the people and to speak of the faith and devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses in resisting totalitarian-Hierarchy-combine rule. From one of these papers the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Volksrecht,</span><span class="font5"> Zurich, August 3, 1938 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . One of the worst chapters is that about robbing the parents of their children and ill-treating them. The nation which boasts itself of having made the family-life a healthy organism here records in the verdicts of the courts for minors that a child of high moral standing can at the same time be considered a bad child, if it is not reliable in a political way, and that means, if it takes the fourth commandment to honor father and mother seriously, or if it puts God before the idolized ‘ Fuehrer ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The book consists of brief, unbiased records of facts, but these are so gripping that the reading almost brings physical pain. Nevertheless, this documentation should get into many hands; for in this time of error and confusion, when many who also claim to be Christians have long since betrayed God and Christ, it is very inspiring to note how these Bible Students confess their faith courageously as a worthy example. They suffer more than humanly and often enough they suffer death for their belief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Der Oeffentliche Dienst</span><span class="font5"> (Public Service), Zurich, July 29, 1938:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Crimes, which cry to heaven.</span><span class="font4"> People of good will! In the more interior part of Switzerland [this refers to the two cantons of Lucerne and Zug, which are strongholds of the Hierarchy] the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses enlightening the people about the swastika against Christianity were forbidden on the ground of fairy tales imported from Hitler-Germany that Jehovah’s witnesses are Communists. [These verdicts were later canceled by the Supreme Court of Switzerland.] Does Catholicism envy the Bible Students their martyrdom, or is it the old hatred against ‘heretics’, because laymen dare to interpret the Bible without the papal authority? Superfluously the publishers express their aloofness as far as the Biblical discussions in this book are concerned. But the editors should feel that it is an honor to serve such courageous men, who are not afraid of death, and who are persecuted for faith and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If the European statesmen and party leaders only had a small portion of this courage, possessed by Jehovah’s witnesses, the world might have been spared the crimes of the demons of our time, which cry to heaven. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A protest concerning the persecution of our brethren in Danzig was submitted also to the League of Nations, and all the delegates of the various governments present at Geneva, Switzerland, received a copy of this protest and some of them also a verbal testimony. The High Commissioner of the League of Nations for Danzig, Prof. Dr. Burckhardt, admitted the injustice of the German Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Westdeutscher' Beobachter,</span><span class="font4"> Cologne, devoted a whole page to slanders and lies about the president of the Society and about Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. Photos of Jewish-looking men and women were reproduced in this German newspaper with the colossal lie that they represent the leaders of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, though these photos are absolutely unknown amongst the Lord’s people in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soon another trial instigated by the German Ministry for Propaganda will take place at Berne, Switzerland, which will give us another opportunity to expose the Nazi gangsters as the biggest liars that the world has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have in our possession many documents which clearly prove the conspiracy between the Hierarchy and the Nazis in their attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Switzerland, Poland and Hungary, in the Roman Catholic sections of these countries, it often happens that our brethren are attacked openly by the mob which is incited by the Catholic priests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the face of all this cruel persecution, which would have deterred many people from going ahead aside from those who have full faith in God, Jehovah’s witnesses have pushed forward, continuing fearlessly to proclaim the name of Jehovah God and the blessings his kingdom under Christ will bring to the people. Many have heard, and those who have heard have ceased mourning, because they have learned from God’s Word that he foreknew and foretold this wicked persecution of his faithful servants which would take place just preceding Armageddon. They look for complete deliverance at the hand of Jehovah under Christ Jesus, who, within a short time, will lead the assault against the combined enemy of Fascism and Roman Catholicism. The Society’s local servant at the Central European office further says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increased violence in several countries interfered, of course, with the organized activity, yet the distribution of booklets in Central Europe was greater than last year. The total distribution shows an increase of 11,000 copies as compared with last year, and this was largely due to the three-month campaign with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font4"> The activity of the companies shows an increase, while the activity of pioneers was hampered greatly by the fact that the pioneers were chased from one country to another, and now all the German pioneers are expelled from Yugoslavia, Hungary and Bulgaria, and in several other countries they are threatened with expulsion. There are now about fifty German brethren who fled from the persecution in Germany and then worked as pioneers in several other countries and now have no place where to lay their heads. Recently there was a conference at Evian, France, to take care of such unfortunate refugees, but nothing was done to alleviate their sufferings. The conference adjourned and was transferred to London, presided over by Lord Winterton, to whom the case of our brethren was also submitted in a letter of August 12, 1938. In this letter we quoted the words of the psalmist: ‘Blessed are they that think of the poor. In the day of wrath Jehovah will save them. Jehovah will protect them and keep them alive. They will be blessed upon the earth, and he will not cause them to be the prey of their enemies. ’—Psalm 41: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to provide a place of refuge for these brethren, Brother Rutherford has arranged to buy some farms. Other pioneers are being transferred to Australia, to Africa, and to South America also at the expense of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is clearly manifest that the Devil has organized his forces in order to hinder as much as possible the witness work, yet the determination of the Lord’s people in Central Europe to face the hordes of the enemy in open battle could not be broken. Many of our brethren live in the Sudeten district of Czechoslovakia, now occupied by Hitler, and now the work will be forbidden in that section also. There was no terrorism in that section before Hitler came, but now there will be, and that with the consent of the hypocritical democracies which, as we expected, yielded to Hitler’s boisterous bluff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholic Action also attacked the work by publishing slanderous reports in the newspapers and by causing disturbances in our public meetings. For this reason the quota could not be reached everywhere, but the result of our united and courageous efforts is very gratifying and testifies of the Lord’s sustaining power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the great persecution upon the faithful followers of Christ in the land of Germany, the following other cases have been given attention by the Society’s Central European office, to wit:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark108"><span class="font5">Known cases of ill-treatment</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark109"><span class="font5">Charges laid against publishers by police</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark110"><span class="font5">Number of arrests</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark111"><span class="font5">Prison sentences total about (years)</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fines, court costs, counsel fees (Swiss francs) 20,000</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark112"><span class="font5">Confiscations of literature</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font5">Condemnations</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark113"><span class="font5">Acquittals by lower or higher courts</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark114"><span class="font5">Discharged without trial</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an evidence of the faithful devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses and of theii’ fearlessness in serving God and his King, be it noted that in the fiscal year ended they have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 2,074,318, which is in excess of the year previous. These workers have spent 728,709 hours in the field. People that have listened to the speech reproduced on phonographs have numbered 385,261, and in this work 1,243 phonographs have been employed, 41 transcription machines, and 17 cars bearing sound equipment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The increase of 72,000 copies in the production of books is due to the special activity with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eiches</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies;</span><span class="font4"> and the same is true of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> with regard to booklets. The decrease of 47,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and 13,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> printed this year is partly due to the fact that the shipments to Austria have been discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 7,000 books and 446,000 booklets were printed by worldly concerns in other countries under the supervision of this office. It is slightly more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Farm</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s blessing has also been manifest upon the Society’s farm near Berne. A new stable was built, more land was bought, and the property has doubled in value as a result of diligent work. The farm has produced almost double, as compared with last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event in Europe was, however, the worldwide convention and Brother Butherford’s lectures at London, the one with special blessings for the Jonadabs, and the other as the most fearless battle against the enemy that was ever waged on earth thus far. Many of the brethren and Jonadabs in Central Europe heard both lectures over the radio. It was my privilege to be present at London, for which I was very grateful to you, Brother Butherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am certain that the Greater-than-Solomon, Christ Jesus, shall finish the building program and carry it forward to a glorious climax. The Lord himself is leading his people from grace to grace and from strength to strength. Hearing his gracious words in the temple, we sing aloud his praises. Personal matters and unimportant issues no longer mar the beauty of our song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s people never quail before the enemy, and they are not intimidated by Goliath’s boastful threats; but sensing the danger, they realize that order and discipline must now be maintained at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assuring you, Brother Rutherford, of our great love for you and for all our brethren of the remnant and the Jonadabs throughout the world, I close this report in quoting Psalm three, which in the German Bible is called “A Morning PrayerSong when in Distress”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Lord, how are' they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. Many there be [that] say of my sold, There is no help for him in God. But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. I laid me down and slept; I a waked; for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God; for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the general result of Jehovah’s &quot;strange work” directed from the Central European office is embraced in the foregoing, attention is here called to certain things relative to the respective countries wherein work has been done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s work was dissolved by the Hierarchy and its allies in Austria before Hitler marched in. Knowing that Hitler was marching his armies into Austria, and profiting by the experiences in Germany, the Society’s property in Vienna was sold and the money removed before Hitler came. When Hitler’s wicked assistants marched into Austria some of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and imprisoned. Some of the Society’s literature was found, and the brethren having it were immediately taken away to concentration camps. More of the brethren have remained steadfast in the Lord and, by the Lord’s grace, these still are able to be provided with copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">from time to time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Belgium lias increased during the year. The interested are forming study classes, and those engaged in publishing the Kingdom message are increasing. Eighteen pioneers are in the field, and these are supported by the company workers. From the Society’s local servant’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event during the year was, of course, the campaign with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font4"> It seems that never before has the Lord placed in the hands of his people a publication that so succinctly and trenchantly draws the issue. People in these unenlightened countries had difficulty in the past in grasping the doctrinal truths, but here is exposed in all its nakedness the institution which has been oppressing and cheating them for centuries, and with which they are so familiar. No wonder, then, that they are able to more quickly grasp its meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One example is worth mentioning. A cattle dealer happened to obtain a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> a little while ago and came into the office two days later for 50 copies of it to distribute, the next morning for another 100, and the same afternoon for another 100. Within a few days he had read through the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and he continued to come in to the office several times a week for books and booklets, with the result that he had obtained from this office within the space of one month the quantity of 470 bound books, 1,532 booklets, and 5 Bibles, all of winch he distributed free. One day he came in a taxi and took away several cartons of literature, which he distributed in the slaughterhouse, almost causing a riot and requiring police intervention to keep order. This man is very well known for his honesty and straight dealing, and in this way he will surely have given a strong witness to people whom it would otherwise have been extremely difficult to reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another striking case is that of a priest who came for some books. He had been expelled from the “church” for showing up a particularly wicked racket run by the clergy. A week later he returned to complete his set of books and seemed to be rejoicing in the truth, promising to come soon to our meeting. What was particularly remarkable was his strong appreciation of the Society’s calendar. It was heartier than that observed hitherto in anyone else. He was also delighted with the most telling cartoons in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. He too</span><span class="font4"> was a victim of the Hierarchy I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had two regional service meetings and one eon-vention; the latter attended by about 600 brethren from France, Holland and Belgium.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this land of darkness, due to the oppression of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy it is very difficult for the work to be carried on. The people are put in fear by the inquisitors. The following is extracted from the report of the resident servant of the Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the exception of two brethren, all the friends in Bulgaria are farm-hands and very simple people, who are so busy behind the plow that only in winter are they able to devote some time to the Kingdom service. During the season they must also work in the fields on Sunday. Bulgaria is therefore in need of workers who could organize the work, in order that the Jonadabs, who show themselves in increasing numbers, might be brought together, and that the groups be instructed in organized activity. Bulgarians anywhere who could enter that service should get in touch with the office in Berne, Switzerland.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In that part of the country recently seized by Hitler with the consent of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Mr. Chamberlain the work has not progressed so much, and hereafter, no doubt, will be fully retarded by Hitler’s henchmen. In that part of the country occupied by the Czechs there is greater interest in the proclamation of the Kingdom, and the people mourn as well as in other parts, and those of good will are taking courage when they learn of God’s kingdom and the provision for the people through it. From the Society’s local servant’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All those devoted to Jehovah appreciate more fully now the privilege of service, due to the increasing light of truth which Jehovah gives to his people through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font4"> so they have diligently carried Jehovah’s message to the people, that these might have an opportunity to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. This zeal was particularly manifest in the threemonth campaign, as God’s people realized the necessity of having all men informed about the difference between religion and Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special effort was made to having the young Jonadabs united in groups as soon as possible, in order to make them more fit as publishers. In this country there are Czech, Slovakian, German, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Rumanian companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conditions for the work are most favorable in the sections where the Czech language is spoken, because the Czechs are not so much under the influence of the Roman Hierarchy. That leaves them more at liberty to examine the message for themselves. We do not have much trouble there from the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the section where German is spoken, the friends have had to contend this year with ever-increasing difficulties, because, under the influence of the Henlein party (Nazi), many people have become bitterly opposed to the truth and do not listen at all or are very rude with the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles on &quot;Children” encouraged a number of the children of friends and Jonadabs to take an active part in the service from house to house, and it is to be seen from their experiences that they are very happy over the possibility of carrying the message of God’s kingdom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports of back calls are still incomplete. Certainly quite a number of back calls on people of good will have been made, but not reported. For the ensuing year we hope to get more correct information and thus be able to report a greater number of back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Good progress, as compared with 1937, has been made in sound activity. We have been able to get cheap phonographs for the friends, enabling many to buy one, and thus to spread the Kingdom message by means of records. Some of the publishers report of the joy they have in this means of proclamation. Thereby more stress is laid upon the message, and the people become more conscious of its importance than in what they have read from the testimony card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Work in the printery: At the beginning of the fiscal year the printery and the office were moved over to our new and better quarters. We could not do any printing for two months, but in spite of this the following literature was produced in the remaining ten months:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">278,500 booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">26,740 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">73,700 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">16,860 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">149,020 other printed matter</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and this in the following languages: Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian, Russian, Slovakian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past weeks Czechoslovakia has been in the limelight of universal interest. Hitler’s claim to all parts of Czechoslovakia inhabited chiefly by Germans created an immediate danger of war. But as the great European powers have come to an agreement at the expense of little Czechoslovakia, the disputed section will be ceded to Germany, and thus another three million of Germans will come under Nazi rule. The majority of the Kingdom publishers of Bohemia live in this Sudeten territory, so there will be a heavy loss to the work in Czechoslovakia. The Nazis will not delay suppressing the truth as soon as they take possession of this territory. Since Czechoslovakia is being left to the mercy of Germany by the politicians of the great European powers, it may be expected that the Nazis will try to force their will on Czechoslovakia in the domestic affairs of the land as a whole, in order to suppress free speech and the proclamation of the truth in this hitherto democratic and liberal country. The smaller nations are fast losing confidence in the great democracies and in the League, which betrayed Czechoslovakia. Goliath appears stronger than ever and continues to blaspheme the Highest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the instance of the Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, the Nazis, the persecution of God's people in Danzig continues with ever-increasing violence. The local servant’s report, amongst other things, contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though, all the year through, a considerable number of the Lord's faithful people have been confined in prisons, and the courts, in an effort to intimidate others, have </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">infli</span><span class="font4">cted ever more severe penalties, the result obtained is nearly equal to that of the previous year. If the number of single copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> (not including those for subscribers) is added to the number of distributed books and booklets, there is even an increase over the corresponding figures of the previous year. This means that from a smaller number of workers more has been spread in actual field service than in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This could be done only in the Lord’s strength, and, in fact, absolute confidence in the Lord and love for Jehovah and his ruling King Christ Jesus are required for the performance of this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special efforts have been made in the service periods, which account for the major part of the reported distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have managed to keep a comparatively good number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> on our lists, and this is an additional and regular witness. Many of the subscribers participate zealously in the proclamation, for which some of them have already been put in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The aged parents of the branch servant, who ‘ ‘ disappeared ’ ’ two years ago, the work of the Gestapo (Secret State Police of Germany), were also arrested and kept in protective arrest for more than six weeks, even though their case had been dismissed by the court. The sister was discharged because through grief and exhaustion she was at death’s door, and died as a result of the treatment accorded her by the police. It seemed advisable not to address the people present at her funeral, as is usually done, and it was good that we didn’t, because, shortly after, five people, fellow-lodgers in the house where the sister had lived and who had been present at the funeral, were summoned by the detective police and were forced to tell everything, who had spoken and what had been said. Only the two closest relatives had spoken a few words. One of them was the husband of the deceased sister and was called to answer for it, but was released. This shows how uneasy the police feel about the whole affair, the “disappearance” of the branch servant and now the death of his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The four children of other very steadfast parents were taken from them, it being declared a danger to the State for these children to be brought up by their parents in the faith of the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Inquisition spirit ever controls the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Gestapo make use generally of medieval methods in crossexaminations. But contrary to that of former times, when people were tortured openly, the Nazi authorities are anxious to hide their wicked deeds from the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even women and children are ill-treated, in order to obtain false evidence under pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of them, however, were able in the strength of the Lord to withstand all persecution, which even the enemy admitted in several press notices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was said in one of the newspaper reports: ‘ ‘ The declaration of the defendant culminated in the statement that she would remain a witness of Jehovah as long as she breathes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The judicial authorities have received a mighty witness through all these proceedings in court, and the witness readied a large part of the people through the often lengthy newspaper reports of these trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Petitions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two petitions were presented during the year to the League of Nations or its representative at Danzig. Thus the League was further informed of the increasing persecution carried on in an ever more brutal ma-nner in a territory which is under the special protection of the hypocritical League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the inactivity of the League makes it ever more apparent that it is really only a dead image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The American consul at Danzig intervened for the return of the confiscated property, but in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">General Remarks</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year now ending has been a time of continuous fighting. All who are in the struggle are always in danger of falling into the hands of the Nazi tormentors. In spite of this, however, the faithful ones have marched courageously onward, trusting in the Most High fdr support and knowing that the chief thing now is to stand for the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We often have evidence that many people appreciate the witness work done. It has been reported that detectives called at all homes in a certain street, immediately after a witness of Jehovah had visited the people there. All were asked if they had received forbidden literature. But the people of good will hid away what they had received, guarding it as a precious treasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How the police are pursuing the publishers' of the truth is revealed in the fact that after our last action a police-squad car drove through the territory just covered and those on the streets carrying portfolios were searched; but none of those whom they sought were found.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Although Fascism is rapidly increasing in France, up to the present time the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has gone forward. This is shown by the general result as stated in the report from the Central European office. The report made by the Society’s local servant at Paris contains, among other things, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been made evident as never before that God’s kingdom is the only hope. Friends and Jonadabs have given the best place in their hearts to this the sole hope and remedy. They are, above all, interested in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Thanks to the instructions received from the Lord through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> God’s people in France have been brought to realize their true relationship to Jehovah. We have studied the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles on “Organization” and, fully approving of them, the companies are looking forward to the new organization under Jehovah’s theocratic government. From nowhere have we heard of exception being taken to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on these points, and we are very thankful to Jehovah for this food as well as to those who have to do with preparing it for us. All companies, Polish as well as French, make </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">the main subject of their studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In times past there was a certain rivalry in the companies between the above-mentioned nationalities, but today all understand that the New Nation is born and that all members thereof form a great nation; so now the forces are harmoniously united to the glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year’s outstanding event was the three-month campaign, in April, May and June. The Memorial, which was a feast of joy as never before, gave this action a real start. With a better understanding of the situation, Jonadabs as well as the anointed were joyfully present at the Memorial, but while in the previous year the Jonadabs wept because they could not partake, they were now glad, understanding the matter. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">articles on “Memorial” and “His Flock” have been a thorough instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three pioneers covered the island of Corsica, distributing 27,000 books and booklets. They had to endure extraordinary hardship in the mountainous regions of this island, and often were in danger of their lives. They did Che work on bicycles, as it is hardly possible to meet the expense of a ear. An American pioneer sister is now working in Tunisia, and two pioneers will shortly leave for Algeria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The five large sound equipments we have are a wonderful means of spreading the message, and results are very gratifying. People come out on the street, or to the doors and windows, to listen, and it is very seldom that someone not satisfied tries to make trouble. Where the sound machines have passed, all know who Jehovah’s witnesses are and what their message is. The Hierarchy has lost much of her influence and is compelled to sing her harlot-song in the street that she be not entirely forgotten. Though “Church” and State are separated, the Hierarchy seeks to use her influence. She puts forth particular effort to increase the diseontentedness of the people, in order to prepare the way for Fascism. Jesuits are working their way into the labor organizations, bringing about discontent and strikes with demands of all kinds. This is daily reported in the newspapers, and such disorder has caused a fiftypercent rise in food prices, this making the people still more discontented, of course, and more inclined to accept radical measures as a solution. We are fighting this old “whore” and are thankful to Jehovah for the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> and other mighty weapons at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to depict the enthusiasm of the companies, the following is cited from one company’s report: “This year has been a year of blessings to us; for Jehovah has afforded an increase in our activity by granting us the three-month period and the favor of having a sound machine, and thus we are able to put in more hours of service than before. We greatly enjoy these privileges and are spurred on to sing with still greater zeal the praises of Jehovah, who is the fountain of all blessings.’’ The hours of field service for this company total 3,925, to compare with 2,506 in the previous year, and the increase in results is in accordance. A number of further gratifying reports are on hand from other companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Paris the Society has established a factory for making our own records, which will be cheaper, lighter in weight and more durable than the records heretofore used.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is probable that at no time in the darkest days of the world’s history has the witness work to the name of Jehovah God been carried forward under greater difficulties than it has in Germany during the past year. Due to the terrorism which is exercised by the Nazis it is not possible to obtain complete reports. Some of the faithful there, however, got reports to the outside, and this they did at great risk to their lives, and from these reports it appears that .they have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the total of 14,289. The brother obtaining this information adds the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, these figures do not express the perils and difficulties encountered in giving the witness. Back of these figures are testimonies given by faithful witnesses in the dungeons of the Gestapo and in the terrible concentration camps. For instance, Brother Wandres, who had attended the Paris convention in 1937, was arrested upon his return to Germany. In July, 1938, he was taken from his cell, in order to appear as a witness at a trial in Cologne. Before the assembled court he stated fearlessly: “Once before you have beaten me nearly to death. You have ill-treated me in a most cruel and brutal manner, but you will not get any information from me in regard to my brethren. Now do what you like with me.’’ With embarrassment the judge asked: “Who has done that to you here?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whereupon Brother Wandres answered: &quot;Not here, but the Gestapo at Berlin has done so.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another newspaper report gave this item: A judge asked one of Jehovah’s witnesses: &quot;What do you expect to do when you are released from prison, after your term is expired?&quot; The answer was: &quot;I shall again serve my God as heretofore.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother George Franzen was sentenced to two years and a half and a thousand marks’ fine. Later the Gestapo stated: &quot;The fellow still believes in his Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other newspapers stated that Jehovah’s witnesses, regardless of the most severe punishments, cannot be kept from serving their God and that they continue to refuse to &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; and do military service. As Jonathan observed David’s courage in standing up against Goliath, so the people of good will, particularly in Germany and in the European countries, observe how Jehovah’s witnesses maintain their faith in God under the most crucial circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though the boundary lines of Germany are carefully watched, in fact, about twenty miles along the border is carefully guarded, and in spite of the many spies inside the country, it is still possible to supply the brethren with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">which circulates from hand to hand and is earnestly read by the faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some unfaithful brethren betrayed others, and this renders the co-operation among the brethren more difficult. There are instances where men once brethren have delivered others up to the enemy and have testified against their brethren. One Gestapo official, named Naumann, caused the arrest of hundreds of brethren. It is said that he even traveled in Austria, posed as a brother, supplied literature and accepted contributions for Good Hopes. Another official went to Hofland, bought literature from a pioneer and later reported everything to the officials in Germany. Another German spy visited the Berne office, and tried to get information. She also tried the same in Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the reports of the friends and the newspapers we gather that about 872 were again imprisoned during the year. Nearly all are taken to a concentration camp, after their prison term has expired. In one case the Gestapo asked the brother, when he came out of prison: &quot;Do you still believe in the Bible and in your God ? ’ ’ The brother, answering in the affirmative, was immediately re-arrested and taken to a concentration camp near Weimar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to several newspaper reports, in the new concentration camp at Buchenwald and also at Dachau Jehovah’s witnesses have to undergo the so-called &quot;German baptism&quot;. Whoever says that he still believes in Jehovah is then immersed in a barrel filled with liquid manure. At Bochum a sister was robbed of her child, and four successive imprisonments caused a nervous breakdown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Karl Kirsch, at Bochum, was murdered by being beaten to death. The police at Bochum forbade the relatives to open the coffin and had sent policemen to supervise the funeral. However, the mother of this brother who is killed arrived one hour before time and asked the gravedigger to open the coffin, which he did. The mother and others recognized the person, who was terribly disfigured. His skull was broken, the nose was crushed, the lips were swollen and covered with blood. The natural sister of the murdered brother stated before a Gestapo official that she could not believe that her brother had committed suicide, as claimed, and God knew how his life was ended. Thereupon she was arrested and taken to a concentration camp. At the time of this funeral fifty brethren at Bochum were arrested and the cross-examinations lasted nine hours and were accompanied with most brutal beating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The wife of Brother X. visited her husband in the dungeon of the Gestapo at Cologne. The brother said to his wife: “I could tell no one what I have gone through here. ’ ’ At once the visit was interrupted, and no one knows where the brother has now been taken to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sister Y., who was arrested with two other brothers and who is still imprisoned, writes bravely: “The Lord is with us in all things, giving us strength as we suffer for his sake. I look up to him with confidence and full of courage, knowing that nothing can happen to me unless the Lord permits it. It is my only desire to always be pleasing to the Lord. Nothing else matters. May the Lord soon glorify his name, in order that all may know him, and until that time we will endure in faith and confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A number of brethren in Germany, at the occasion of the Memorial, sent a resolution to Brother Rutherford, expressing their close fellowship with him and with all the faithful ones upon the earth, promising to continue in the battle until the victory is won, and they stated that they feel united with all the faithful ones “as a city that is compact together”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Germany it is now compulsory to belong to some Nazi organization, if one desires to earn one’s livelihood. Others lose their positions and places of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are still some officials among the police who appear to be well disposed toward the brethren. In some cases they themselves have destroyed evidence which was collected against the friends, and in some cases the brethren were informed by the police that certain actions were planned by the Gestapo. As is stated in this report, all this material concerning the persecution of our brethren is now published in book form, and the newspapers in Central Europe continue to publish favorable comments about this book. The book also contains a report concerning the Gestapo agent Theiss at Dortmund, who publicly boasted that he had beaten up 150 witnesses. It is reported that he now bitterly seeks repentance for ever having started to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. He is said to be cursing himself and the day when he first began the persecution. He says that, when one was put down, others rose at once. He is now going about as a madman, visiting the brethren and asking his own victims what he should do to obtain peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the brethren in Germany reported that they heard the lectures from London, and while they did not all understand English, they rejoiced to hear the word “Jehovah” and the reference to “Germany”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is stated in the foregoing in a measure indicates what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies will do in England and America as soon as they gain control of these countries. The Catholic press continues to publish lies in order to hide their wieked deeds, and this they do because, as recorded in God’s prophecy, they say: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” In America people are kept in ignorance both of the truth and of the wicked deeds of the Hierarchy, so far as it is possible for the Hierarchy to prevent them from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Under great adversity the work in Hungary has been carried forward during the year. That country long under the domination of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy resorts to every possible means to prevent the people from being enlightened concerning God’s kingdom. The methods employed by the Hierarchy and allies against God’s people in Hungary during the year past are similar to the ones carried on during the days of the wicked Inquisition in former years in Spain and other countries. Says the report of the local servant of the Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The houses of many friends have been searched this year, including the office of the Society. False charges were constantly made by the enemy. Hungarian-made lies concerning Jehovah’s witnesses are being spread in all of central Europe. But just now, at the end of the year, many of these wrong accusations have been dropped. In trials held on September 12 and 14, sixty-eight friends were in court, and about seventy witnesses were called; but on this occasion the schemes of the enemy were defeated and the majority of the friends acquitted. Seventeen of them were fined 20 or 30 pengo, but on probation for three years. These fines were imposed because foreign Song Books had been found in their possession and because they had been passing them on to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends are often thrashed and abused by reckless fellows who are urged on to do it and often paid for it. We found out that in some places the local clergymen had rewarded each of these fellows with 10 kilograms [22 pounds] of tobacco, for having laid wrong charges against God’s children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present there is considerable lack of organization. Reports are very incomplete. Throughout the year only a very small number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> could be got into the hands of the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are some brethren in Hungary who are deter</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">ed to continue in the fight under any circumstances; and many people of good will, who are oppressed by a cruel gang of political religionists, are eager to learn the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To do organized, systematic work in witnessing to God’s kingdom in the land of Italy is an impossibility because there is the Devil’s religious headquarters and there is a Fascist dictator operating with the pope and able to suppress the truth. A few steadfast ones living in that land get a small amount of literature into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LUXEMBURG</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font5">Luxemburg, dominated by Catholic influence, is a place of darkness for that reason, and it is with great difficulty that the witness work to Jehovah’s name and kingdom is carried forward. The Society’s local representative reports, amongst other things, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are some Italian Jonadabs here who do not speak the language of this country, but are joyful in the truth, and these begin to join us in the witness work. Though they feel somewhat uneasy at first, their joy in the message urges them onward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are faithful in that land take advantage of their opportunities to make known the name of Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>THE NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Holland has increased during the year, even though beset by many difficulties. Says the report of the local servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new weapons with which the Lord has supplied us from his armory, especially the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Etches</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font4"> have had a telling effect on the people of good will as well as on the enemies. To the people of good will these were a help in making them quickly decide for Jehovah and his Kingdom. The equipment for the battle of Perazim has helped to increase the attendance at meetings as well as the number of publishers; and, to our great joy, much courage, zeal and gratitude for the blessed privilege of taking part in Jehovah’s “strange work’’ at this time has been manifested by the new publishers, and particularly by those in the land of the Philistines, or Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very appearance of many companies in this country has changed, and now Jehovah’s little ones at their meetings are found attentively following the studies, radiant with joy and thankful for the privilege of sitting at the Lord’s table. Much good has been accomplished through the instructions the Lord has given us in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article on “Children’’, and it has contributed to an increase in the number of publishers and attendance at the meetings. The Lord has young publishers in these days, children of ten years or even younger, who identify themselves as independent workers, doing service from house to house with gratifying results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The progress of the work is further manifest in the increased number of companies organized for service and in the coming forth of a goodly number of newly interested ones who are about to form new companies. Everywhere, and, to our joy, particularly in the land of the Philistines, the Gibeonites or people of good will are coming forth, joining the Greater Joshua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is surely a sign of progress and a pleasure to see that the value of the truth and the privilege of service are more fully realized, of which we have evidence in the fact that seven new Dutch friends have seen their privilege and have entered the pioneer service. A further number of publishers have also become aware of their privilege to enter the service as auxiliary publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Various quantities of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> have been confiscated, but no charges were instituted against us. Though this booklet contains the most trenchant message ever published, it is written in such a way that no law in this country has been violated. We have been informed that there will be no prosecution because of this booklet, and the confiscated copies, to the number of about 2,000, were returned. Thus the victory was ours, and it remains for the enemy to devise other schemes to -arouse prejudice against the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Holland. Foreigners do not have many rights in this land; they are considered as guests and, as such, must conduct themselves as the government prescribes. By order of the Department of Justice, which has a Catholic in charge, foreigners in The Netherlands are no longer allowed to go about with the literature of the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The conditions in Poland during the past year have been distressing beyond expression in words. The enemy has violently assaulted God’s people in its attempt to destroy all their liberty and privilege of serving Jehovah, and much of the Society’s literature has been suppressed at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Fascist combine. Says the report of the local servant of the Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Circulars containing a list of all tills suppressed literature were sent by the postal and railway administration to all offices under their management, with instructions to check carefully all shipments from or to witnesses of Jehovah, to confiscate any forbidden literature and institute criminal procedure against the consignor as well as the consignee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This made it nearly impossible for us to furnish literature to the pioneers at their posts on the battle front, since the shipments were not delivered and resulted only in lawsuits against us. We were compelled, therefore, to recall the pioneers and put them at the disposal of the companies, to assist in working their remote territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We experienced even more difficulty when, in the second half of the year, on March 22, 1938, all office, dispatch and storage rooms in the Lodz Bible house were put under seal, and still remain so. The Devil struck this blow while we were busy with the extensive preparations for the three-month campaign. Just as Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the country were ready to open the attack, all Catholic newspapers announced that Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland were now “done for”, their headquarters being under seal, their property confiscated, their association forbidden and dissolved, and their right to assemble withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As matters stand, it is really a miracle that we have been able to lift so high the standard of the truth and obtain such wonderful results in spite of the loss of the pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Especially interesting was the lawsuit with reference to the importation of. the German </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> For this the branch servant was sentenced to 14 months in prison by the lower court. That verdict was most dangerous to the work, because it indicted us as “blasphemers” and Communistic propagandists. This verdict was enough to make the witness work impossible. But the Lord directed the matter, and in a higher court the suit was handled by other judges, who looked closely into the case and listened with great interest to the witness given in court. Thereupon the public prosecutor himself asked that the sentence be considerably mitigated, because there was no evidence of a Communistic attitude or activity. He asked finally for probation. But the court rendered a verdict of “not guilty” and ordered the return of the confiscated copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tools of Satan, however, used their power of persuasion with the public prosecutor to appeal to a Superior Court, which he did. For lack of legal grounds, however, the appeal was based upon the canon law of the Boman Catholic Church, which is conclusive evidence that the appeal did not originate with the public prosecutor, but with the -secret councilors of the Catholic Church, and that the prosecutor only gave his signature. That is further proof that it is the Church of Satan, and not the secular arm, which is proceeding against Jehovah’s witnesses, and that the clergy makes use of the arm of the State as it did in the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From a remark made by a representative of the Ministry of the Interior, we see to what extent pressure upon the authorities is being exercised by the clergy. We told him that our appeal to the Superior Court of Administration would certainly lead to an annulment of the order to confiscate our literature, as was the case in 1932. He replied that in this case the Ministry of the Interior would introduce a bill canceling the court’s decision, which would mean that our activity would be stopped throughout the country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic Nazi combine in Rumania have brought all manner of cruel persecution upon the people of the Lord in that land during the year. The Society’s local servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The difficulties which we encountered in the year now ending are indescribable. One brother reports that on his premises the police searched the ground for four hours, using a large pointed iron rod, and finally found the literature buried there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends were compelled to hide their Bibles and literature in the ground, to protect it from confiscation. It is not yet possible to calculate the damage done to us by the unholy activity of the present clerical government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A strict censorship on all mail makes it impossible for us to give out information without bringing it immediately to the knowledge of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present the witness cannot go from house to house. Brethren doing it are immediately arrested and sentenced for spreading forbidden literature. All publications which are against the recognized religions are being suppressed and destroyed by order of the Ministry of Public Worship and Education. No one may print Biblical literature without the permission of the censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom of Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no liberty in Rumania. Whosoever dares worship God independently of the Ministry of Public Worship has to appear in court and is sentenced to from six months to two years in prison, as a first punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother who has just been released from prison told us that all prisons are overcrowded. There is scarcely room to lie on the floor, and they swarm with filth, lice and bugs. Watery soups are the only food given. Members of the various sects are there for having met together. Whole families have been sentenced to six months for that reason, and young mothers have had to leave their babies only a few weeks old. It is impossible to depict the inhuman activity of religious politicians in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy have their own detectives, who are paid by them and have to inform them of all the people are doing not in conformity with their religion. In a house opposite the Society’s office a flat has been rented for the lodging of detectives. Some weeks there are up to six men, and then again only women. They are disguised as workmen, peddlers, etc., and watch from their balcony what we do and who comes to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Government salaries for the clergy are equal to those of superior officers, and they have in addition a large income from christenings, burials and marriage ceremonies. Without the latter no marriage is valid in Rumania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1935 we entered proceedings against the Minister of Public Worship and Education, demanding that he cancel his decree which placed our Society among the forbidden religions and sects. He knew we were in the right and would win the suit, therefore he had the trial postponed three times. When he could not do it a fourth time, he issued a new decree against us, knowing that this would stop our le^al action, which was directed against the old decree. We also took action against this new measure, but the trial has been delayed for years, and when finally it was fixed for February, 1938, the clerical government at that time seized the power, suspending every law. A new decree was issued against us on June 14, 1938, and this stopped our legal action once more. On June 20 we took proceedings against the third decree and presented a memorandum to the king, stating our position, and that we should have the right of publishing Biblical literature and not be subjected to censorship, because the literature is educational and neither against the State nor the public order. We pointed to the fact that the Superior Court had formerly decided ten this effect, adding evidence of 70 acquittals. On July 14 the king passed this memorandum on to the Ministry of Public Worship, and on August 2 the office of the Society was put under seal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We always engage a capable lawyer; but where there is no law, a lawyer can do nothing. The whole country is under martial law, and anyone who dares to step up against the Minister is in danger of losing his position, his livelihood or his liberty.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Fascist-Papacy combine have their covetous and vicious eyes upon little Switzerland. That country up to the present has bravely stood out against them, however, and still freedom of worship exists in most of the cantons of that land and the work of Jehovah goes on. Says the report of the Society’s local servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As shown by the statistics, there is a healthy increase along every line of activity; in the distribution of books and booklets, in the total of hours spent in the service, the number of publishers, the number of phonographs in use and the number of listeners in the sound service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This, of course, indicates that the companies are in a good condition spiritually. They are willing to make sacrifices for the work, which is shown in the fact that during the year the 813 publishers in Switzerland spent 91,393.51 Swiss francs for literature and for service campaigns. The contributions received in return are hardly worth mentioning. Recent ordinances no longer permit us to even speak of a voluntary contribution; those doing so are liable to punishment under the peddler’s law, and heavy fines are being imposed. At present there are forty such cases pending in the courts of Switzerland. At a recent trial the Ihwyer read one page from the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cru-sade Against Christianity,</span><span class="font4"> to prove that people who expose themselves to such cruel persecution cannot be called peddlers. The respective brother was acquitted, and the judge awarded him an indemnity of 50 Swiss francs, imposing the law costs on the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is, however, increasing opposition to the witness work in Switzerland, particularly on the part of the Hierarchy. We have learned from various sources that in some Catholic cantons strenuous efforts are being made to prohibit our activity altogether, but it is only a small thing for the Lord to further maneuver the enemy in favor of the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We would like to point briefly to some truly Jesuitical actions against God’s faithful people in Switzerland. In the Catholic canton of Zug a public address on “Hope for the Nations’’ was held. Some in attendance seem to have been sent for the purpose of making a false report, and a charge was laid against the speaker for '' disturbance of religious peace ’ ’. The Superior Court, however, to which an appeal had been made, decided in our favor. Some newspapers reported in favor of the decision; others, very hatefully against it. It is quite certain that the clergy were infuriated over this defeat handed out to Catholic cantonal government, and that they gave out further instructions for action against the Lord’s people, for, when a pioneer later carried the message from house to house in this same canton, he was severely beaten by two businessmen, suSering a severe injury to his hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another instance: Borne members of the Bible House family worked a Catholic territory close to canton Berne. Upon order of the clergy, the police were sent and the brethren were arrested. Heavy fines were imposed by the authorities, wliich the publishers refused to pay, and were therefore forced to spend two days in the city prison at Berne. The jailers were astonished when they learned why the friends were there, and treated them kindly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another dastardly mean trick was the pasting of placards on billboards in a town in East Switzerland, reading: “Swiss people, rise up against Jehovah’s witnesses, born Bible Students, Wretched Dogsl” The instigators were, of course, too cowardly to sign their names. This action was shown up in an article appearing in the German </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> charging the guilt to Catholic Action, which they have never denied. We made a negative of this poster and have been showing it in our “Photo Drama”, which iB always well attended. This called forth much indignation and disgust from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another proof of intolerance and meanness was furnished on the occasion of a public address in Zurich on the subject “Crusade Against Christianity”. Young Catholics tried to break up the meeting by loudly interrupting. The people wEb were listening attentively protested against this disturbance, and the brethren ordered the rowdies out of the hall, carrying some out bodily, and turned them over to the police on duty. As was to be expected, the incident was misrepresented in a large number of Catholic newspapers, which, however, caused some liberal papers to report the matter correctly in their columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The deep affection of many people for the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is seen from a letter received in response to a public lecture, stating: “ ... In proportion as you suffer, we are being convinced that you are carrying on the most important work of our time. We admire your work, done in unselfishness and courageously out of love for the great Creator. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Statistics:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hours Books Booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> Sound Attendance 1938: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,743 2,919 31,722 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,945 10,484(1937: 5,500)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font5">Yugoslavia and her people are greatly oppressed by the rulers, and there the people mourn as in other parts of Central Europe. Under great difficulties has the witness work for the Kingdom been carried on during the fiscal year. The report from that country contains the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The organized attack of the enemy’s forces began in June, 1938, when (on June 28) the association was dissolved by decree of the president of the Drau-banate (province), which decree strictly forbade all activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in the land. From several companies literature was confiscated, and some brethren temporarily arrested. In connection with that attack we have interesting evidence in our hands, proving that the enemy’s efforts to destroy the people of Jehovah are well organized and that they move in concerted action. For instance, on the 10th of June, 18 days before the decree forbidding our activity was issued, all district authorities and local boards in the land were informed by wire of the decree and received instruction to arrest every one who took part in the activity and, if foreigners, they were to be expelled from the country and the literature confiscated. When the representative of the Society intervened in some cases, he was told: &quot;We have received our orders and cannot discuss the matter.” (We succeeded only in preventing the German pioneers from being sent back to Germany, which the authorities were determined to do. The pioneers must leave the country within 48 hours, and the representative of the Society had to guarantee this. There was still time to inform some others of the situation and thus prevent further arrests. Some officials told us: ‘‘This cannot go on; it must be stopped.” From this we knew that something was in the making, and on June 28 the decree was issued against us. But we were not at all surprised at these happenings and at the enemy’s attack and had been always prepared, thanks to the Lord’s instructions. Some brethren were fined and sentenced to 10 or 14 days, or to three weeks, in jail, doing time for the fine. One brother has been banished for five years from the district where he has lived, after being held in jail for three weeks. In nearly all of these cases it was made impossible to appeal to a higher court, as the brethren were held in prison until there was no time left for an appeal. We have not carried any cases into court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet was particularly grating on the sensitive ears of the clergy and has shocked their religious susceptibilities. They demanded, therefore, that the public prosecutor suppress this booklet, which was done by a decree of July 13, 1938. The motive for suppression of the booklet was given as follows: ‘‘It makes an attack upon all recognized religions, especially upon the Boman Catholic religion, and upon the legal organs of the State, the social order and also upon the international relations of this country, as represented in the League of Nations, and in such a manner that it can be regarded only as anarchistic propaganda, directed against the political and social order of the State.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The war that is being prosecuted by the Japanese against China has greatly retarded the witness work in China during the year. Reference is made to the comment concerning China in the 1938 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book </span><span class="font5">showing that the Catholic Hierarchy has gradually pushed itself on the Chinese for many years and now is vigorously supporting the Japanese in their prosecution of their war against the Chinese, and this has greatly hindered the spread of the Kingdom message. During a portion of the year there have been a few publishers in the land and they have placed literature with the people who have had a hearing ear. The number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the year is, to wit, 5,057. During the year the message went to the people by radio in English and also in Chinese. The English records were translated into Chinese and in both languages were broadcast. Three different stations from time to time broadcast the message. Many listeners requested literature, expressing appreciation. Religionists constantly sent in complaints against the stations. The German consul, a Nazi, of course, acting with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, threatened to ruin the business of Radio Station XQHB if the Watch Tower broadcasts were not discontinued. The station yielded to the threat. Four phonographs were used. Study meetings were conducted in English, Chinese and Russian amongst those who were interested. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine has a substantial number of subscribers and readers. Because of the great distress and adverse conditions the placement of books and booklets in China during the year has been small. This speaks very well in view of the fact that the English pioneers had returned to Australia and most of the work during the year was done by native Chinese.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE (Including Albania)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year the distribution of books and booklets in Greece and Albania, directed from Athens,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greece, totaled 55,889. Under great difficulty was. the work done, because of the violent opposition of the totalitarian government, aided and abetted by the religionists; and concerning this the local servant of the Society reports the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again and again the enemy tried to give the work of the Lord a fatal blow, but the Lord permitted him not to carry out his wicked purpose. Immediately at the beginning of the fiscal year the enemy, with great wrath, like a hurricane came to the office to seize all the books and, according to the words of the officer of the Secret Service for the Security of the State, ‘‘to put an end to this work once for all.” They seized all the books and booklets, and sealed them in two rooms, and they thought that everything was done. The Lord frustrated their purpose, and after a few days the books were returned to us, because the court decided favorably for this, and the work of the Lord continued. Since then the enemy has not ceased to do everything in Iris power to stop the work of the Lord. Twice the servant of the branch was summoned to the court, and a bishop, by a written evidence on oath, and two big religionists in person brought vicious and false testimony against the work of the Lord and His people. The bishop in his testimony said that “he knew well our work from America, where he spent </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font4">y years, and that he was convinced that it would be far better to serve to the people dishes containing microbes of cholera and plague than to give them these books, because the plague would destroy the bodies of men, but this pestiferous message destroys the national life of them”. One of the big religionists testified upon oath that “the purpose of these men is to overthrow the established order of things, and to destroy religion, family and fatherland with iron and fire”. The Lord put them to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again and again orders were, issued against the books from the different departments of the government, one of them ordering the police authorities not to take into consideration the favorable decisions of the courts. So everywhere the brethren are arrested and the books seized. At present there are 14 brethren deported to islands, one of them yesterday. We are told that they intended to deport many of us </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">en masse,</span><span class="font4"> but the Lord did not permit it until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we had 82 cases in the courts, involving 139 brethren. Of them we are pending, some of them at the Court of Appeals, 43 were for us, one of the Highest Court, and 16 against us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer work was back this year, • because one of the pioneers is deported for a year, and the other is in prison, his term ending in a few days. It is impossible for a pioneer to finish his territory without being arrested and the books seized. Added to this is the great poverty of the people and the fear of them to take books banned by the government. We also meet difficulties in sending literature to the brethren, because our literature is banned in the post offices; so we have to find other means. The Lord keeps this door open. The territories near the frontier are declared fortified, and so no work is permitted to be done there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding the many difficulties and the raging of the clergy and other religionists against the work of the Lord and his people, the Lord has blessed it, and many people of good will received consolation and hope. Lately we received one phonograph and some discs, and we shall use it as the Lord opens the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in that part of the earth, as in others, is causing many of good will to take the side of the Lord and his kingdom. More than thirty-seven thousand persons have heard the message, and many of them rejoice. The clergy have induced the dictator to put in operation new laws for the purpose of suppressing the work in that land, which laws, in substance, state the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books that are against the opinion of the holy Synod are forbidden to circulate. Exceptionally they may circulate under the following restrictions: (1) When they are sold in book stores, which must have on the front of them written the sect to which they (the books to be sold) belong; (2) on the front of the book must be printed the foreign sect to which belong the contents of it; (3) the said books must have the seal of the office of the metropolis in the jurisdiction of which the books are circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a month from the publishing of this law all the books that are in circulation must be brought to the office of the metropolis to be sealed. Any violation of the afore-mentioned law is punished with imprisonment up to six months, which cannot be redeemed, and a fine from 2 to 10,000 drachmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Printed matter, pamphlets, etc., in any manner offending the ruling church, family, or nation, are seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chiefs of all the foreign religions are obliged in a month from the publishing of the present law to make known to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Office of Religions their permanent abode, the moving from which is forbidden without permission of the minister of Religions. The offenders are punished with imprisonment up to six months, which cannot be redeemed, and with fines from 2 to 50,000 drachmas.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of the Hawaiian Islands are receiving the Kingdom message through the efforts put forth by the Society's local representative and company workers, which work is directed from Kingdom Hall, in Honolulu. The work is done chiefly in the English and Japanese languages, and during the year 24,283 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. In doing this, 5,330 hours have been employed in the field, by 18 publishers, and 8,108 persons have received the message in printed form, and, in addition to this, 15,713 have heard the message by means of electrical transcriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are five pioneer witnesses in the land actively engaged in the service. Says the report of the local servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the witnessing by pioneers was on the islands of Kauai and Hawaii. Both are mountainous, with a great deal of rain. At one place on Kauai the actual rainfall for the year was 590 inches. The pioneers work at great disadvantage, often climbing rough, rocky hillsides and having to stoop under low wet trees. The Lord’s blessing is on their work, and they report finding increased interest in Jehovah’s message. The pioneers on the island of Hawaii have just received a Number 4 sound equipment, so that an extended witness will be had there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is only one company organization in the islands, and this is at Honolulu. Total placements by company publishers for the year were 2,929 bound books and 7,208 booklets; 2,883 hours witnessing; 4,373 obtainers; 14,435 attendance at sound meetings. The average monthly number of publishers, 13. Many phonograph and study meetings were held, and many back calls made. No record for back calls was kept during the early part of the year, but 231 have been reported in the last few months. At Kingdom Hall meetings are held in English, Spanish and Japanese languages. Just this week another in a Filipino dialect is being started, &quot;for all nations shall come and worship before thee. ’ ’ (Rev. 15: 4) The studies in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">are greatly enjoyed, as the articles seem to grow more and more interesting and important. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> book is being studied for the second time with much relish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are 12 phonographs used house-to-house, and several more that are loaned out at intervals to interested ones. The back-call work is being pushed more as we learn its importance. There is much interest here, but the many different languages are a handicap in the follow-up work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new sound equipment provided has been in use since June, and greatly appreciated. In addition to the lectures in English played, excerpts from the literature in Tagalog, Visayan and Japanese languages have been read through the microphone. During the summer it has been used in the plantation districts, and from now on it will be used in the city. Recently, after hearing &quot;Warning&quot; on the sound machine a man insisted on contributing two dollars, saying he knew it was God’s work, and wanted to help. So now he receives </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two study groups on the island of Hawaii, one in Ilocano dialect, and one in Spanish. Of the first there are two who go out regularly witnessing, using a transcription machine to good purpose. They speak English only to a very limited extent, and witness mostly to Filipino-speaking people. In August a priest tried to stop the transcription lecture and finally sent for the police. After learning what they were doing and hearing some of the lecture, the officer contributed for some booklets and told the boys they were doing a good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the brethren had the great pleasure of two visits by Brother Rutherford and the party of brethren accompanying him, on his way to and from Australia. These visits and the message he brought were of great encouragement and stimulated all the publishers to increased activity. In April, due to the ship’s being delayed, the meeting was not held until 10: 30 at night, but Kingdom Hall was filled with people, many having waited since early afternoon. On returning in May Brother Rutherford delivered a public lecture, &quot;Warning,” which was advertised extensively by means of handbills, tire signs, window cards, and large auto signs and sound equipment. The newspapers ignored Brother Rutherford’s arrival on both occasions, and even the steamship company denied he was aboard the ship, demonstrating the deep hatred these people have for the Truth. But the &quot;Warning&quot; was given despite their attitude. Brother Rutherford also arranged for lectures on the islands of Kauai and Hawaii with good results, also a radio broadcast. Now the priests are warning their people against the literature, and te</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">llin</span><span class="font4">g them it is a mortal sin to even listen to the phonograph lectures. But the Lord will loosen the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of the year, all publishers in Hawaii join in giving thanks to Jehovah for the privilege of knowing and worshiping him, and for the many happy times enjoyed in the work. All desire to strive harder than ever, realizing the importance of the time that has been reached in the campaign for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s “strange work” is carried on in India from the Society’s office at Bombay, and includes India and Ceylon. Formerly Burma was included in that jurisdiction, but it is found more convenient to have that directed from Australia. Within the territory covered by the Indian office there has really been more literature distributed than the previous year. During the fiscal year literature was placed in the hands of 46,829 persons. The whole country of India is steeped in religious superstition. Those that are not religiously superstitious are the atheistic by reason of education. The message is reproduced in that land in English and some of the vernaculars by means of electrical transcriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the province of Travancore all interested in the truth are Indians and there are really more there devoted to God’s kingdom than in any other part of India. In that part of India as well as others the Fascist-Hierarchy combine attempts to rule the people and does so under the guise of religion. Says the report of the local servant of the Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The condition of the people is so poor that people in the West can hardly imagine it. The average daily wage is about six annas (15 cents). The result is that it is very difficult to recover much of the cost of printing vernacular literature and the work is carried on as a financial burden. The common people are mostly quite eager to listen to the message of the Kingdom, and even in places which are hotbeds of priestcraft it is usually possible to gather large audiences at public meetings. A report just to hand says that over 300 booklets and 23 bound books were placed at a public meeting at which some preachers tried to create a disturbance and dissuade the people from listening to the speaker. Thus it is that the enemy overreaches himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a house-car operated in the State by Indian pioneers. It is a veteran car which has seen years of service, but it continues to be a witness in itself as well as affording a means for spreading the message abroad through the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is published as a monthly magazine for the local friends in Malayalam and is much appreciated. They would appreciate it still more if it were published twice a month as is the English edition, but this does not appear to be practicable at present. By this means the interested ones are kept up to date with the more advanced studies the Lord is now giving to his people. There were 371 subscribers this year, as against 357 last year. Of these, 153 were registered as &quot;the Lord’s poor”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seven two-day conventions were arranged in different parts of the state during the year attended by 50 to 100 persons. On these occasions the friends were told about the organization methods for service and properly organized service campaigns held. The evenings were devoted to public meetings or studies in harmony with the latest instructions of Jehovah’s theocratic government now in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Punjab</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Away to the north in India is the British province of the Punjab. Here much work has been done in recent years by pioneers, and now the position is that there are hundreds of people of good will towards God learning the truth concerning the Kingdom. The missionaries hold many of the people in bondage by reason of land settlement schemes whereby the peasants cultivate lands leased to the missions by government. Theoretically the land becomes the peasant’s own property after a period of years, if he pays his rent regularly. Few are able to do this, because of crop failures, and the people become obligated to the missionaries. Those who then identify themselves with Jehovah’s kingdom are often made victims of harsh treatment. Children are denied admission to the schools (run by the missionaries on government grants), and in some cases the men have been turned off the land. A report just to hand states that eight men have been ejected from the lands they were cultivating by the Salvation Army because they had ceased to identify themselves with that religious organization and had joined themselves to Jehovah’s organization. The stalwart and fearless ones remain steadfast in spite of this sort of tiling and eke out a living the best they can, eagerly awaiting the establishment of the new order under Messiah’s reign. The fearful among the people fall into the enemy’s trap, and multitudes are being divided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four Indian pioneers, three auxiliaries and three company publishers have been regularly in the field during the year working under the supervision of a local zone servant. The field is vast and the laborers are few, very few, but so long as the Lord holds off the day of His vengeance more and more will come along as they grow in boldness and confidence in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Punjab there are sixteen towns or villages where regular meetings are held, attended by 166 people regularly, whilst there are hundreds more who are always ready to identify themselves with us when there is someone there to lead them, but who, for various reasons, lack that boldness when they stand alone. The problem of organizing a proper leadership for active service is being tackled so that the weaker ones may be strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The providing of vernacular literature for a country such as India is a major problem. It costs much money for the work required and it is difficult to recover much of the amount spent. Not only do we need vernacular literature for Indians in India, but there is a big demand from foreign branches to cater for Indians living abroad. During the year translations have been made and booklets printed in Malayalam, Urdu and Tamil to the number of 51,000. The booklets Cure and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> are now being prepared also. Shipments were made to foreign countries to the number of 2,200 bound books and 7,518 booklets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s local office at Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies, reports a placement in the hands of the people during the fiscal year of 65,646 books and booklets. The people in that country are very poor, at least those who give any heed to the teachings of the Bible. On the other side, those who are not so poor are arrogant and give no heed to things of God’s Word. The religionists have recently caused laws to be framed to prevent public lectures and free speech. The governor recently appointed was formerly governor of the Fiji Islands, where the publications of the Watch Tower have been prevented to enter the land. Fifty-three companies of Jehovah's witnesses are at work in the land of Jamaica. They are using 140 phonographs, 6 transcription machines and 4 sound cars, and are putting forth their best endeavors to make known the name of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Through the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Fascist combine Japan some time ago prohibited the importation of the Society’s literature to that country. Means, however, have been provided, by the Lord’s grace, to do printing and get the books in from another source. The result is that the distribution of the literature in Japan and Korea and Manchukuo totaled 19,219. This work has been done by 97 publishers, who worked 121,327 hours in the field, 111,523 persons receiving the Kingdom message in printed form. The war, together with the opposition from the religionists, has retarded the work in Japan. Members of the “great multitude” are appearing in that land, 27 of whom have been recently immersed, declaring themselves on the side of God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s “strange work” has progressed in Mexico during the fiscal year, and the total of placements of books and booklets in that land was 325,011. 309 publishers were in the field, employing 126,536 hours, and placed the literature in the hands of 133,229 persons. 126 phonographs have been in use, and 4 transcription machines, and the attendance at these meetings numbered 112,103. The subscriptions for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazines have increased during the year. Catholic Action is quite in evidence in Mexico, notwithstanding they wail so much about having no opportunity to operate in that land. Catholic priests' and other fanatics oppose the truth, warn the people not to hear it, and thus keep many in darkness. They enter not the Kingdom, and keep others out also who might enter. Catholic clergy stir up mobs, especially in the small towns and settlements, and by these intimidate the publishers. They seize their literature and burn it. The figures of placement in the hands of the people above given do not represent all the placements in Mexico, for the reason, some of the workers had not sent in their reports in time to get the information to this office for the annual report. The records of the Society’s office at Mexico City show that there have been sent out therefrom 34,807 bound books and 386,945 booklets. Jehovah’s witnesses from old Mexico met together with other Mexican brethren at a convention at San Antonio, Texas, and which convention was a great comfort and stimulus to the work amongst the Spanish-speaking people in both countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Under immediate direction of the Society’s branch office located in Copenhagen, Denmark, the witness work is directed throughout the countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland. As the year ends and the sting upon the Hierarchy has increased, that enemy of God and his kingdom is endeavoring to make more trouble for Jehovah’s witnesses in and about the Northern European office. It is reported on good authority that the program of the Hitler-Hierarchy combine was to seize Czechoslovakia and then immediately seize Denmark and to thus prevent England from landing any troops in the Baltic region, besides greatly limiting food supplies which come from Finland to England. That, together with the increased activities of the Hierarchy in and about Denmark, at present indicates the program was to stop Jehovah’s work in the Northern European office. This, we are sure, cannot be done until Jehovah has permitted it, and in the meantime the witness work progresses. The Nazi-Catholic combine have exercised their power over all the Baltic States and greatly interfered with the work of witnessing in that land, but they have been unable to stop it. If Jehovah’s witnesses were engaged in a selfish work they would be discouraged, but, knowing that they are engaged in God’s “strange work” and that he will protect it and have it progress until it is finished according to his will, they courageously go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the territory above mentioned during the year the witness work has progressed. The literature of the Society bearing the Kingdom message, that is, books and booklets, placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year totals 1,961,251, which is a decided increase over the distribution of the previous year. If there are added thereto the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> and magazines carrying the Kingdom message the total is brought up to 3,356,839. Thus it is seen that great numbers of persons have received the Kingdom message in that land, to the chagrin of the Hierarchy and to the joy of those who are seeking the way to life and everlasting blessings incident thereto. Those who have received the message during the year number 1,799,757, and thus it is observed that many hearts have been warmed and encouraged by the prospective blessings that God has in store for them that love him. Many of these are learning that “happy is that people whose God is Jehovah”. During the year there has been an increase of pioneer workers in the field and these pioneers alone have placed in the hands of the people 602,184 books and booklets. Added to this, the company workers and others of the Lord’s little army have made a decided move for righteousness within the territory mentioned. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which transmits the Kingdom message to those who love the Lord and strive to serve him, has greatly increased throughout that territory. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine has also increased in subscriptions amongst the people. In addition to the large subscription list throughout that country, single copies to the number of 295,322 have been placed in the hands of the people, every copy bearing the Kingdom message. The Society’s local branch servant directing the work from the Northern European office, in making his report to this office, among other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Month Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three-month period, April to June, was a specially blessed time, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> has done a great work in so clearly showing up the difference between religion and Christianity. I believe that booklet has been more discussed than any other. A student of theology writing in an Aarhus paper remarked: &quot;Recently Jehovah’s witnesses have spread a mass of books and booklets, and the latter have been diligently read. . . . Further it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Cure)</span><span class="font4"> gives the interesting but somewhat surprising information that Protestants and Jews fall upon the neck of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and thereafter wander arm in arm to ensnare men in the deception of religion. And page after page its burning attack on Church and clergy continues. No wonder this piece is so eagerly read.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Six Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the periods were wonderfully blessed; for during the 54 special days we had an average of 2,861 in the field and our placements were 968,990. This to compare with 2,704 in the field and 984,025 placed last year. A heat wave was responsible for a 50,000 decrease in the August period. In the three-month period, April, May and June, our placements were 1,067,796. We all realize that the Lord is graciously allowing us to see and understand that the prophecies are being fulfilled before our eyes and that &quot;the stranger&quot; &quot;from a far country for [Jehovah’s] great name’s sake’’ has come to &quot;this house’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gramophone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year only a slight beginning had been made with this wonderful weapon the Lord has prepared for us, because of the difficulty in getting both gramophones and records. This has now been overcome and we have 1,470 gramophones in Northern Europe as well as thousands of pressed records recorded in wax. Last year 231,181 lectures were given, to an audience of 374,082, and again and again the brethren experience what a wonderful help this instrument is, not only in placing the books, but in stirring up the people to read them after they are placed. This is emphasized in the reports from the various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These in the Lord’s providence have been a wonderful means of helping us to come in contact with the &quot;great multitude”. Whereas we previously merely sowed the seed, we now, in harmony with the stress laid thereon from headquarters, not only sow it, but go back and water it and tend it. In this way people of good will come forward and are helped into the chariot of the antitypical Jehu. Since May, when records began to be kept, 28,146 back calls have been made, which represent much hard work; for in this connection only such calls as increase the Kingdom interests can be deemed &quot;back calls”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Study Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eidhes</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> studies are held, and the newly interested are directed thereto. It is wonderful in these days how quickly they say, &quot;Can I not go out with this message from house to house and so help in this work?” Clearly the Lord is gathering the &quot;great multitude”, and as clearly he gives his consecrated a share in that glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These brethren, as heretofore, have proved a splendid link between the offices and the field, and as the Devil throws sand in the machinery of God’s organization they help dear it out, and so the work goes more smoothly as a result of their labors and of the encouragement given to the brethren. A helping hand is also extended to the &quot;great multitude” in the various meetings arranged for the benefit of these who are seeking the way to Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These gatherings for the study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and consideration of practical ways and means of increasing the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom interests have been much blessed of the Lord. They are conducive to unity in action, and on such occasions many of the &quot;great multitude” take part in the work for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At one such gathering recently I told them about the London convention, which I had the privilege of attending. All were rejoiced to hear about your meeting for the Jonadabs and of how they will be used of God to do that which Adam and Eve failed to do, viz., fill the earth with a race of perfect people in harmony with God and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year just ended we have enjoyed peace and prosperity in Scandinavia and Finland, but, as will be seen from the Danish report, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have taken umbrage at the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet. Well would it have been for them had they taken a warning therefrom. In the Baltic States there is generally trouble, but, all in all, it has been the busiest and happiest year of our lives in Northern Europe, wherefore we say, &quot;Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Appended hereto are items contained in the reports from the various countries named, to wit:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On the whole the witness work throughout Denmark has increased amidst difficulties. The number of workers in the field largely increased. The newly interested quickly enter the field service, rejoicing in their privilege of having a part as companions of the Lord’s anointed. Amongst other things the local report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet has made a deep impression on many who have read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The recorded discourses are a great help to those asking the way to Zion. Recently a sister in Copenhagen, who is not strong enough to carry the gramophone from door to door, related how successful she had been in back calls with the gramophone, which enabled her to have those who had obtained the books to really get down to reading them. She was much encouraged, and in the course of a dozen back calls she was able to place another 33 bound books. The possibilities of the gramophone, both in door-to-door work and in back calls, are very great; for the truth is presented both clearly and succinctly and people cannot very well interrupt, or discuss with, a gramophone. Last September we began sending out the light gramophones, which we make ourselves, as we cannot get an import license, and now we have 406 in use. In the year just ended there were run 35,598 lectures, heard by 42,355 people; surely a mighty witness to the truth. Last year there were only 2,191 lectures, heard by 4,861 people; so the increase is very gratifying. That we can now produce good records in Copenhagen is of great importance, not only to the work in Denmark, but in Scandinavia and Finland. When inquirers have had the literature and heard the recorded discourses they soon find their way to the Jonadab studies. During the year we had 732 such meetings, attended by 11,307, which naturally included some friends also. Thus in natural sequence the literature is placed, the interest aroused is deepened by further gramophone lectures, and these in turn by study meetings where questions propounded are dealt with. Then follows the service work for all who are rightly exercised, and often it begins at one or other of the service conventions held all over the country. This year we have had 20 such, attended by 3,307.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not all people appreciated the wonderful presentation in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> booklet in Denmark. Here there are some 26,000 Catholics and for the first time they have become vocal and presented a petition to the attorney general asking to proceed against us under the penal clause in the Blasphemy law. This pertains to defamation of lawful denominations, and action can be brought only by the attorney general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though they had opportunity to do so, the large papers in Copenhagen did not publish this news, but a paper called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kristeligt Dagblad</span><span class="font4"> (Christian Daily Paper), which is Protestant but hates the truth presented in our literature, came to the assistance of the Roman Catholics. Part of their statement under the caption of &quot;Record of Perfidious and Mendacious Assertions&quot; is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;In the Solicitor’s writ amongst other things is stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Just to give an example of the tone and methods adopted by the ‘ ‘ Watch Tower ’ ’ to fight all religion and .especially the Catholic, a copy of one of the Society’s booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font4"> is submitted. The Society’s other publications, the semi-monthly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vagttaamet</span><span class="font4"> and the monthly paper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden (Consolation), </span><span class="font4">which are advertised in every booklet, continually endeavor to establish a record for perfidious and mendacious assertions about, and charges against, the Catholic religion, its priesthood and other adherents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Behind the Christian mask, under which this anti-religious campaign is waged and which for a Christian community is inadmissible, it is impossible to find a positive or idealistic pursuit, but even if a certain ‘ ‘ good faith ’ ’ could be presumed, it must be considered absolutely necessary that the limits of permissible methods be established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘When I made this request to the Attorney General on behalf of my clients and fellow-believers as well as myself, it is, of course, in full recognition of the fact that the &quot;Watch Tower” Society’s and the American Judge Rutherford’s products do not mean more for well-informed people trained in logical thinking than the confused writings of a psychopath, but with the conviction, at the same time, that for people who from an intellectual standpoint are not so well equipped and who more than others have a claim to—and need for—the protection of the law, it might produce a terror-stricken state of mind, but, in any case, offense, wrath and shame from which they should be spared.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doubtless the Roman Catholics in their zeal for the protection of those of their number (26,000 out of Denmark’s 3,800,000) “not so well equipped’’ have overlooked the high cultural standard attained in this democratic, liberty-loving land, where conditions are so different from those obtaining in purely Roman Catholic and therefore illiterate countries like Italy and Spain. In any ease truth is easily appreciated. In Christ’s day the common people, “not so well equipped,’’ heard him gladly, while the learned, trained in “logical thinking’’, took Him and crucified </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font4">, Today conditions are unaltered when Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the truth. The common people hear gladly, while the learned are “grieved” because the people are taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In their zeal the Roman Catholics overran themselves, for they had an interview with a Pastor Borregaard of the State Church, who gave a very fair rfisumfi of our views, so that all </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kristeligt Dagblad’s</span><span class="font4"> readers had the truth presented to them and Psalm 2: 1-5 had f</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfillm</span><span class="font4">ent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pastor Borregaard’s Synopsis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“RUTHERFORD’S TEACHINGS: WHAT ABE T</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font2"> CHIEF POINTS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One can best explain the matter in the following way: Rutherford sees the history of the world as a fight between God and the Devil. The Devil wishes to be equal with God, and the fight between them will demonstrate who is the greater. In 1914 war broke out in heaven. Christ threw Lucifer down to earth, and this caused the World War. The activities of the Devil from that point of time are limited to the earth, but here, as a set-off, he exercises a terrible sway and gathers his forces in opposition to God. Politicians, capitalists and priests of all denominations are the Devil’s helpers. The League of Nations is one of his most important instruments—an ‘abomination of desolation’ on holy ground. The Christian churches are prisons for Satan’s organization. Darkness rules in them, and hypocrisy prevails. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attorney general is considering the matter at the moment, so we do not know what action, if any, he will take under the law in question.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work has been retarded in this part of the field during the year, due to the fact that a number of books and booklets were seized by the Nazi-Hierarchy authorities and confiscated. The order confiscating the books contained these words: “The books contain deprecating and belittling expressions concerning Catholic and other religions, which may cause enmity against them. They prophesy a flood and the approaching end of the world, and which may cause social anxiety among the less-educated people, and they use a sharp tone and express enmity against forms of government and governmental leaders of many countries.” The foregoing act of confiscation was done in the face of the Constitution of that land,' which guarantees liberty of worship, otherwise called “religious liberty”. The Catholic influence is increasing in that land. Says the local representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A leading priest is reported to have said, “that during the Czarist regime it was on sufferance that (Boman) Catholics could operate, but that since Estonia gained independence the situation had changed entirely. Opportunities became greater, because of the religious freedom provided for by the present Constitution. This religious tolerance was not left unnoticed by the Holy See. They began to use their power for the purpose of disseminating the Catholic faith in Estonia. And with results. ...” Answering the question as to whether the Estonian citizen is a suitable character acceptable to the Catholic religion, one of the “fathers” replied, “The Estonian forefathers were [Boman] Catholics, only later the Lutheran religion came.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in behalf of the Kingdom has advanced in Finland during the year, and great has been the joy of those who have participated in advertising God's kingdom. Says the local representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been a wonderful encouragement for us to see how the prophecies are being fulfilled before our eyes and how we have been privileged to have a part in fulfilling them. It is such a privilege that we do not And words to express our gratitude. But what had we known about these most precious Truths, if we had not read them from the Society’s publications, especially </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower!</span><span class="font4"> To read from the dear </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">about theocratic rule was indeed a solemn occasion. One could see how the Lord had taken again a great step toward the final settlement of affairs on this earth. Now the friends are free from the useless burden to try to ‘ ‘ direct ’ ’ God’s organization, and now every one can put the whole energy in doing what is told. Oh, that every human creature of good will would be a subscriber for this paper!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Equipment Work. This part of the work has even this year shown a considerable increase. Last year the friends had about 100 gramophones, and now over 300, viz., 309. The lectures have increased from 2,896 to 72,626; and the attendance, from 26,510 to 151,879. The work with transcription machines has been also very effective. There are a good lot of homes where they have been so suspicious that they have refused to listen to the gramophone lectures. What to do? Our brethren have succeeded to get permission from many houseowners to place the loudspeaker on the top of a smokepipe, and the voice has not only gone through the flues into the rooms but also it has gone through the air all around into the vicinity. In the hot days when it has been difficult to find people in their homes, the loudspeaker has been placed in a boat and by slowly rowing the people on the shore have had a good opportunity to listen to the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When I read before Jesus’ words, ‘What ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops,’ I could never dream that it would even literally be so fulfilled as the loudspeakers do it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The many-sided use of the transcription machines is a wonder in our eyes. It has opened possibilities, where all other means have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The International Periods have been during this year a very great encouragement for the friends, and especially the Period in connection with the Memorial was the most wonderful we yet have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Printing Plant. The work done in our printing plant has been a great help for us, and we are very grateful for the improvement you permitted us to do by buying a new setting machine, as it is saving the very precious time at the office and in many ways now helping us to do a more effective work. We have still an old little printing press without automatic feeding, binding a worker for a long time when big editions are in </span><span class="font4">question, and our hope is to see in due time also a new automatic press, which would save much time and greatly help us in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Watchtower” and “Consolation”. The work done by these papers cannot be overestimated, and to our joy we have seen them being more and more appreciated, and we only, long to have them into many more homes during the coming year. Although we at the time when we changed the name of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> also dropped the once-a-month edition, so that the paper now appears twice a month, yet the actual number of subscribers has well increased, showing how the subscribers appreciate the paper. We should like to see an improvement of the paper in order to get a greater circulation, but it is not possible before we get the above-mentioned new printing press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Enemies” and “Cure”. Never have books here got in such a short time such a big circulation as these both, especially </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font4"> of which we had an edition of 275,000. The witnessing work has taken such proportions that the end cannot be far away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our little Bethel family of 16 has had a very busy year, but anyhow they have been able to press out a little more time in the work from door to door, and so the results have even gone upward: books, from-1,449 to 2,195; booklets, from 18,226 to 22,318, and, all together with the papers, from 20,640 to 25,363.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions. We have found that conventions in connection with Periods have helped a good lot to encourage friends to use more energy during the time than they had else done, and so the most of the conventions have been arranged just in connection with the Periods. We have had together 68 conventions, with the total attendance of 3,847, and 66,161 books and booklets were spread, against 35,702 last year. Of the conventions, our year convention in Helsinki was, without question, the best we yet have had. Although planned months ago, it happened to be just at the same time as the great World Convention, and we had the joy to go out with the same booklet as our brethren all over the world. It was such a stimulus for the friends that we got a result far beyond what we had been able to dream of. When the convention was finished we found that 388 brethren had spread 17,316, which is an enormous increase compared with 3,609 the year before. During this convention we had also the joy to hear your wonderful lectures, and from our whole heart we joined in ayes and applauses. It was also interesting to hear you command that the disturbing woman should be carried out. It came to our minds how the Lord soon is giving his command about the everything-disturb-ing 'old lady’ and she shall be carried out into oblivion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the frozen and bleak country of Iceland one lone Kingdom witness works. He travels on boats along the coast, and inland by means of a packhorse. He carries his phonograph and his books. During the year he had 994 phonograph setups and 1,738 people listened with him. He placed 3,277 books. There is a great amount of superstition and spiritism amongst the people. Some of them have a keen desire to know about the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All the Society’s literature, in this land has been banned and confiscated except five booklets, and with these it has been difficult to work. New laws have been enacted in the land, which greatly proscribed any kind of witness work. Books imported can be placed only by licensed persons; and the reason for this may be ascertained when the following fact is noted: That the Foreign Minister, M. Munsters, made a visit to Rome to discuss with-the Hierarchy religious questions pertaining to this country. He is both a German Nazi and a Roman Catholic. In Rome he was in conference with Paeelli, who did some smooth work in America. He had the 'privilege’ of kissing the pope’s pedal extremity. Shortly after Munsters’ return from his visit to Vatican City, eight members of the government were invested by the pope with the Order of St. Sylvester. The dictator of this land had been decorated by the pope previous to that, and a short time thereafter the king of Italy conferred an honor on the dictator. Latvia was one of the first countries to recognize the conquest of Abyssinia. The trail of the Serpent is easily followed when the facts are duly considered.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Wherever the Roman Catholic Hierarchy influence predominates 'darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people’. (Isa. 60:2) Satan, the mimic god and who constantly mocks and reproaches Jehovah’s name, always manages to cloak himself and his agents in a garb pretending to represent the Lord Jesus Christ and at the same time holding the people in subjection that the Catholic religious crowd may be perpetuated. In Lithuania the importation of books is prohibited, and the assigned reason is that the language is poor. Even Bibles are not permitted to enter the country, on that score. It is freely admitted by officials in that land that the influence of Vatican City is so great that laws cannot be enacted for the benefit of the people. All registration of births, deaths and marriages now is in the hands of the Hierarchy clergy, and for this those racketeers receive a revenue of approximately $300,000. Until three years ago civil registration was permitted. The people attempt to have laws for their benefit, but they cannot do it. The result is that every child born automatically becomes a child of the Catholic organization and, when he grows up, he is compelled to indulge in religious practices to suit the Hierarchy. There are instances in which children have been knocked down for failing to answer religious questions, and the knocking has been by some ‘reverend’ gentlemen wearing a gown. In that land the Nazis and the Hierarchy work hand in glove. Amidst all this persecution the truth gets to some people and they take their stand on the side of the Lord, and this is a good result, when it is considered that 85-percent of the population is Roman Catholic. There is evidence in the land coming to the front that “Ammon” and “Moab” may soon act against “Mount Seir”. (2 Chronicles 20) The Lord’s dear sheep in that land are courageous. They love the Lord and are determined to serve him under most adverse circumstances. The brethren everywhere will remember before the throne of grace the dear ones there who have to work under such adverse conditions. The Lord will protect his own.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers in Norway travel through that mountainous country chiefly by means of bicycle, and many places they are compelled to leave their machine on the mountainside and climb high with the bag of books. Another means of transportation to do the field work is by motorboat. The local servant’s report concerning this says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have two motorboats, with two pioneers on each. They work in the fjords and islands. Only about 10 percent of the fjords have roads; so the people must be visited by boat. The coast is 1,836 miles long. When it storms, especially in autumn and winter, they very often have their “life in their hands’’. The boats have a few times driven aground, but Jehovah has watched the events and in a wonderful manner they got off without damage worth mentioning. One of the pioneers tells, there are only in one district 6,000 greater and smaller holms, and in only one farmers’ district 365 holms, and surely likewise many sunken holms or rocks, many of those not yet marked on the charts. In some districts the people are clergy- and preacher-ridden; so only few books can be spread. But still the pioneers have had many encouraging experiences. Some other places the people are not religious. One day two pioneers spread from the boat 21 books and 70 booklets. The priest warned from the pulpit and interspersed his speech with lies, but some listeners were intelligent enough, and wanted to scrutinize, so the pioneers spread 15 books more. The next day in another parish every family received books. The cashier of the canton got 2 books, and remarked that warning of the priest was the finest advertisement. The father-in-law of a former government’s church-minister received 4 books; he declared that everything in the world now was cheat and fallacy, but here is really something good, he said. He never went to church. In one place two preachers arrived with the steamer; they were awaited, and the people on the place met them on the quay and denied them to go on shore for preaching there. They had got enough of their fire-and-brinistone preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other interesting items of the report are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thb Light and Watchtower. Jehovah has truly opened the windows of heaven and given us abundance of rich food through the pages of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Our way is enlightened with a vision lor our work and our way before us. The articles “Unity in Action” and “Organization” are wonderful, and the loyal remnant has rejoiced together with the lovers of righteousness. Some years ago some of us did see that Jehovah’s organization is ruled by theoeratieal principles, and waited for such articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature Spread. Also m Norway the work has progressed. The publishers have spread 26,157 books and 333,475 booklets; in all 359,632. It is 81,637 more than last year. Of this are 1,034 books more. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation (Ny Verden)</span><span class="font4"> has 10,010 subscribers; 1,466 more than last year. When we are still not allowed to speak in the radio it is fine for us to have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden, </span><span class="font4">as are visiting many homes every month. Twenty companies are organized, for service, and, in all, 430 publishers. The average number in the witness work each week, 184. Fifty pioneers and auxiliaries have been out: eight more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonograph Work. About a year ago we started the phonograph work. We have had very many joyful experiences in this work. With the phonograph we get such people to listen as before would not stop and listen. The wonderful and phenomenal concentrated lectures on the records are going right into the minds, as a powerful ray of light, to joy for the righteous and to fright for the enemies. 126 phonographs are in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in that land progresses to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Mark, now, the contrast in the country that is unhindered by Roman Catholic priests and other instruments of darkness. In Sweden there are few Catholics and there is no interference with the Lord’s witness work, and those who hear it rejoice in their privileges. Concerning the work in that land the local servant reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Sweden and their companions have enjoyed the fullest freedom during the year to carry on their God-given work, without let or hindrance. Strange as this may seem to our brethren in other countries, at this late hour in the last days of Satanic rule, the reason therefor is understood when one recalls that there are only about 5,000 Boman Catholics among a population of over six millions. We are glad of the opportunities thus granted us, and at the same time remember our brethren who are smarting under the enemies’ cruel persecution, and praying to Almighty God that he may soon vindicate his own great name and those who have kept their integrity toward him. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publishers and Hours in the Work. I am happy to be able to report a decided increase both in number of publishers and number of hours worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peak of publishers was reached in the month of April, when not less than 1,427 went out to proclaim the message. Our previous highest record was 1,152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of hours spent in the door-to-door work, on back calls, etc., has been 164,957, as against 139,644 last year. The 15-hours-a-month mark has been set, and, for example, the friends at Stockholm were much encouraged when the monthly statistics for August showed an average of 21.5 hours for 80 publishers reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature Placed. Due to the fact that we have had two new bound books to offer, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font4"> and to the valuable service rendered by the phonographs, we have been able to place 6,889 more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hooks</span><span class="font4"> than last year, or 55,869 copies. The two new books and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> represent between them fully three-fourths of this number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of booklets we have placed 504,430, as against 469,586 in 1937. The bulk of them have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font4"> with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font4"> next. Total increase of books and booklets thus comes to 41,733.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the books and booklets we have placed a fairly good number of copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine, especially of the issue wherein the Jesuits’ false accusations against our brethren in Hungary, which were published also in the Swedish dailies, were shown up. In all, loose copies have been placed to the number 116,340, to compare with 71,124 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> that have been taken also shows a healthy increase. The new name has certainly had something to do with this, as both the friends and the public appreciate same very much. Also the seriousness of the times has made some people look for consolation who hitherto had no interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above-mentioned literature items were placed with a total of 537,955 obtainers; last year’s figure was 362,551.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonographs. The much-longed-for new weapon, records in the Swedish language, arrived in November, and so with December the phonograph work started. During the past ten months 107,077 lectures have been run, to 153,786 listeners. At the end of the year there are 628 phonographs in use, which means practically one to every second permit holder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have already had the privilege to report to you about some of the really grand experiences had with this new equipment for the warfare. Time does not now permit to relate much more, but I desire to mention one case: A pioneer sister who is deaf and dumb had hesitated to use the phonograph, because she was unable to hear how it reproduced. Finally, however, she could not withstand the urge from within her, created by all the happy experiences related in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and the desire to be obedient along this line also. So she got a phonograph, and now she is overjoyed because of it. She no longer needs to trouble because of her poor way of presenting the message, and the people are getting so eager to procure literature that they themselves are picking books out of her case when they have heard a record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The records in the Finnish language have also done a lot of good in the northeastern part of Sweden, where most of the population speak the Finnish language. Our Swedish pioneers working there have in bygone years been able to leave only very little literature among them. Occasionally we have “borrowed” a pioneer from Finland to do that territory, but there is enough to do in Finland, so this could not occur so often. Now two Swedish pioneers working among that population have been able to place a lot of literature, in some Tallages in every house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And not only the literally dumb ones or those handicapped by the language are appreciating the records; no, we all do so, and do miss the phonograph if for some reason we should have to go out without it as a companion. Surely the Lord fills our needs, and we are grateful to him, as well as to his organization on earth, whereby he makes these things available to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back Cails. From the phonographs the step to back calls is a short one. The records are like a bridge which creates connection between the witness and the party on whom the witness calls back, and the result is that (1) more literature is placed, (2) the literature already in the party’s possession as well as new books left will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">read,</span><span class="font4"> and better understood, and (3) the interested get it brought home to them that ‘this gospel must be preached’. Just before starting to write this report I had a letter from a brother relating a back-call experience which shows how quickly an interested person can be aroused to take part in the work to some extent. The brother called back the first time on a man who had subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and read it for some while. After running a record the brother asked him how he liked it, and when he replied that it was fine, the brother further asked: “Would you mind coming along with me and carrying my phonograph for me, while I visit the other farms here in this village?” The man agreed, and they started out. At the first house he went in and asked permission to set up the phonograph and had it all ready, before the brother even got in, and so they kept on for 4} hours. They had then run 23 records to 22 listeners. The “carrier” showed much boldness even at the homes of avowed religionists. Result in placement for the brother was 6 books, 5 booklets, 2 subscriptions and 3 loose copies. Both of them were very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since we started to count back calls, in April, there has been reported a total of 7,987 back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jonadabs. Our companions of the “great multitude” class are continuing to come forth and show themselves. At the Memorial there were now 149 more persons present than last year, although the number who partook of the emblems went down with 133. Total present at Memorial was 1,277; and partakers, 578. In that same period there were 1,321 who took part in the work. Ill have symbolized their consecration to do the will of Jehovah; last year there were 82 baptized. We have held 382 meetings especially for the benefit of the Jona-dabs, which have been attended by 6,287.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions. Sixteen service conventions have been held during the year, attended by 1,429. Our annual convention was held at Stockholm at the close of the three-month campaign, April-June. During the three days of that convention there were placed 10,646 pieces of literature. On the 11th of September a service convention was arranged at Vasteras, an industrial center with 34,000 inhabitants. 135 friends gathered there, and 128 went out at the same time with their brethren in London and other places, and they placed 2,855 copies. At another place 17 witnesses gathered and spread 604 copies. At that place one of our regional servants attended the gathering, and he reported that he had the privilege of listening in to your lectures both on the Saturday and the Sunday. He was staying at a hotel and was quite alone, but felt as if he had been present in London, and voiced his gratitude to our great heavenly Father for having been allowed to hear and understand every word. Personally I was at that time at the Helsingfors, Finland, annual convention, and there we also got some of your Saturday talk and all of the Sunday one. And it was a most inspiring time to the little company of about ten English-speaking brethren who had gathered around the loudspeaker at the office there. It is indeed true, as you there stated, that Jehovah’s faithful people have every reason to rejoice, and I feel sure that the inspiration thus given will spread abroad in the earth to all of them who could not attend any of those 50 conventions or listen in and their response will </span><span class="font4">certainly be such as to make “Jehovah’s battle” the greatest and most far-reaching witness yet given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regional Service. Four brothers have been active in this part of the work, visiting the companies as well as calling upon the many isolated ones. The latter certainly need to be instructed and advised as to the various service items, not only by reading the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and other communications, but by personal and verbal instruction and demonstration also. This was proved true in so many cases that we have made it a point to call upon these brethren and newly interested ones so far as at all possible, even if it has meant more extensive traveling for the regional servants. Often such a visit has meant the start in the witness work for the party called upon. The brothers serving as regional servants have traveled 96,140 miles and held 358 public lectures, attended by 18,334 persons, and 680 meetings for the friends, which have been attended by 11,634.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reorganization of the companies, and the zone-region system, is now being looked forward to with the confident expectation that it will mean more effective service to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. There has been a total of 67 brethren engaged in this branch of the service during the year, to compare with 58 last year. The average number reporting monthly, though, has been only 48, against 49 last year. Some of the older pioneers do need to rest now and again in order to keep themselves fit for the work and to stay in it; in a couple of cases accidents met with in the roads have hindered. There is still need and room for more pioneers, and the call for whole-time publishers is now again given, hoping that it may please the Lord to open the way for some to enter this most blessed branch of his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Office Staff. These brethren have enjoyed their privileges of service very much during the year, and an average number of 12 have been out in the field every month, spending 2,758 hours in the work, and placed 13,848 pieces of literature. These figures correspond with, respectively, 12, 2,266, and 10,384 in 1937.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The land of the Philippine Islands has been priest-ridden for many, many years, but since the message of God’s kingdom has been proclaimed there some have been enlightened and made to rejoice. The “strange work” of Jehovah has progressed in that part of the earth during the fiscal year. The placement of literature has increased 20 percent over the former year, the number of books and booklets aggregating 103,416, about 50 percent of which are the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font5"> The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> booklet brought the greatest joy to the workers and gladness to those who read and understood it. During the year the Kingdom message has been translated into four of the dialects, and this opens the way for a still increased witness work. The Society’s local servant, among other things in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls with the Phonograph</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our experiment in the new feature of field service, the back call with the phonograph, is certainly encouraging, not to say astonishing and interesting. In the majority of eases, the parties called upon become receptive to the Kingdom message; hence it opens the way to place more literature and even subscriptions for both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> The Lord is continually gathering his “other sheep”. The back call with the people of good will is usually rewarded, as the army of the Lord increases in strength; for many take their stand on Jehovah’s side. Although this new feature has just been recently introduced, the brethren are experiencing the favor of the Lord by being able to locate the “other sheep”. The following is an extract from a letter of a grateful brother: “Fatigued of body and bouyant of spirit, I believe last night was one of my happiest times. It’s Jehovah’s doing and it is wonderful in our eyes—and all praise and gratitude be to our God and Fling. I do not want to take your time, knowing you are a busy fellow, but can I refrain from expressing to you, who understand, the joyful bubbling of my heart? For who is the man who will fail to raise his voice in thanksgiving after a blessed day’s hard fight, a night back call with the phonograph and finding some people of good will!” Despite the lack of vernacular records, side by side with the placing of literature, the phonograph is bringing wonderful results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Except in isolated eases, the testimony work all over the islands has received His rich blessings. One of these incidents happened when a brother was arrested and brought before the judge through the initiative of the town president, accused of peddling without license and of propagating Communistic literature. Result of this ease is quite interesting and may be well understood by quoting an extract from the letter of said brother to thia office. The judge speaks to the brother: &quot;This is ordinary talking only, as if you are in my own house. The town president accuses you of violating the municipal ordinance, selling books, and of propagating Communistic literature. Is that true?” I said to him, &quot;Judge, my answer is this; will you please read my identification card?” The judge read it aloud and turned to the president, asking: &quot;Have you not read it?” (referring to the card), and then said, &quot;Study your case, president.” The president insisted that the brother is selling books, trying to produce witnesses. The judge, having obtained some of the books and read them, answered, ‘ ‘ He does not collect much. The money he gets is not even enough cost to print such nice-looking books.” After the brother’s reading to them Article UI of the Bill of Bights of the Philippine Constitution, the president seemed to have been embarrassed, gave up the case, and said in part, &quot;So that is your religion?

<p><span class="font5">The work in Portugal is greatly handicapped. Only two persons during the year have been able to do anything there. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, having had control for many centuries, has produced a degree of illiteracy amongst the people that is not exceeded by any other country on earth that claims civilization. In 1912 a revolt turned the monarchy ruled by the Hierarchy into a republic, but now the Hierarchy has subtly gained control, many Jesuits having got into office. The two brethren that have traveled through the country this year have done some good work in the rurals, having visited many of the provinces, and thus they have carried the message of the Kingdom into the darkest part of the land where the people knew nothing about the truth. The books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the year aggregate 6,804,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is another crown colony of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or British Empire, and the dictatorial acting governor has at the instance of the Hierarchy issued a decree forbidding the importation and possession of literature explaining the Bible as published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. A good supply of literature was already in the country, and therefore there have been placed amongst the people from this stock 19,439 pieces, amongst 16,458 persons. Although the Hierarchy desperately fights against the light of the Kingdom everywhere, the result is to cause the honest and sincere to turn their attention toward the Kingdom message and learn that this is the only hope for the salvation and blessing of the people.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah has made the issue plain that each person may have an opportunity to know the right way. It is the Satanic totalitarian rule against the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ. Every human creature must take the side of the one against the other. The greater mass of humanity will remain on the side of the Devil. A small number will hasten to put themselves on the side of Jehovah and his King. The proportion may be similar to that of the flood time, when only Noah and his family, eight persons in the aggregate, were on the side of Jehovah and were saved. Concerning the similar conditions that obtain at the present day immediately preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty, Jesus says: “And as it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the </span><span class="font5">day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.”—Luke 17:26-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mass of the people of the present time' concern themselves chiefly about eating, drinking and other like things relating to the satisfaction of their selfish desires. The value of everything in the world is measured by money. It is therefore considered by the world as very unwise to even say anything about the evil conditions in the earth which might hinder the carrying out of some commercial scheme of men. Politics, religion, the press.and the radio are all devoted to selfish gain. Truly it is the time when the love of money is the very root of evil. Seldom do we find anyone raising his voice in behalf of the promulgation of information that will be helpful to the moral and spiritual advancement of human creatures. These things are compelled to stand aside while selfish commerce goes forward. Truly this is the time foretold by God through his prophet, when the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people. (Isa. 60:2) Never was there less knowledge and understanding among the people about the Bible, which alone lights man’s pathway, showing him the right way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who is responsible for this great amount of ignorance concerning God and his provisions for man? Who has turned the people away from the paths of rectitude and into the way of darkness and holds them there? What human agency has taken the lead in the degradation of humankind and the steeping of them in ignorance, thus preventing them from knowing about God’s kingdom? Who today fights most desperately to prevent the people from learning that God’s kingdom is at hand and is their hope ? The true answer to these questions is this, to wit: The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the chief instrument of Satan that is used to blind men to the truth and lead them into destruction. It is reasonable to conclude that ninety percent of the people are in total ignorance of the terrible and wicked record made by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and particularly that record which relates to the cruel Inquisition, which Inquisition was carried on as an excuse to confiscate property of men to enrich the racketeers that operated the Catholic organization. The Hierarchy has seen to it that its own black record has been kept hidden from the present generation, and this without doubt has been done in order that it might stealthily grab what little is left of the rights of humankind. Even the encyclopedias that once published a full statement of the facts concerning the black record of Papacy have been so changed that now little is found in them about the nefarious work of that religio-politieal institution. The public press, public officials and the clergy together join in the slogan: “Let us be good neighbors; make no mention of any of the misdeeds of the past, because such may tend to stir up strife.” The result is that the people have been lulled into complete ignorance of the facts and, while they are in that state of darkness, the Devil uses more effectually than ever the Hierarchy to grab control of and regiment the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is there any religious denomination in the land today that boldly proclaims the kingdom of God under Christ, advising the people that the Kingdom is at hand and that such is the hope of the nations? What has become of the once active “Protestants” who attempted to hold forth the truth of God’s kingdom? They are no more in evidence. Satan has ensnared them all, and on they go in blindness, giving no heed to what is just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is one little band of men and women on earth who firmly and uncompromisingly stand for God and his kingdom under Christ and who with boldness advertise the Kingdom. That company is made up of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. Having learned of God and his kingdom, and having devoted themselves to that kingdom under Christ, they are diligent to increase their own knowledge and to bring the message of truth to others. They stand out clearly on the side of God and Christ his King. They see and appreciate their great privilege of making known the Kingdom, that others might find refuge and safety. They know that the Kingdom is the only hope of mankind and is God’s means to vindicate his name. The remnant and the Jonadabs, the “other sheep” of the Lord, march on together, lifting high the banner of God’s kingdom, and their joy is ever increasing. People of good will seeing the activities, the zeal and devotion of these faithful ones to God and his kingdom, and the great contrast between them and the religious institutions, backed up by politicians and traffickers, these people of good will learn the way to truth and hasten to avail themselves of the opportunity to find refuge in God’s organization. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions has progressed with each year. One year ago the books containing the Kingdom message in seventy-odd languages had been placed in the hands of the people to the total number of 252,252,174 volumes. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1938, 26,772,882 more books containing the message have been placed in the hands of the people, so that now the total number placed in the hands of the people during the past seventeen years is, to wit, 279,025,056. In addition to the printed message the total number of phonographs and sound machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">daily preaching the Kingdom message to the people by electrical transcription is 32,410. Magazines and other means of advertising the Kingdom are in use, and daily thousands of witnesses are calling at the homes of the people to inform them of the impending disaster that Armageddon soon will bring and of the only place of refuge and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The educational work is progressing. Some are learning of the truth and are hurrying to the place of safety. All the facts indicate that soon God’s “strange work” will come to an end and then quickly will follow his “strange act”. What will be the result? It will be like Noah’s day, only upon a far greater scale of devastation. Jesus says it will be ‘great tribulation such as never before was known’. That will be the final trouble. Jehovah, by his prophet, says of that time, there will be so many dead that there will not be sufficient to bury them. It will mean the clearing of all wickedness out of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The storm past, the survivors that remain and form the “great multitude” will enter upon the grand and glorious work of fulfilling the divine mandate to multiply and replenish the earth with a righteous race. These truths now made known greatly enthuse those who love righteousness. They go forward to the work that God has committed into their hands, and nothing will stop them until Jehovah says it is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of the fiscal year’s work fills God’s people with great joy. His name shall receive all the praise and honor. Let us gird up our loins and proceed, trusting fully in Jehovah God, and continue to do with our might what our hands find to do.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>ELECTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The corporation, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, pursuant to its charter and by-laws, and the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, held its annual meeting at Pittsburgh, North Side, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on the first day of October, A.D. 1938, at which annual meeting a Board of Directors was elected as follows, to wit: J. F. Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Amburgh, H. H. Riemer, T. J. Sullivan, Wm. P. Heath, Jr., and Grant Suiter, to hold office for a period of three years, or until their successors are duly elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At said annual meeting the following officers of said Corporation were also elected, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President, J. F. Rutherford, Vice-President, C. A. Wise, Secretary-Treasurer, W. E. Van Amburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was ordered that the President’s Annual Report be printed in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font9">Year Text for 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;But they shall not prevail against thee.” —Jeremiah 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font7">N THEMSELVES Jehovah’s witnesses have no strength. They cannot look for or expect any real help from an earthly source. As the psalmist says, so say they: “My help cometh from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 121: 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah’s witnesses are not “brave”, for the reason, the brave man relies upon his own strength. Nowhere in the Scriptures are Jehovah’s anointed commanded to be brave. Jehovah’s witnesses are courageous, because they rely upon the strength and power that is backing them up, namely, Jehovah by and through his King. Their courage is according to their faith in the Lord, and, being strong in faith, they trust Jehovah implicitly and rely upon him, and for that reason are very courageous. Jehovah commands his servants to be very courageous. “Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed : for the Lord thy God is with thee. . . . Only be thou strong and very courageous.” (Josh. 1: 7, 9) In every instance where Jehovah sends his servants to perform a duty in honor to his name he commands them to be courageous.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font7">Jehovah’s “strange work” is now progressing and must be finished before his “strange act” takes place. His witnesses are engaged in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">197</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“strange work”. They are confronted with the situation fraught with great danger. They behold the murderous crowd, directed by the Devil, marching against them, and yet they are not dismayed. They are certain of complete deliverance if they continue to be very courageous. Satan has gathered his host to Armageddon. The visible division thereof is made up of religionists, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and with the radical politicians and conscienceless traffickers. Such combine is against God. and his kingdom. That enemy is bent on the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses, but they will fail, because Jehovah has given his word that he will fight the battle for his people; and therefore he says to his own: “The battle is not yours, but God’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being courageous, Jehovah’s witnesses and companions take the offensive and boldly march out to meet the enemy. The great climax draws near. Facing this mighty host of the enemy, Jehovah’s witnesses must be bold in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and must not omit any part thereof, and they must do so without fear. Unless Jehovah through Christ Jesus prevents the enemy from so doing they would completely crush Jehovah’s witnesses. God will prevent such a disaster. Therefore Jehovah says to the singers of his praise now on the earth who are facing the combined enemy: “They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” These words from Jehovah will be of great strength to his people throughout the remaining days of the conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having this full assurance from the Most High, let every consecrated one be diligent now to do his or her full duty. Doing so, deliverance from the enemy is certain. Victory is near! Let the high praises of Jehovah and his King continue to be sounded by all who love and serve the Most High and his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Ye </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence. —Isa. 62:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot maintain our integrity by remaining silent. It is our bounden duty to go to the people with God’s revealed message of truth, declare it fearlessly and boldly, and thus perform our commission to root out of their hiding places the buck-nuns and other visible tools of Satan, to pull down and throw down the most gigantic and fraudulent system that has ever afflicted the people and reproached God’s name, and at the same time to lift up for the people the standard of Jehovah and his King and thus participate in planting and building the kingdom of God under Christ, which shall completely and for ever vindicate the name of the Most High. It is the last time. Will you perform your duty by joyfully obeying the imperative mandate of the Almighty God? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it.—Jonah 3:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The kingdom has always been opposed by Satan and his earthly ruling class. Therefore when the Lord’s witnesses go forth to preach the kingdom of God and of Christ, the issue involved necessarily is political, because it announces the kingdom which will destroy all of Satan’s power, including modem Nineveh. Nineveh was a great city, capable of holding a great multitude; hence its fall would mean an enormous loss of life. Did that fact stir Jonah to be merciful as God was toward Jonah? Jonah was to go there and tell, not his own message, but the message of Jehovah. God had not cast Jonah away. In view of Jonah’s prayer Jehovah would now mercifully tender to him the privilege of again engaging in his service. He should show mercy to others, exhibit the zeal peculiar to those who joyfully obey the Lord, and regard all things as working for his good, and not complain. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.—Ex. 9:16, Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two things thus shown, that God purposes to do, (1) cause his name to be proclaimed throughout the earth; and (2) then show his supreme power against the enemy. Jehovah’s name, placed where it properly belongs in the hearts of his creatures, vindicated and magnified above everything, is of greatest importance. By the rebellion of Lucifer, now Satan, and by the wicked challenge he flung in Jehovah’s face that He could not put men on earth who would remain true and faithful to God, the name of the Most High was put at issue, greatly reproached and defamed. The question of supremacy thus put at issue must be settled in the right way. Jehovah declared his purpose to raise up a Seed that in due time would destroy Satan and vindicate his own great name.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God of Israel . . . spake by the hand of his servant Jonah.—2 Ki. 14:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Jonah” means “dove”. The name’s being given to him by Jehovah of itself proves it is significant. Jesus referred to himself as “greater than Jonah”. At his baptism the holy spirit, dove-like, descended upon him when God acknowledged him as His beloved Son. In symbolic phrase Jesus’ eyes are said to be “as the eyes of doves”. When his church is gathered unto him, Christ Jesus speaks of her as “my dove”. (Canticles 5:12; 6: 9) He directed his disciples to be “harmless as doves”. (Matt. 10:16) Jonah was the son of Amittai; which name means “truthful”. Christ Jesus and his church are the sons of Him that is “holy and true”. Jehovah is the Father of Christ and his church. Therefore Jonah, at some time, pictured the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, particularly the remnant now on the earth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring.—John 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First he gathers the small company whom the Lord himself designates as the “little flock”. It is such of the little flock that are associated with Christ Jesus in the kingdom service and in his royal house. Then Jesus gathers unto himself another company, which he designates his “other sheep”, or “great multitude”, and which multitude serve before the throne. (Rev. 7:15) The “flittle flock” are changed in the “first resurrection” from human to spirit creatures and abide for ever in heaven with Christ Jesus. The great multitude find their lasting abode on the earth. The little flock is spiritual and one group; the great multitude is of another group. Ultimately, when Christ Jesus’ gathering work is completed, all the gathered ones “become one flock”, under leadership of one great Shepherd, Jesus.—W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Mie. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah announces his fixed rules, which his creatures who please him must obey. The servant of God, therefore, must do justly, love mercy, and show mercy to others, and must walk obediently with God, that is, according to the rules which he has made known. Those who ultimately receive the Lord’s approval are diligent to learn the meaning of the rule above announced and then to faithfully obey the same. Justice requires one to act without partiality. Mercy requires the servant to rejoice when the erring one repents and puts forth an effort to do God’s will. To walk humbly requires one to be diligent in learning God’s way of dealing with his creatures, and then to be diligently endeavoring at all times to do likewise and to be guided in all things by the will of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the holy spirit also beareth ivitness to us. —Heb. 10:15, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah clothed Jesus with full power and authority to gather the ‘Tittle flock”, and later his “other sheep”. A short time after Jesus’ exaltation, and while the disciples were waiting for fulfillment of his promise that he would pray Jehovah, who would send them another comforter, there came the power of God’s spirit upon them. It was then and there that “the spirit itself” began to bear witness. (Rom. 8:16) The manifestation and operation of the holy spirit in, upon, about and through the faithful disciples, and for them, was the way the spirit bore witness of their being the sons of God and heirs together with Christ Jesus. God had sent them the “helper” and “comforter”, as Jesus promised, and the “witness” was beginning to be given them and thereafter came upon all called to share in his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.—Matt. 19:14, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Plainly Jesus’ meaning is that the kingdom is for those who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seek him</span><span class="font5"> and that it is necessary to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seek him </span><span class="font5">with full and complete confidence in order to receive the blessings of the kingdom. He did not say that those who enter into the kingdom must become children, but that they must seek him and serve him with full and complete confidence, even as a child looks upon and accepts one it loves. Jesus did not state that a Sunday school should be set up, nor did he instruct his disciples or others to form separate class studies for the children. ‘He laid his hand upon them, and blessed them.’ He did not say: “The kingdom of heaven is for little children”; but he did say that it is for those </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">who come unto him.</span><span class="font5"> Thus the Lord showed his purpose to bless all who diligently and confidently seek and obey him. —Heb. 11: 6. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of my Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah hath anointed me ... to proclaim . . . the day of avenging of our God.—Isa. 61:1,2, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That divine commission implies action on the part of those receiving it. Since the commission applies to all members of Christ’s body, it means full and complete unity of such in action. Jehovah is the God of order, righteousness and harmony, and every creature that remains in his organization must be orderly, righteous, and work harmoniously with the Lord’s organization and under Christ’s command. The importance of this very hour to the anointed and their duties as God’s covenant people cannot be overstated. His purpose long ago expressed has reached a climax and his creatures that now have to do with his work stand in the place of greatest responsibility ever upon creatures on earth. God’s anointed have been chosen by him and brought into the temple, and the blessedness of such adds to their responsibility. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.—Rev. 14:</span><span class="font5">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is in charge of Zion. Every member of it must be in complete harmony with him and joyfully obedient to his co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ands. Hence no member has any right or privilege to take a separate course according to his own ideas. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s chief representative and vindicator, and over and above all the organization is Jehovah the Most High. Every one of the organization looks not to a selfish interest, but to the general interest or welfare of the organization. To the remnant thereof now on earth is committed much, and much more is demanded of them. For these to move forward in the war the Lord provides information for 'their aid and comfort and specifically directs them in the right way to go. Among his people under Christ there can be no division, but all must stand shoulder to shoulder as one compact body, joyfully rendering their offerings unto Him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.—2 Chron. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persecution and assaults upon God’s covenant people drew them closer together in the organization at his temple. As with the typical Israelites, they came to God’s organization to seek his face. From all over the world the groups of his people saw clearly their duties and obligations to Jehovah and his King, from 1929 onward. They identified themselves as a part of Jehovah’s organization, and organized into companies for systematic field service, working together in unity. They became a people separate and distinct from all professed Christians. Jehovah’s witnesses then willingly, with keen appreciation of the need for so doing, came from different parts, leaving their comfortable homes, and joined each other in field witness work, having in mind their great privilege of participating in vindicating Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of bronze I will bring in gold; . . . and I will appoint the oversight of thee to prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 60:17, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophecy clearly indicates a change for the better, in this, as gold is better than bronze, silver better than iron, bronze better than wood, iron better than stone, even so by comparison and contrast a better condition is brought about. Prosperity must be accompanied by peace and harmony. The prophecy, therefore, must mean that those assigned to serve in the companies or organizations are committed to peace and that they pray for it and work for it and maintain it. (Psalm 122) It is made certain that those in line for the kingdom who do not strive to maintain peace and to work in harmony to the advancement of the kingdom interest, the Lord’s angels will gather out and cast into darkness. It is no time for controversies or strife in his organization. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then upon Jahaziel, ... a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation.—2 Chron. 20:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Jahaziel&quot; means “beheld of God&quot;, that is, those who are righteous in the sight of God. Jahaziel therefore pictured the Lord’s sheep gathered at the temple, who are approved by the great Judge, Christ Jesus, and are clothed with the robe of righteousness, and who then proceed to offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness. Jahaziel was a Levite, hence one who is “joined” to the Lord. The message through him would be a message from Jehovah to his temple people, and from him who is present with the temple, Christ Jesus. This Levite was a son of Asaph, which name means “collector” or “assembler”, as when the Lord gathers together first his remnant of the 'Tittle flock”, and then later his “other sheep”, and brings them to the feast of ingathering. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It appears to many that Jehovah’s witnesses are in the camp of the anti-God crowd, and they are accused of being in that crowd because against religion, which dishonors God’s holy name. Jehovah’s witnesses have nothing in common with the Communists or any other organization among men. They are against religion because they are for Jehovah and they know that religion dishonors and reproaches his holy name. The campaign of Jehovah’s witnesses against religion is not carried on to aid the anti-God people, but they are engaged solely in declaring the truth of God’s Word, as set forth in the Bible, in order that people of good will may be informed and that the stumbling-stones may be removed.

<p><span class="font5">God’s people under command and leadership of Christ Jesus, supported by his host of militant angels, march out to face the enemy. These faithful servants trust Jehovah and his great military Leader. They know that victory is certain because the battle is God’s, and therefore they cannot keep back the song, because they have been commanded to be witnesses to Jehovah’s name. To all the world of unbelievers the action, message and songs of Jehovah’s witnesses, the modern-day Judeans, seem very strange. The carrying of that message from door to door and telling the people and singing Jehovah’s praises, to all except the faithful ones appears to be a very strange work. It is Jehovah’s work. It is indeed a “strange work”. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The monstrosity, the giant Goliath, pictured a totalitarian state, which places the state above Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and commands all people to be subject to the “state”, in defiance of Jehovah. As David, the anointed king, came to the war camp, so now the Greater David, Christ Jesus, has come to the war camp and gathered together his faithful ones, and these, by God’s grace and power, are clothed with the spirit and the robe of righteousness. These are in fulfillment of the picture made by David, and they answer the defiance of the monstrous giant. They fear not the giant, but do fear God and Christ and are determined to serve Jehovah and his King. In their Proclamation of 1922 all political states were challenged to show cause why they should continue opposing God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has committed into the hand of Christ Jesus the execution of his purpose. This must include the execution of the divine mandate to “fill the earth”, that is, to have complete supervision over the part performed by human creatures. Therefore Christ Jesus has supervision over all things as the official representative of his Father. Lucifer was overlord of the earth until he rebelled against Jehovah and lost everything pertaining to righteousness. Christ Jesus is now the Lord over the earth, including those who shall live on the earth for ever. He shall minister life to them by the authority given to him by Jehovah. The reign of Christ Jesus is and ever will be righteous. The divine mandate given first to perfect Adam shall be carried out in righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">When the battle was on with the enemy, there was no backing down by Jonathan, but he fought the enemy to a standstill. His faithfulness in war against the enemy was acknowledged by David later, when Jonathan was dead and David composed “The Song of the Bow”. Even while Jonathan was under the jurisdiction of Saul he was always true to David. These facts argue that under the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are many persons of good will that in due time will be identified as on the side of the Lord God and his King, and that many of such are now watching the course of Jehovah's witnesses and the persecution heaped upon them by the Saul class, and are rendering aid to the David class. Those of the present-day Jonathan class must be true and valiant warriors, fighting along in the same cause with the David class, and fighting against the common enemy, modem Philistines. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/38</span></p>

The “world” consists of the heavens, invisible to human eyes, and the earth, visible to human eyes. Everything in that righteous world must be righteous and do what is right to the praise of Jehovah. The new heavens consist of Christ Jesus, the Head and Lord thereof, together with the members of his royal house, and also the angels of heaven, all being righteous and fully loyal to God and faithful in their devotion to him. The new earth will consist of righteous men who in times of old proved their integrity to God and whom the Lord shall “make princes in all the earth”, which princes shall rule in righteousness under direction of the righteous Lord; and also of the human creatures known as the “great multitude”, their offspring and others made righteous.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Boi redeemed with corruptible things, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ.—1 Pet. 1:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For God to permit Jesus to redeem Adam and to put him on trial for life would mean to give Adam a second chance; in either instance God would be denying the justice of his own act in sentencing Adam to death. God does not change. As to Adam's offspring, all were born imperfect, sinners. Such condition came upon them without their knowledge or consent. They were bom under condemnation. In bondage because of inherited sin, they had no possible way of helping themselves and relieving themselves of that disability. Shortly each individual must go into destruction. They were subject, however, to be redeemed by another, if God should make such provision. God has made all necessary provision for redemption and has fixed the rules to be met by each to be relieved from sin’s bondage and have opportunity for salvation.

Jehovah God is the supreme power, and he and Christ Jesus together constitute the “Higher Powers”, to which all persons must be subject. Jehovah is the “head of Christ”, and therefore Zion, God’s capital organization, is a theocratic government, a pure theocracy. It is a kingdom. Jehovah has made Christ Jesus Lord and King, and Christ Jesus answers to no members of his body for his official acts. There are no individuals in the organization who hold a superior degree or rank of superiority. All are one in Christ Jesus and under him, the Head. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the Teachers, and Christ Jesus at the temple is in immediate command of the organization invisible and visible. Separate and individual rights do not exist, but every member must be in subjection to the Head. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As with Jonah, the people of good will propounded many questions to Jehovah’s witnesses, and received answers like the following: “Whence comest thou?” Answer: From the temple of God, where his King has gathered his people and commissioned them to carry the truth to the people. “What is thy country?” Answer: Our citizenship is in heaven. We are members of Jehovah’s spiritual organization, and our allegiance is to him and his King. “Of what people art thou?” Answer: We are Judeans; that is, we are those who praise Jehovah God and who are in a covenant with Jehovah God. We are followers of Christ Jesus, our Redeemer and Leader, and therefore are Christians. We are the people of God, whom he has taken out from the world as a “people for his name”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations.—1 Cor. 12:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The operation of the holy spirit upon the disciples was not arbitrarily guiding them automatically, but there was much searching, discussion and controversy between them and the spirit directed them in the right way, because they sought to do God’s will. In companies of the consecrated there were many teachers, but the “holy spirit” separated Barnabas and Paul to do pioneer work in the Lord’s name. (Acts 13: 2, 4) When the apostles were assembled at Jerusalem to consider the work the Lord had committed into their hands, “the spirit” guided them into proper discernment of God’s will. (Acts 15: 23-28) Certain men who had mature minds and were devoted to God were made overseers in the church at Ephesus, not by election by members of the congregation, but by the “spirit” they were made overseers.—Acts 20:17-28. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here God’s remnant are forcibly reminded that Jehovah is the Supreme One and he and Christ Jesus are the “higher powers”, and all power in God’s organization is ordained of God, and not of any earthly creatures. In 1914 the kingdoms of this world became “the kingdom of our Lord [Jehovah], and of his Christ”. (Rev. 11:15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.')</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah is the Almighty, the irresistible One, and he has committed to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, all power in heaven and in earth and there is no power that can successfully resist the Almighty and his anointed King. This knowledge aids God’s anointed ones to view their enemies from the proper viewpoint and to know that there is nothing compared to Jehovah, the Almighty God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.—Rom. 8:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s spirit or power is that of life. That spirit in a creature operates according to God’s law, and not according to passion of the flesh. Those mentioned as being in Christ Jesus receive by inheritance from Adam sinful or dying bodies, because born sinners under conditions over which they had no control. In the body of the flesh is the inherited law or rifle of action, that is, the rule to act according to sin, which brings death. But the spirit of God is stronger than said “law of sin and death”; hence those “in Christ Jesus” have been set free from that law by the spirit of God. Jonadabs must all abide in the city of refuge, as a condition to receiving life ultimately, but only to the anointed in Christ Jesus do the words apply that “there is, therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus”.—Verse 1. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/38</span></p>

That channel of communication is designated “The Society”, which speaks to the people of God through its publications, particularly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The Lord speaks now to his people gathered unto him at the temple, and who are fully united and anxiously waiting and ready and alert to follow instructions that come to them from the temple. He will thus speak only to those who remain in full harmony and unity with him, standing firmly bound together in love, with hearts wholly devoted to God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">For everything Jehovah has a fixed time; and this is his time for war. That war will settle the longstanding controversy, and settle it right. Before the beginning of the actual destruction of the enemy Jehovah does his “strange work”, which consists of his causing his name to be declared throughout all the earth and announcing his purpose about to be executed. God has taken out of the world a people for his name, and it is that people to whom he grants the privilege of proclaiming his name throughout all the earth. Everyone who loves God will delight to have some part in the strange work. Such witnesses must first inform themselves of God’s purpose toward them and then be diligent to perform the work assigned to them. The world is at enmity with God, and the day has come when all creation that survives must become God’s friends and faithful servants.

And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh, . . . Cry mightily unto God.—Jonah 3:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message or proclamation comes from the “King of Eternity”, who was represented in “the king”, before whose throne the great multitude must stand and ascribe salvation. That message of Jehovah shows the great multitude what they must do: they must repent and seek the Lord. The king of Nineveh played a part representing Jehovah, and probably therefore the king’s name is omitted from the record. The King’s message is set forth in another prophecy, particularly so at Zephaniah 2:3: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have -wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/38</span></p>

The survivors of Armageddon will be those Jonadabs who henceforth 'seek righteousness and meekness’ and who form the “great multitude”. Together with the faithful prophets and servants of God, who maintained their integrity toward God before Christ’s first coming, these shall live for ever on the earth. The fact that a great multitude maintain their integrity toward God and are carried over Armageddon conclusively disproves and nullifies Satan’s wicked challenge and will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name and word. The power of God is unlimited, and there is nothing that can hinder him in carrying out his mandate to “fill the earth”. When stripped of wickedness, earth will be in a condition for the execution of that divine mandate. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>

The lamb slain pictured Christ Jesus, “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” The blood of the lamb sprinkled upon the doorposts pictured the lifeblood of Christ Jesus, which is the means of protection and salvation from death of those who exercise faith therein. As Jehovah had sent Moses into Egypt, there to make a name for Himself and to redeem a people unto Himself, so God sent Jesus into the world in the name of Jehovah to make a name for Jehovah and to redeem for God and deliver “a people to himself”, and incidentally provide for the purchase price for all who would believe on and serve the Lord. Jesus came in his Father’s name to do his Father’s will, and therefore he upheld Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jonadabs who have children are likewise made responsible for the home instruction of their children in matters pertaining to God’s Word, and that such has the approval of the Lord is shown by the words Jehovah spoke concerning Jonadab’s descendants. God approved what the parent had taught the children and their action toward the parent. Jehovah’s approval and blessing upon those people foreshadowed his blessing upon the Jonadabs and their children who are taught and who obey Him now and who may therefore look for protection at Armageddon. Why should anyone else attempt to assume the obligation God has placed upon the parents? Faithful obedience of parents and their close observance of God’s prescribed rule as to children may result beneficially to them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy name, 0 Lord, endureth for ever.—Ps. 135:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The supremacy of Jehovah God is the pivotal truth. His kingdom is the key by which all doctrines are properly measured, because it is the kingdom that will accomplish his purpose and vindicate his name. The ransom of man is incidental to the question of primary importance. God begs no one to be saved, but does place before man the opportunity of salvation and lets man decide for himself what he will do. Thus man is given opportunity to prove integrity toward God. Jesus was made perfect through suffering, unto death. By thus proving his integrity, he became the author of eternal salvation. He also proved that the Devil is a liar and shall be destroyed, and Christ Jesus is made the executioner with full power and authority to execute the Devil and all his supporters. There God began the vindication of his name, and now the time is at hand to finish it. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.—1 Pet. 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those faithful men of old did not know just why they spoke or wrote, although they searched diligently in their efforts to know. They knew only that they were doing according to God’s will, announcing his favor that should come to others after them; and that was all that was necessary for them to know. They obeyed gladly. ‘The spirit of Christ was in them’; which means they were unselfish in God’s service, moved by love to do always his will. It is the spirit of Christ that now holds the remnant together, and that same spirit moves them to joyfully do the will of Jehovah God. If the Lord’s servant fears to do God’s will because of what man might do to him, that fear is certain to bring him into a snare. If he fears God and trusts him implicitly, he is always sure to have Jehovah’s protection. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The name “Lamech” means “powerful”, and the part played by Lamech in connection with Noah and the flood would picture the Almighty God, whose power is without limitation and who is the Father of Jesus Christ. The name “Noah” means “rest” or “comfort”. Thus Noah foreshadowed the beloved Son of God, Christ Jesus, who is the comfort and rest of Jehovah because always in harmony with Jehovah. Noah, upon leaving the ark after the flood, built an altar to Jehovah and upon it he offered sacrifices. “And the Lord smelled a savour of rest.” (8:21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin}</span><span class="font5"> The destructive work of the flood pictured Armageddon’s great destruction; Noah’s part in offering animals in sacrifice foreshadowed Christ Jesus and his reign of blessedness after Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/38</span></p>

Jehovah commands those who serve him to be diligent in seeking knowledge of righteousness that man may walk in the right way. The man with a pure heart fears God; he fears to do anything contrary to Jehovah’s appointed way. The man who does not believe on nor fear God cannot acquire knowledge of righteousness. For this reason the men who possess what is called “worldly wisdom”, and who are wise in their own conceits, are foolish and their so-called “wisdom” is foolishness in God’s sight. Deliberate wrongdoers have no fear of God. (Prov. 8:13) Any violation of God’s law is evil. Knowledge of the requirements of God’s law is necessary for those who desire to please him.

Therefore they have been announcing that the rule of the Gentiles, under the Devil’s direction, has ended and that the setting up of the kingdom of God and Christ Jesus is at hand, and they have therefore, in obedience to God’s commandments given to them, persistently proclaimed Jehovah’s judgment against the kingdoms of this world. Such binding influence has greatly hindered the religious, commercial, political racketeers in carrying on their work, and therefore, under the subtle advice and counsel of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy crowd, all these elements of Satan’s organization are in a conspiracy and are trying to cast away from them such influence, saying : “Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Spiritual gifts and the witness of the spirit are only to those “in Christ”, being baptized into his death and therefore prospective members of the “little flock”. These God sets in the body as it pleases him. (Vss. 18, 28, 31) All who receive the gift of the holy spirit, and have the testimony thereof, must exercise such spiritual gifts in love, that is, in unselfish devotion to God. (13:1, 2) One might make a consecration to do God’s will, but the holy spirit would not operate through such person unless love or unselfish devotion to God is the moving cause for his action. If one seeks to glorify himself, such would be contrary to God’s spirit. So it is written to those who are baptized into Christ and who are moved by unselfishness: “In every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in no gift.” —1 Cor. 1:5-7.

<p><span class="font5">Those of Nineveh who repented at Jonah’s preaching pictured the great multitude, and for their sakes Jehovah delayed or postponed Nineveh’s destruction. That afforded the repentant ones an opportunity to seek and serve the Lord. Jehovah did not spare Nineveh from later destruction, but did spare the repentant generation then living there from that destruction. Likewise Jehovah will not spare “Christendom” at Armageddon nor desist from his expression of wrath at that time, but in that destruction he will not include those of good will who now turn to him and form a part of the great multitude. This he will do because they obey his admonition to ‘seek righteousness and meekness’ and flee religion. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/38</span></p>

Modern Philistines, the Communists and anarchists, classify Jehovah’s witnesses with religionists because they uphold the Bible and teach it. Ancient Philistines showed they were against God’s people, not only by fighting Saul, but in repeatedly assaulting and trying to unseat David, when made king over all Israel and fully established at Jerusalem. At present religionists, led by the Catholic Hierarchy, are also against God and his kingdom and would run the earth in their own way, in full opposition to God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. The “strange work” of God is to notify all that he is against religionists as well as against all other opponents. His “strange act” is the destruction of all opponents.

<p><span class="font5">Manifestly the Lord was here pointing out to his true followers that they must keep in mind that all those who shall ultimately constitute the members of his body, and therefore be of God’s royal line, must follow a like course as he was blazing, and, therefore, as they would partake annually of the emblems of the Memorial they must have in mind his death, knowing they also must surely share in that sacrificial death if they would live with him. The Lord Jesus was fully informed as to the purpose of Jehovah, and therefore he knew that each one that would be associated with him must maintain integrity toward God and prove his faithfulness unto death, and, being thus associated with Jesus in his sacrificial death, might share with him in his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">So far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned the modern-day Goliath is completely beheaded, and they not only say but are fully determined to recognize Jehovah and Christ Jesus alone are the higher powers and to obey; and when the laws of Fascist governments or the monstrous “state religion supreme” is in defiance of God’s law, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses will obey God, and not man. Antitypically these faithful followers of Christ Jesus, under his leadership, have met the modern-day Goliath with hard stones of truth, and in the name and strength of Almighty God they have defied and continue to defy the Devil’s representatives, which would turn them away from Jehovah. While the “giant” is done for, so far as they are concerned, giant forces of Satan continue to war against them and to persecute them; but they in God’s strength continue to fight on.

<p><span class="font5">During the many centuries in which lawlessness and hypocrisy have been carried on God has been long-suffering toward his enemies. But the end has come and the day of reckoning is at hand, and therefore Jehovah says to his organization under the leadership of Christ Jesus to arise against the Devil’s organization. That part of the commandment which applies to Jehovah’s witnesses on earth directs them to arise especially against the religious element of Satan’s organization. In keeping with this war order Jehovah has commissioned his Chief Officer and all who are under his leadership and command. That commission in part says: “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms.” (Jer. 1:10) That part of the commission applies primarily to Christ Jesus, as shown at Psalm 2: 6, 8, 9.

<p><span class="font5">There is no evidence that any children were taken into the ark. The Scriptures support the conclusion that the beginning of the ‘filling of the earth’ is not due before Armageddon; in further support mark the words of Jesus, which definitely seem to discourage the bearing of children immediately before or during Armageddon: “Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days1” There are Jonadabs now who are fully devoted to God and his kingdom and many of which now have children. The obligation is upon the parents to teach their children the truth concerning Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ and thus lead them that, they may ‘seek righteousness and meekness’. “It may be [they] shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.—1 Sam. 20:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonathan did not engage in the fight with Goliath, but that combat was taken up by David, and after that Jonathan always supported David. The Jonathan class today did not fight the modern-day monstrosity before the David class took up that fight; but now since the David class openly declare against the present-day monstrosity, the Jonathan class join them and fight side by side in support of Jehovah’s witnesses and declare that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are “the higher powers”. They are against the modern monstrosity, that is, the “totalitarian state religion”, which sets up the state as greater than God and his King. Both David and Jonathan were lovers of righteousness and therefore stood shoulder to shoulder for that which is right. The remnant and the “great multitude” must do the same thing now.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chron. 20: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the actual “Seed of Abraham”, and he acknowledges now the remnant on earth as the “feet” members of “the body of Christ”, and hence a part of the seed of Abraham by adoption. Jehovah is the Greater Abraham; the remnant are his children or seed. At the close of the Gentile times, in 1914, “war in heaven” began, resulting in driving out Satan and his spirit hordes from heaven, and the casting of them down to the earth, and the giving of all possession once held by them over to the real seed of Abraham. Now Jehovah has given earth’s rulership to Christ Jesus. Never again will Satan have the rulership, but Christ Jesus, the everlasting Friend of Jehovah, will rule for ever and Satan be everlastingly destroyed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that I shall send thee.—Jer. 1:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Jeremiah was a modest man. Modesty is the possession and exhibition of a moderate estimate of one’s own worth and importance. The arrogant and self-important man is immodest and is therefore presumptuous before the Lord. He has an undue estimate of his own worth. Such was the disposition of Lucifer and led to his downfall. The creature pleasing to God is modest, not thinking more highly of himself than he ought to think, but soberly considering what he may do by God’s help. The true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are modest because the man Jesus was modest and they must be like him. He was “meek and lowly of heart”. He was always diligent to do his Father’s will, and that with delight. He admonishes his followers to pursue the same course. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great multitude is pictured by those who come from every point of the compass seeking the Lord. In this day of judgment through Christ Jesus many persons, by reason of the warning published throughout the earth, are seeing that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will be the earthly representatives of the kingdom, and therefore be in God's kingdom organization, and at the same time they see that the religious Jews, natural descendants of the faithful men of old, and their antitype, the religionists of the present day, will be cast away. The religionists claim to be the spiritual ones who claim to be the descendants of Abraham, and yet they continue to openly practice the Devil religion in defiance of Jehovah. They will therefore never be of the kingdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus presented his right of human life at the mercy seat of God as an offering for the sins of humankind. His blood, therefore, was for the remission of sins. “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many.” (Vs. 28) Christ Jesus did not deposit the value of his sacrifice in heaven to again withdraw it and use it. He laid it down, he gave it up, he parted with it completely, as the purchase price of the human race; as it is written: “Ye are bought with a price.” (1 Cor. 6: 20) When one merely deposits a thing, he may withdraw it or take it back. If he pays it over, he passes title out of himself; and Jesus paid over the price. The human race, therefore, belongs to Christ Jesus by right of purchase, according to the will of God. He purchased it with his own blood. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The words “our spirit” manifestly mean that invisible, moving power within us, within those to whom the text is addressed, and which spirit God has sent into our hearts whereby we recognize that Jehovah is our Father, and so we cry unto him. The relationship of the creature to the Creator is that of son to father. “A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit”; “a thoughtful spirit.” (Prov. 17:27; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> One who appreciates his relationship to God is of a thoughtful spirit, gives serious consideration as to what God has to say to him. If then one has this testimony of the spirit that he is a son of God, it follows that he is God’s heir and joint participator with Christ Jesus in the inheritance of Christ Jesus provided by his Father; and a condition is added thereto, that <sup>f</sup>we must suffer with Christ’.—Vs. 17.

<p><span class="font5">Instead of joining with religionists to dishonor God by putting the state forward as supreme, Jehovah’s witnesses use the weapon of the Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus. It is Jehovah’s kingdom that is at issue, and which is pictured by “the stone”; and with this missile his faithful servants smite the modern Goliath in the head with the great force of the missile of truth, set forth in the Bible, and which renders “the state religion supremacy” totally unable to respond Serip-turally in kind. The advocates thereof try to find support in the Bible for their course, but when the Bible truths are hurled at them their arguments completely collapse. Christ Jesus, as representative of the Supreme Power, takes control of the faithful remnant, and they are determined to follow their Lord and to obey God, and not man.

Every creature that will dwell for ever in the “new earth” must be righteous, and the righteous will never die. (Matt. 25:46) In this present day the Lord of heaven and earth is gathering to himself his “other sheep”, otherwise known as “Jonadabs”, and who will form the “great multitude”, and they and their faithful offspring will be a part of the “new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”. Today the Jonadabs should be very diligent to gain a knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purpose and the manner or way in which he is building the new earth.

Where there is unity, there of necessity must be peace. So Jehovah says: “I will . . . make thine officers [overseers] peace.” That must mean that the time comes when there is peace in his organization all over the earth. God commands that it shall be so, and therefore it is his will that peace must exist. That means that unity and harmony exist among those of the temple company. There </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> unity and harmony in action in the organization, in the field service, in the methods of study, in the assemblies together, and in all activity, and there must no longer be strife, clashes and boycotts.

He is maneuvering both sides. Hearing the songs of the approaching Judeans, the Ammonites and allies think it well to prepare to receive them and take them by surprise, and therefore to prepare an ambush-ment; but the fact is, the Lord Jehovah did the preparing.

The record reads: “Jehovah had set liers-in-wait.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The combined enemy forces thought they would take the Judeans wholly unawares and destroy them before they could realize their situation.

<p><span class="font5">This lays down the rule that the conditions precedent must be met by all who would be saved by receiving the benefit of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus. That which is here emphasized is that the creature must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Believe what? That the Almighty God is Jehovah and that he sent Jesus to ransom man and that Jesus died that by his lifeblood he might become the purchaser and therefore owner of mankind. If a man is not pleased to believe this, does the ransom sacrifice inure to his benefit automatically? Certainly not, because “he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God”.

Those taken out from among men for his name, and who are associated with Christ Jesus, will also participate in vindicating God’s name. Salvation of obedient mankind is of secondary importance, even though those who obey and receive life will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus’ words uttered at the institution of the Memorial show two offices performed by his lifeblood, to wit: (1) The remission of sin, it being the disability that came upon the human race by reason of Adam’s transgression; and (2) the making of the new covenant, by which covenant a people is taken out of the world for Jehovah’s name. The law covenant had failed to accomplish that work. God would now accomplish it by selecting a spiritual class who would bear testimony to his name.

Now God has caused that lamp to be lighted for the benefit of those who love him, and the light of that lamp makes the way clear in which the anointed are to walk. The lamp without a light shining therefrom would be of no aid to those who have the Scriptures, but with the light of the Lord, which he has revealed by and through that lamp, the true and correct guide is had. In this day of Jehovah he has built up Zion. There the light of his glory shines in the face of Christ Jesus and is reflected upon those of Zion. Hence they are enabled to see the way to go. When in doubt about how to decide a question, we must look to the Lord and carefully consider his Word and therein find the answer, and not rely upon human reasoning, however plausible.

The degenerate or wicked offspring of Adam will be dead, so that they cannot exercise any influence over children of the great multitude, such as Nimrod exercised over the generation of Noah’s sons. The kingdom of God then in full operation being to life for the obedient, the children of the great multitude conceived under the kingdom would be conceived to life by the grace of God through Christ Jesus.

It is written: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.” (Ps. 110: 3) No possible excuse or justification can be given for stubbornness or indifference to the commandment of the Lord. The thoughtful and careful servant of God watches, is circumspect, and forms a habit of obeying quickly; that is, hearing the command, they do it now and without delay. In this day of battle it is no time for sleep or to be negligent or indifferent, but everyone must be on the alert and act promptly and willingly in performing his assigned duty. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

Begetting of the spirit, and therefore the testimony of the holy spirit, are not the experiences which Jonadabs have; only those begotten of the spirit and called to the high calling have such experiences.

Jehovah’s witnesses have already experienced that through justification and by becoming new creatures and being taken out for Jehovah’s name. “Salvation” means deliverance from the power of Satan’s organization, which attempts the destruction of God’s anointed. Jehovah will deliver his people who are faithful, and carry them through the battle of the great day.

Since Jeremiah played a prophetic part, those whom he foreshadowed must therefore be the company “raised up of Jehovah”.

The commission God gave to him is given to Christ oh a far greater scale, and that commission extends to his body members. Before Jerusalem was destroyed by the executioner, God sent Jeremiah to bear testimony to that city. What Jeremiah did toward Jerusalem and those connected with it, Christ Jesus, together with the members of his body, now does to the religious organizations of earth and to that particular organization misnamed “Christendom”.

When the consecrated one is assigned a specific duty in caring for the kingdom interests and he becomes weary and, suffering under the galling experiences, cries out, “Oh, let me get away from here. Better that I die than try to do any further work,” such is a manifestation of cowardice. Cowardice is the very opposite of courage. Courage is the result of full faith and confidence that the Lord is backing one up and therefore the Lord will sustain him in the worst time.

(1 Cor. 2:13-15) Now we observe the Scriptural proof that the Lord Jesus is gathering his “other sheep”, who will compose the great multitude; and now spiritual understanding is not decreasing, but rather increasing, because the antitypical Pentecost began after the Lord’s arrival at the temple, and reached a climax in A.D. 1922.

At the time of announcing the covenant of faithfulness and obedience the parents were commanded to bring their children with them, and the children were required to remain quiet and listen to the instruction given and to get as much out of it for themselves as possible.

The latter part of his name, Nathan, is the Hebrew word from which is derived the name “Nethinim”, or “given ones”, that is, “given” for Jehovah’s service at the temple. This would indicate that Jonathan pictured those who serve at the temple. At his birth Saul would consider him as a “gift” from God. He was, however, more particularly the gift of Jehovah to serve the persecuted David, who pictured the Head of the temple. The modern-day Saul class, the religionists, claim the modern Jonathan class is a gift for them, to be exploited and bossed. The name, however, marks the class whom Jonathan pictured as “Jehovah’s gift” to Christ Jesus, the Greater David, and to the “feet” members of Christ, the remnant now on earth. Jonathan pictured their “companions”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The word “graves” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(mnemeion)</span><span class="font5"> means “monument in remembrance of the dead”. Those included are held in the memory of God. Does God hold in memory those who have deliberately joined the Devil and fought against righteousness and betrayed and persecuted the servants of God because they are faithfully doing God’s will? The answer to that question is, to wit, Proverbs 10:7: “The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.” Certainly God would not hold in memory those creatures, religionists who have not only refused to hear and obey God’s Word but opposed him and his servants. They must be included within the class whose name shall rot. Who, then, shall hear the Lord’s voice and come forth ? Only those “in the graves”, in God’s memory.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah of hosts is the Almighty God of War, and he makes it clearly to appear in his Word that all who love righteousness and serve him must boldly take the side of Jehovah and Christ Jesus in that war. This war is against the combined enemies of God and his kingdom, pictured by the Philistines of ancient times. The modern-day Philistines are workers of wickedness, particularly the “totalitarian state” and also religionists, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. All who love righteousness must be against such enemies of God and must take their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah and his King and be diligent in obeying God, and not man. Both Jonathan and David were warriors and were experts with the bow and sling. Both fought against the same enemy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This cup is the new covenant in my blood,. —1 Cor. 11:25, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those taken into that new covenant must first be justified and then be begotten of the holy spirit and therefore have the conditional right to life, and the condition is that they must be faithfully obedient to the Lord ever thereafter. The new covenant brings forth a people for Jehovah’s name, and all who are taken into that covenant, in order to prove their faithfulness, must be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah, by which kingdom Jehovah will vindicate his name. Christ Jesus the King is in the other side of the covenant with Jehovah. He is the Head of the house of sons and he is “The Faithful and True Witness” of Jehovah, and all who continue faithfully in that covenant must likewise be witnesses to Jehovah. Therefore Jesus said: “I am a king. . . . and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Today the religionists want the antitypical David to use religious methods of warfare. The “man of sin<sup>3</sup>’, the religionists, would have Jehovah’s witnesses to compromise and join with them in their methods of fighting against Communism, because they recognize that it is against their religious racket. They want Jehovah’s witnesses to adopt the “Catholic action” way and fight in their armor of religion acting with all other religions, which Roman Catholics call “united Christians”. That kind of equipment does not fit Jehovah’s witnesses, and they will not use it. They will not employ carnal weapons, but they fight as Jehovah has commanded, with “the sword of the spirit”, and which instrument is “mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds”.—2 Cor. 10:4.

<p><span class="font5">God proves Satan a liar and that Jehovah is supreme by redeeming the offspring of Adam and giving life to as many thereof as obey him and prove their integrity. Therefore he provided that the human life of Jesus might beeoiile the purchase price for the human race, opening to them the way of salvation and life. Only Adam was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. His offspring were not on trial. The judgment was entered against Adam, and not against his offspring. However, his offspring being from the imperfect man Adam, all were born in sin, sinners because of inherited imperfections. Adam cannot be redeemed and return and be released from the death sentence without God’s reversing his own judgment; and God does not change. Adam’s offspring could consistently be purchased and given life. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the early days of the church the elders in laying on of hands or hand-stretching were merely giving their expression of mature judgment of approval of the ones put forward to serve. Now, since being gathered to the temple and anointed, all the temple company have come to eldership or maturity in Christ. In place of the apostles or others clothed with'such authority, who acted in the absence of Christ Jesus, there is now at the temple Christ Jesus himself, Jehovah’s great Apostle, who is in full control. (Heb. 3:1) He is clothed with absolute authority, and, being in complete control of the organization of Zion, he directs its operations. Therefore he, the Head of Zion, now at the temple, fills all the offices, to wit: Great Elder, great Deacon or minister, the great Pastor or Shepherd, and great Bishop.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 68:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By making known Jehovah’s supremacy and his work and blessings of his kingdom, the faithful lay up treasure for themselves. It is Jehovah that has provided, and that gives, the message of truth, and it is not the message of man or any company of men. It is a &quot;great” company, a company greatly favored, that is, privileged to publish the message of truth, which God gives, and such have a part in his &quot;strange work”. That work is now in progress. It frightens the enemy, and the enemies flee and hasten to gather together and prepare for a final assault upon the publishers of God’s message. In that final battle God’s remnant will have no part, and therefore no use for carnal weapons. All that have part in the vindication of his name will share in the spoils.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus has gathered his body members together, forming the temple of Jehovah, and all of the temple company do now show forth Jehovah’s praises by wholeheartedly obeying his will and their Leader’s commandments. This is the time of complete unity in Christ, and all who are on the Lord’s side move forward in a solid and compact body against the enemy. Jehovah never does anything against the enemy secretly, but always openly. He gives the enemy full notice while the opposing armies are maneuvered into position for the final conflict. Everyone of the temple must have a vision of God’s purpose. All such must move with one accord under the command of Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple organization. All who murmur or complain against God’s organization or oppose it give evidence they are not in the temple and are no part of God’s organization.

<p><span class="font5">David’s father was Jesse, and his name means “existing ; living”. Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of the great life-giving One, Jehovah, the King of Eternity. As the name “David” means “beloved”, so Christ Jesus is the “darling” or “beloved” of God, the everlasting Father. Like David, Jesus was a man after God’s own heart. He was no easy-going sissy. He was a bold and valiant fighter for God’s cause, and his weapon of war was and is the truth, the Word, “the sword of the spirit,” which he wields to destroy the wicked and to uphold the lovers of righteousness. Jesus taught his disciples to be bold and fearless, and all his true followers are bold and fearless of creatures. They fear God, and not man, and therefore they obey God, and not man. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Jonah 3:10; 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new name “Jehovah’s witnesses” meant that more work was to be done and that “Christendom” would be spared destruction for a time that this further work might be done. The selfish ones were daily expecting to get away to heaven, that they might occupy some high position. The revealed truths showing God’s mercy was being extended to the people of good will and giving his servant class opportunity to do something in their behalf caused the selfish ones to become very angry and sulky. That more work must be done before Armageddon, and done in the face of opposition by antitypical Assyrians, the political, religious element, such was very hard on the proud ones. Being anxious to get off to heaven while they had some reputation, these truths revealed in 1931 caused them to become huffy and angry. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 26: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The breaking is of very great importance and cannot be ignored or passed over. It is of vital significance to all who participate with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. It means that they must become members of the body of Christ and be broken with him and therefore die with him in order to share in his kingdom glory. Jesus’ words meant: “This bread represents my body.” The bread was merely a symbol; the breaking of it discloses what must be done to those of the body of Christ. Eating of the bread did not mean that those eating appropriate it to themselves and are thereby justified to life, or that upon that bread all must feed and be sustained by Jesus’ humanity. Everyone must be first justified before he can become a part of that bread which is afterwards broken. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He hath chosen us in him . . . having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself.—Eph. 1:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witness of the spirit had a definite beginning, at Pentecost time. That time of operation of the holy spirit was foreordained and predestinated. This is proof that God did not adopt the holy prophets as his sons and they never had the witness of the spirit. God predestinated the time for the beginning of the adoption through Christ Jesus, who was the first and head of the house of sons. Even John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ Jesus, was not adopted and has no heavenly inheritance. God having foreordained and predestinated and marked the time for the beginning of the witness of the spirit, he would mark the time when the gathering of the earthly company or “other sheep” of the Lord Jesus would begin, and the time when the witness of the spirit by and through the “comforter” would cease to be given.

<p><span class="font5">This supports the conclusion that final judgment is entered by the Lord as to some before or at the time of death, and as to those who have maintained their integrity toward God the judgment is that they shall live, and thus God speaks of such things that are to come to pass as though they were already come to pass and that such are alive. (Rom. 4:17) Hebrews eleven says the prophets endured great affliction that they might have “a better resurrection”, and they “obtained a good report through faith”; and for that reason it is properly said of them beforehand that 'they lived unto God’. God put them to the test and approved them and counted them worthy to have a resurrection from the dead. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Danger that threatened God’s people united them. With earnestness and diligence they began to seek the face of the Lord. Then the faithful realized that he dwells in his temple organization and that his spirit is upon the temple company. The threatening attitude of the enemy awakened them to the fact that all their protection and salvation come to them from Jehovah through Christ Jesus and that they must trust in the Lord and in him alone. Seeing themselves entirely separated from Satan’s world and forming no part of it, they put their trust, not in armies or carnal weapons, but solely in the Lord. With these faithful ones there was and is no going down to Egypt for help, protection or salvation. They were and are determined to put away from themselves all things out of harmony with God and his law and henceforth rely solely upon God and his provision.

<p><span class="font5">They did not hide themselves for fear of the enemy or sing lowly for fear of arousing the enemy. By faith and in advance of the victory they were celebrating God’s victory over the enemies. Today Jehovah’s witnesses have full faith and are certain of his victory over the enemies. Knowing that Armageddon will soon be fought and will be the scene of victory, they engage in the Lord’s service, and with full confidence push forward in doing witness work. This they do by publishing his kingdom message publicly; not secretly, but openly and “with an exceedingly loud voice”. They are bold in this day of judgment (1 John 4:17,18), and decline to soft-pedal the message for fear of the enemy. Jehovah directs their course and provides for them protection and salvation.

<p><span class="font5">God’s instruction to his creatures concerning obedience cannot be too strongly emphasized. The law of Almighty God, which is made plain, without an exception demands that every creature that is given life eternal in the heavens or in the earth shall learn obedience to the Most High. It is therefore necessary that every creature who would live everlastingly should have a knowledge of what God requires, which necessary knowledge can be had by man only by a careful study of the Scriptures. Those Scriptures now God is making clear to those who diligently seek righteousness. The evil world shall end at Armageddon; and Armageddon is near. From the Scriptures it appears that God, in the execution of his purpose toward his creatures, requires that everyone who receives his approval must obey his commandment. There is no exception to this rule made for any creature. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When raised from the dead and exalted to heaven, Jesus returned the right to human life and presented to Jehovah the value of that perfect human life as the price for the right to life and all rights incident thereto which man had lost. Certainly that does not mean that Jesus would give life to any of Adam’s offspring that would not willingly comply with the divine rules. Every person is born imperfect, and therefore a sinner, and for that reason under condemnation. Such condemnation would in due time mean destruction. There is just one way to get from under that condemnation, and that is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. All men are under it by inheritance, and that condemnation abides upon all who do not avail themselves of the opportunity to comply with the divinely fixed rules.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Jonah t'7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was Jehovah who directed where the lot should fall, and it is he, through Christ Jesus, that reveals the cause of the trouble, as well as the result. Anti-typically he directs the attention of the people of good will in distress to his elect servant, Christ Jesus, and his faithful followers on earth working under his command. In 1922 the faithful ones learned that the Lord had come to the temple, and Jehovah poured out his spirit upon all flesh, that is, those devoted to him and of the servant class, thus causing the lot to fall upon them, and calling attention to his message, which his servant delivered to those who are seeking safety and security. These are directed to the proper source. Jonah clearly represented Christ Jesus, the elect of Jehovah, and his associated servants, who lift up the standard of Jehovah for the aid and comfort of people of good will.

<p><span class="font5">Those that walk after the flesh walk according to the law of the flesh and serve “with the flesh the law of sin”. Those who do not so walk, but walk after the spirit of God and walk or pursue the course of action as anointed spirit creatures, begotten of the spirit of God, thereby fulfill God’s righteousness. Now also the Jonadabs, although human for ever, must walk according to God’s spirit rather than according to the flesh, because the Lord can receive only those who pursue that course of righteousness. By the word “flesh” is meant to devote the mind and course of action to the things of this world, of which Satan is the invisible ruler, and to follow and practice the things that the world follows and practices, and that are contrary to the will of Jehovah God.

Their hope is not in heaven, but is that they might live on earth forever. Being “strangers in the camp” who have devoted themselves to God and Christ, they must participate in declaring the name and the kingdom of God under Christ. But since they cannot share in the death of Christ Jesus and hence cannot partake of his resurrection, it would be entirely out of order and improper for them to partake of the Memorial emblems. To do so would be doing injury to themselves. It will be entirely right and proper for them to be present and observe what is done, that they may have keener appreciation of the anointed’s relationship to Jehovah and the relationship of the great multitude to God and to Christ. It should be and is a time of rejoicing for them also, because they appreciate that the day of deliverance has come. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Noah’s three sons foreshadowed a class of people that are counted righteous in God’s sight, that is, the “other sheep” or Jonadabs, who form the “great multitude”. Christ Jesus, the antitype of Noah, is “the everlasting Father”, who ministers life to the obedient ones of the human race and does so as active representative of Jehovah. Noah’s sons were born a short time before the flood; likewise Christ Jesus, a short time prior to Armageddon, brings forth the “great multitude”. Noah’s sons were born near the end of the world that then was, and now the Jonadabs appear in the end of this “evil world”, and are to be regenerated by Christ Jesus. As with Noah and his sons, so a long time has elapsed since the birth of “the man” Jesus till the birth or bringing forth of the Jonadabs, who receive regeneration.

<p><span class="font5">That means that all life originates with God, and none can have and enjoy life without his permission. No one can take life contrary to God’s expressed law and at the same time be exempt from responsibility. God’s everlasting covenant is his emphatic declaration concerning the sanctity of life. By his law he has provided that, under certain specified conditions life may be taken. Let all take care to learn what is the proper time and what are the conditions. Without such knowledge evil or wrong is almost certain to be committed. God at times designates certain ones or bodies of men to act as his executioner to enforce his judgment against the wrongdoer. The everlasting covenant was stated to Noah at the time he was righteous in God’s sight, and Noah was made God’s executioner of the murderer. This establishes the rule that all execution of wrongdoers must be done in righteousness, that is, in harmony with God’s law. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/38</span></p>

Today Jehovah’s witnesses stand solely for Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ and are blind to everything else, and therefore they refuse to “heil” politicians, to salute flags, and to pay homage to men, and this, and their attitude toward the League of Nations or confederacy of nations, and also their exposing of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in its effort to control the world, greatly anger all the elements of Satan’s organization. Therefore all these elements of Satan’s organization, to wit, commerce, politics, and religion, sympathize with one another in their efforts against and opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses, and combine in their persecution of those who represent the Lord on earth, to destroy them.

The letters of the apostle Paul addressed to Timothy and Titus, applying to the “last days”, now apply to the Society; and the things committed to Timothy and Titus to do, and the special charge to them, are performed by the Society, acting under the direct supervision of the Lord Jesus Christ at the temple. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jonah received a specific command to go to a heathen or non-Jewish city and there warn the people of the disaster about to fall upon that city, and to do so that those who would repent might find a place of protection and safety. This foretold the witnesses of Jehovah in the day of Jehovah being directed or commanded to give warning to the people of good will that they might ultimately find safety and be gathered into the “great multitude”. Now Jehovah would prove that even a heathen people, when learning the truth, would show more faith in Jehovah than the Israelites showed, and would repent and seek the way of righteousness, even at the warning of a foreigner, a Jew at that. The people of Nineveh did show greater faith than the Jews. Today some of the Jonadabs or “other sheep” show greater faith than many of the prominent ones supposed to be of God’s servant class.

<p><span class="font5">Our instrument of warfare is the Word of the Almighty God, the sword of his spirit, which, when wielded by his joyful army, shall root out the defamers that have hidden themselves in a great mountain of vicious lies. We have no fight against any human creatures. We must not and will not attempt to inflict bodily injury upon any creature. We have no maliee against any man. We are not fighting to do injury, but to do good in the name of God. We are engaged in a holy and righteous war, prompted entirely by unselfishness and, at Almighty God’s command, prosecuted with vigor against the most stupendous system of racketeering and crowd of racketeers that have ever operated against men. Only the spirit of Almighty God, operating through his Word, can and will root out that devastating religious system. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So Christ was once offered to hear the sins of many. —Heb. 9:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ right to human life was the ransom or exact corresponding price required, and therefore constituted and is the redemptive price for Adam’s offspring. By presenting his right to live as a human creature before the mercy seat as a sin offering Jesus became, by right of purchase, the owner of Adam’s offspring. The ransom is an exact corresponding price of purchase required and consisted of the perfect human life of Jesus Christ. “Sin offering” is the ransom price paid over for the purchase of the sinners. ‘^Without shedding of blood is no remission.” (Vs. 22) The man Christ Jesus had shed his lifeblood, and his right to human life is represented in the blood. Raised out of death, the divine Jesus presented in heaven the purchase price and paid it over at the seat of justice, and thereby purchased Adam’s offspring.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 11:26, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who properly partake show they recognize the purpose of His death and that it is their privilege to suffer and die with him in order to live with him and reign with him, sharing his glory. Christ Jesus has now come to the temple, but there are those yet on earth in the flesh and who properly celebrate the Memorial and should do so till their change come, when they are changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, giving up the human organism and receiving at the Lord’s hands a spiritual body. It is enjoined on them to celebrate Memorial and thus bear testimony to their relationship to God and Christ Jesus. They would be woefully negligent if they failed to do so. “Till he come,” therefore, means till the last member of the body of Christ on earth finishes his course and is changed from human to spirit.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to he born.—Eccl. 3:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is there proof that the time for exercise of spiritual discernment is here and that adoption of the spiritual or royal sons is about over or no longer the general work of the Lord? Yes; and it is the fact that prophecies and types relating thereto and to the “other sheep” are being revealed to his people and understood by them. The spiritual remnant, according to the known proved rule of action by which Jehovah discloses his prophecies, are now understanding. That rule is that such understanding would not be given unless the prophecy or types were fulfilled or beginning to be or were in course of fulfillment. Therefore disclosing the fulfillment of prophecies, and the meaning thereof, is proof that the time for the adoption of the spiritual or royal sons is about over. Opening the understanding in regard to the great multitude must be proof marking the time that the gathering of the “other sheep” had begun or is beginning.

<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the monstrosity of state religion is useful as an instrument when it can be controlled, the Hierarchy adopts like tactics and practices, and puts in motion machinery to compel flag saluting, “safety of state” gag rules, “unity of nation” measures, and other dictatorial methods. All these make the state or national rule a “god” or mighty one of supreme power. In order to suppress and destroy Jehovah’s witnesses the Hierarchy and like religionists join forces with this “state religion” monstrosity when convenient. It is put forward to frighten everything that is for Jehovah and his kingdom and to cause to be unfruitful the efforts of his people, and to advance the selfish interest of God’s enemy. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The kingdom is actually here, and the King is performing his functions. That being true, there could be no further occasion to employ the democratic form of government in congregations of God’s people by voting for or against those put forward for service. Since the coming of the Lord Jesus in 1918 there is a reorganization of the Lord’s servants, even though the consecrated come to a knowledge of it some time after the change is made. It is the sole prerogative of the great Theocrat to appoint the members and set them in their places in the body of Christ as it pleases him. He acts by his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus. God has not set up a separate and superior clergy-class or so-called “holy orders”, but all of Zion are on a common footing, and “one is [their] Master [Teacher], even Christ”. —Matt. 23: 8.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~Whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not.—2 Chron. 20:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have never at any time been commissioned by the Lord to destroy literally those who compose the visible elements of Satan’s organization. They have been plainly told that vengeance belongs to Jehovah and he will repay; consequently their work is different from using carnal weapons. Hence Jehovah’s witnesses have not advocated or engaged in revolutions, or any like attempts to overthrow worldly institutions. They have never encouraged anyone else to do so. Their sole duty and commission is to inform the people of God’s purpose to destroy Satan and his supporters, thereby giving warning to those who are of good will toward .God that they may flee to the place of safety in God’s organization. Jehovah has permitted the wicked institutions to remain till his due time to show his power. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they two made a covenant before the Lord. And David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.—1 Sam. 23:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonathan made a covenant with David for life, that Jonathan’s house or offspring might survive and thus be spared just retribution that would come upon the house of Saul because of wrongful persecution of David, God’s anointed king. This clearly pictures that, although some of the Jonadabs or “other sheep” may be killed at the hand of the enemy before or during Armageddon, yet many of the “other sheep” of the Lord will be spared and live through Armageddon and Jehovah’s Executioner will not act against them. The prophecy shows there will be some, and probably many, spared. If one is obedient to the Lord and continues to seek righteousness and meekness, he may be spared death; but if he dies faithful, the Lord will manifestly give him an early resurrection. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Any words of assurance that could come from an earthly creature would now be wholly inadequate to bring assurance to God’s people and give them hope. They must have a message from Jehovah, and Jehovah never fails his people. Therefore the Lord Jesus at the temple transmits the message through his earthly agency and to his people now in this hour of peril. If the oncoming enemy threatening destruction were a manifestation of God’s displeasure with his people, they would have great reason to be afraid; but now they remember the promise to them: “According to your faith be it unto you.” This is no time to fear men or devils. There is but one possible result as far as the Lord and his organization are concerned. Why should God’s people now have no fear of the enemy ? The answer from the throne of the Most High is, “For the battle is not yours, but God’s.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.—John 18:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one that is of the truth, that is, that gives heed and obeys, hears his voice and follows in his steps. Such must bear testimony to the truth concerning God and his kingdom. As Christ Jesus is the Chief and Foundation Stone of God’s capital organization, the new heavens, so all the members thereof, as ‘diving stones”, are built up into that spiritual house that they may perform acceptable service to God and Christ. All such must be made to conform to the Head, Christ Jesus. All must suffer at the hands of the Devil, even as Jesus suffered, and all must learn obedience and be obedient and faithful to God and Christ under such conditions. Every one of Christ’s followers called out of the world who fails or refuses to be fully obedient to the Lord’s commandments must suffer destruction. (Acts 3:23) Obedience is not discretionary, but is mandatory. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The radical element of politics and commerce, at the present moment allied with religionists and religions racketeers, will turn upon the religious allies and put an end to them. With the beginning of Armageddon Satan’s organization is certain to be divided against itself. At that time there may be an attempt to escape in disguise, but it will not work when the Lord is directing the matter at the final fight. Vindication of Jehovah’s name is at stake, and the Lord Jesus, his Chief Marshal, will not be deceived by any manner of disguise the religionists may wear. In the present, as in the past, the Lord has maneuvered the forces of the enemy into a position where they shall meet with destruction. The Lord will see to it that the Devil’s followers will destroy one another. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Is it Scriptural to hold that one must be begotten of the spirit before he can be everlastingly destroyed in “the second death”, from which there is no resurrection? One who willfully rejects the Lord and his kingdom and persecutes those who advertise God’s kingdom is certainly sinning against the light, because it is His spirit that causes the light to shine out that men may see the way to salvation. Such, therefore, is sinning against the spirit of God. If awakened in the reign of Christ, is there any reason why they would avail themselves of the ransom and obey the divine law? It does not so appear. God’s Word holds out no hope-of salvation to those religious leaders who willingly oppose his kingdom and his King, nor for the adherents of those religious systems who likewise willfully oppose.

<p><span class="font5">That Jonathan was much older than David suggests that he, a part of the time in the picture, represented some persons who served God before the coming of Christ Jesus, the Greater David. He well pictured the faithful men of old who gave their lives as a testimony to God and his coming kingdom. Before the coming of Christ Jesus the faithful men of old, who were witnesses of Jehovah, were put in peril of their lives by enemies of God, like Saul, and under the circumstances proved their integrity to God. It appears, therefore, that Jonathan pictured the faithful martyrs who preceded the day of the coming of the Lord Jesus, and whom the Lord, in due time, will “make princes in all the earth”.

<p><span class="font5">Jeremiah did not ask for or accept a license from any of the rulers to go about and deliver his message, because God had commanded its delivery and no power could give a license to do or could properly prevent doing what the Almighty God commands. Exactly like conditions exist today. The message Jehovah’s witnesses and companions deliver at God’s command is very unpopular with the clergy, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This does not frighten those who love God, however. His witnesses shun not to declare the message as commanded, nor do they compromise by permitting that message to be censored by others, nor do they ask for or receive from men a license to deliver the kingdom message. God has commanded that it shall be done, and when the laws of man are contrary to God’s law the faithful will obey God’s law and take the consequences as God may will.

<p><span class="font5">Jonah was willing to put his life entirely at the disposal of Jehovah. If his death in the sea would make it possible for others in the ship to be rescued he was willing for that. Here Jonah shows the spirit of Christ Jesus, who permitted himself without resistance to be led to execution that others might be saved. His action also sets a precedent for Jehovah’s witnesses, who must go forth in Jehovah’s service at this time, and that at the risk of life, that they may serve God and deliver his message in behalf of the people and thus afford them opportunity to be saved. They must warn the people not to try to carry Jehovah’s servants off the course of strict observance of His commandments, but, on the contrary, they, being of good will toward God, must find the way of escape and safety by co-operating with his servants.

The only way of reconciliation of men to God is through Jesus Christ by man believing and proving himself faithful. Abraham and other faithful men mentioned in Hebrews eleven believed God’s promise to send the Messiah and that he would be the Savior and Ruler of the world, and they looked forward to his kingdom and refused to have anything to do with the wicked world, having their hearts set upon the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font5">gdom under the Messiah. Because of their faith such men were counted righteous, but they did not receive life at the time, because Jesus Christ must first purchase the human race with his own blood and then proceed to deliver them in God’s appointed way.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Moses . . . had respect unto the recompence of the reward.—Heb. 11:24,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When did the consecrated one devote himself without condition to the Lord, and what thereafter did God’s spirit guide him to see and to appreciate as open for him and his place ? If he saw and appreciated the heavenly things and the privilege of being dead with Christ Jesus and thereafter forever living with him in the spirit, and he responded joyfully to the service under the conditions set before him, that would be testimony of the spirit. Did he set his heart on heavenly things, and not on things in the earth ? One cannot properly be indifferent to the reward set before him. One who sees that the reward is to be with Christ in heaven and who then joyfully responds and follows where the Lord leads, will, if called to the heavenly calling, see and appreciate it, and therefore have the witness of the spirit that he is a prospective joint-heir with Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1J38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To like murmurers Jesus said: “Is thine eye evil because I am good?” The Lord conducts his work as it pleases him, and all who love him rejoice in the knowledge of that fact and delight to do according to his will. It is not for any creature to criticize Jehovah because he extends his mercy to anyone he may will to do good unto. Because men tried to fix the date when God would destroy modern Nineveh and God did not back up their prophecy but apparently extended the time in order to give others an opportunity to hear the truth and take their stand on the Lord’s side, is that any cause to be peeved ? Is there any justification for peevish murmuring or angry condition? There is certainly none. The true servant delights to do the will of his Master.

<p><span class="font5">This need not be understood to mean that all the “unjust” are to be brought forth at the end of the thousand years. Verses 5 and 6 tell of the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah ‘turned into ashes’, destroyed, as ‘ensamples to those that afterwards should live ungodly’, and showing how they shall be destroyed. Verses 10-22 describe a class to be utterly destroyed in the day of judgment, that is, from 1918 onward, to wit, a spirit-begotten class that become wicked, and also those who have learned of and then despise God’s kingdom, all of which are unjust and are to be punished at the time the godly “remnant” and “other sheep’’ escape. That willfully wicked class still exists and includes the “goats” to be punished in this day of judgment with everlasting cutting-off.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the great Father of all those who live. He is the great Teacher of those who are of his household. (Eph. 3:14,15) He used Abraham to mark out the proper course. Thus God revealed the proper course and designated the ones who shall teach the children. Abraham here correctly pictured Jehovah, the great Father and the One in whom the household of those who love God shall be taught. “Zion”, is the name Jehovah gives his organization, which is pictured by a good woman who gives birth to the children of God, and in Abraham’s course Jehovah sets forth the proper way those children should be instructed, and this is supported by Isaiah 54:13: “And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those anointed and therefore sons of God must and do set their minds and affections upon things pertaining to God and his kingdom. Likewise, the Jonadabs, having taken their places on Jehovah’s side, must also set the mind and affection on God and his kingdom rather than on the things of this world to which the inherited flesh is drawn to serve the law of sin. “For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.” (Vs. 6) The Jonadab is in the way of life because of having taken refuge in God’s organization under Christ Jesus, and sets his mind on the things of the kingdom, though he is not spirit-begotten. The desire of the true Jonadab is for God’s kingdom; there is his heart devotion, and he refuses to mind the things of this world.

Such is an unselfish devotion to what is right. Where such love exists between persons, neither one looks upon the other from the standpoint of the flesh, but looks upon the heart and his outward devotion to righteousness. Such was the love Jonathan had for David; and David returned that love. It was a mutual love, because both were devoted to right and were doing the right thing as the servants of Jehovah. Thus they pictured those classes of persons, namely, the remnant and the Jonadabs, both of whom are devoted to Jehovah God and hence have and manifest mutual love for each other.

The apostle specifically instructed Timothy as to the required qualifications of the servants to be selected, and warned him he must act with caution after due and prayerful investigation and consideration. Selection of servants by the democratic method of voting by the congregation ignores the command concerning “the Higher Powers”. Only Almighty God and Christ Jesus constitute the higher powers. The apostle Paul was a special representative of such higher powers. Acting by virtue of the authority conferred on him, he designated others to represent the higher powers. The stretching forth of the hand was an act of confirmation by the apostles. The apostle Paul confirmed Timothy as his representative.

The sailors in the ship, including the master, picture the people of good will and honest heart, who desire to go in the right way, which the Lord opens to them. Those who obey him constitute his “other sheep” and form the “great multitude”, which multitude in due time enters the Lord’s service and proclaims his Word and his praises.

Christ Jesus is the great Watchman, and under him are those of the temple class who are made members of the Watchman and therefore are appointed to watch and care for the kingdom interests and to faithfully perform all service in connection therewith. They watch in behalf of one another and of those of good will who are seeking the way to Zion. Armageddon is certain to come, and Jehovah’s witnesses must not only inform themselves, but inform others, that they may have opportunity to find the way of escape. Not only will Armageddon vindicate Jehovah’s word and name, but it will also avenge the faithful remnant upon the “goat” class, and at the same time make the way clear for the great multitude to walk in the light of the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the great Teacher, great Prophet, great Judge, and the great Counselor. (9:6) In sending him to the temple Jehovah has, by one act, fulfilled the above prophecy. Thus Jehovah sets up Zion, his faithful city or organization, with Christ Jesus being the absolute ruler as the Executive Officer of Jehovah God. Therefore The government is upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus’. He is the Higher Power next to Jehovah, the Supreme Power. (Rom. 13:1, 4) That part of the Lord’s organization on earth, therefore, acts under direct supervision and control of Christ Jesus at the temple. Christ Jesus performs all the official acts of Jehovah, including appointment and discharge of servants. The organization is God’s, and not man’s, and since the Society is the Lord’s representative on earth, he uses it for his purpose.

<p><span class="font5">It is the faithful at the temple that pray to and trust in the Lord to guide them in their movement and in all times of danger. They know the Lord is all-powerful. They love him and trust him and are determined to do his will, and hence rely upon the promise that all things done work together for their good. They pray to Jehovah and at the same time study his law and testimonies to ascertain what is his prescribed rule of action for them by which they must be guided in dealing with opposers of the kingdom in order that they may not in any manner compromise with the enemy. They see they must hold themselves aloof from the enemy organization. Seeing their relationship to God and his kingdom, the temple company resolved to obey him at any and all costs.

<p><span class="font5">Today God gives no new prophecies by inspiration; he raises up no prophets today. If anyone claims to be a prophet now, let it be known that such a one is a foolish person and a false prophet, even as Jesus foretold. (Matt. 24: 24) But God does have a channel of communication through which he makes plain the fulfillment of the word of the former inspired prophets, and the temple company must believe in that channel as the agency used by the great Prophet, Christ Jesus, and must believe in the prophecies set forth and must follow in line with such prophecies revealed to them by the Lord. Now is “the time of the end”, and it is God’s time to unlock his prophecies, and the time for his remnant to study them and get the proper appreciation of such prophecies and then to exercise active belief or faith in such prophecies by doing the commandments of God.—Dan. 12: 4-9. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By the terms of that commission we are informed what must be done by all whom the Lord approves. The Lord is directing his forces against the hypocritical religious enemy, and His declaration is that the leaders in that organization as well as the organization itself shall be completely ‘rooted out’. The devilish, religious system which long ago was planted beside the “waters” of the earth, that is, the peoples of the nations, has grown great and mighty. Shall the Devil be permitted to longer continue to use that system and its supporting elements to deceive the people and to defame God’s holy name ? No; because the Almighty God has decreed that she shall be rooted out, pulled down and destroyed, and the time to begin that work has arrived.

Jonah did not go into a booth that represented rejoicing, as was done at the feast of tabernacles, but he fixed himself up a shack for his own ease and comfort. Likewise the class he pictured fliide themselves in a shack’ and wait to be taken home. They are really indulging in a sit-down strike. Those who really complain against God are yielding to the influence of the Devil. Like Jonah, the sulkers wish to avoid “the heat of the sun” that always comes with real work.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah could have destroyed all of Adam’s stock and started a new race, but it is his will to prove his supremacy by taking out from Adam’s offspring those who prove their integrity toward God and to give such eternal life and use them as a monument to his name and word. Such faithful ones constitute a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The redemption must first take place before anyone of Adam’s race could be taken out for Jehovah’s name or given life. The blood of Jesus shed at Calvary made good and operative the new covenant. His lifeblood is also the purchase price of the human race, and by and through it deliverance will be administered to the obedient, ones. Remission of sin must first take place before a people can be taken out for Jehovah’s name and be associated with Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">Jonadabs do not expect to die; their hope is to find protection during Armageddon that they may live for ever upon earth, and that means they would do violence to God’s Word and put themselves in jeopardy by partaking of the Memorial emblems. Those of the little flock look on all things of earth as temporary and on the things of heaven as everlasting, and there their heart and affection are set. They know they must be dead with Christ Jesus in order to live with him, and therefore are duty-bound to observe Memorial by partaking of the emblems. Both the little flock and the great multitude, by being baptized in water, outwardly testified they are fully consecrated to do God’s will. Those of the little flock go much farther than that. All who will live with Christ Jesus in his kingdom must be baptized into his death. Only sheep of the little flock are baptized into his death.

<p><span class="font5">The ‘offering faith’ does not mean all will accept that offer. After God raised Jesus from the dead the religious leaders had no faith; certainly then they would not accept the offering of faith if brought back from the dead. Acts 17:31 does not include those who are wicked and beyond recovery and who died in that condition. Since 1918 we are in the judgment day when the Lord is separating the “sheep from the goats”. If the “goats” now refuse to hear God’s Word and to take a stand on the side of the Lord Jesus Christ, and refuse to have any faith therein and in his kingdom, what more could be done for them if the Lord would bring them out of death and give them a “second chance”? The Lord Jesus says these goats go away into everlasting cutting-off, destruction. They will not be awakened out of death. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>

(1 Tim. 4:12) So likewise “The Society” is comparatively a youthful organization, having existed as such only since the Lord’s coming to the temple. Yet it is not to be despised for that reason, but to act in harmony with the will of God and the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus came to the temple in 1918, he did not select an individual as his representative and servant, but did select a company of faithful men and women as his servants and formed them into an organization representing his kingdom interests on earth and made that body his “faithful and wise servant”, to which he committed all his kingdom interests on earth. That “servant” he built up in Zion as a part of his capital organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is love; which means he is wholly unselfish. He loves righteousness, and loves his creatures that follow after righteousness. “For righteous is Jehovah; righteous acts he loveth, an upright one shall have vision of his face.” (11:7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Poth.)</span><span class="font5"> This rule of the Most High is a signboard pointing the way to life, and those who desire to live will give heed thereto and go accordingly. Jehovah created the heaven and the earth: “The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people [who live everlastingly] see his glory.” (97: 6) Jehovah God is the source of life, and is the Giver of life to all his obedient creatures. (Prov. 12:28) Only those who love righteousness shall be blessed with life. Jehovah God administers life to his creatures through his beloved Son.

<p><span class="font5">No Philistine could gain David’s favor by slaying Saul and Jonathan, thus to make the way clear for David to become king. Likewise at Armageddon, no political crowd, and none of their followers of the monstrosity, the “state religion combine”, can gain any favor of Christ Jesus, the Greater David, by burning the “great whore”. Nor did the Philistines intend to help David by fighting against Saul; their purpose was to reproach God’s name. Later they attempted to destroy David. This shows that after the religionists fall at the beginning of Armageddon the political, commercial, and radical “state religion” crowd will be against Jehovah’s witnesses.

Parents should impress upon the child that those who obey God and do his will may receive protection during the great tribulation about to fall upon the world. Is there a parent so dull that he cannot teach his child these great fundamental truths? Certainly not, if he has any love for his child. The parent should instruct the child that we are now in the time of peril, and that the child and the parent should stick closely together and render aid to each other, and carefully avoid following in the way of the world, which leads to despair and destruction. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/38</span></p>

To this end Jehovah maneuvered those conspirators in their movements against Jehoshaphat and Jerusalem. This proves that Jehovah provides for the protection of his people and maneuvers the enemy into position for their own destruction. Without doubt Jehovah is now maneuvering the enemy forces in leading them to a position where they will attack against the Lord’s anointed. The circumstances and conditions furnish an opportunity for the anointed to prove integrity toward God, and those covenant people who do maintain their integrity furnish a good and sufficient reason or grounds for God to destroy the enemy forces that come against his people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/38</span></p>

The kingdom of Jehovah, under Christ Jesus, is his means of carrying out his purpose. Noah therefore pictured The Christ, “the man Christ Jesus” and the members of his body, all composing the royal house of Jehovah. The members of Noah’s family pictured the “other sheep”, the people of good will, who show their faith in and devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ. The flood and the devastation it wrought pictured Armageddon and its destructive results. The primary purpose of the deluge was the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and to uphold his word.

Men will have no occasion to fear beasts, nor will beasts have any occasion to fear man.

(Ex. 12:26,27) That obligation laid upon the head of each household was and is perpetual, thereby showing upon whom the responsibility devolves for informing children. He who devotes himself to Jehovah must watch to keep himself in the faith and to prove his integrity toward God.

Jonathan did what he could to strengthen David’s hand in the Lord. Today the Jonathan class learn of the name and purpose of Jehovah, and their devotion is to God and his King.

It is always best to follow the course that Jehovah marks out and wait upon the Lord. A man might be recovered from the error of his way. Therefore we must show mercy and wait for the Lord to act, because his wisdom is perfect and he always acts at the right time.

No, but exactly the contrary. Adam was a willful sinner. (1 Tim. 2:14) For that willful transgression Adam was put to death, because that was God's announced penalty for sin. There is no reason to conclude that Jehovah will reverse his judgment ; because God changes not. All Adam’s offspring were necessarily brought under the condemnation by reason of the fact that they inherited imperfection from Adam. They were not on trial. The judgment of death was not entered against them; but being born in sin, they must die because of inherited sin unless redemption is provided. Opportunity of salvation is given to Adam’s offspring through the shed blood of Christ Jesus.

But the battle is not man’s; it is God’s fight, in which man is permitted to have some part in order to prove his integrity toward God. It is God’s “strange work”, which he has risen up to do, and he commands his servants to join in that war. Then will follow God’s “strange act” to be performed by Christ Jesus and his host of invisible warriors, resulting in the complete wiping out of Satan’s organization.

That would not necessarily mean that after such dates there would be none spirit-begotten. If one once in line for the kingdom becomes unfaithful and falls out or is cleared out, then surely the Lord would bring in another to fill that vacated place in the body of Christ. (Matt. 22:1-14) It follows that the one who is brought in to fill such a vacated place would have the witness of the spirit and that witness of the spirit will enable such a one to see and appreciate that he is a spiritual son of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/38</span></p>

To go forward in the witness work in the face of the cruel persecution by the “goats” the witnesses of the Lord are in much danger of violent action’s being taken against them; but, as opportunity offers, the “other sheep”, that is, the people of good will, must assist the remnant and co-operate with them, even though it places the remnant in increased danger. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

In this respect the Jonadabs and his remnant are in the same situation. One must have the spirit of Christ if he is in Christ Jesus. Those spirit-begotten and anointed are in Christ, hence in the spirit, although they serve in an organism of flesh.

Such is the greatest privilege ever granted to creatures. A similar privilege will never again be given to men on the earth. Keep in mind that when you agreed to do God’s will you surrendered all your individual rights, and your sole duty is now to magnify His name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At present God’s people must have arrived at the antitypical “tomorrow”, the time when they must “go out against them”, the enemy. By what was published immediately after the Washington, D.C., convention of 1935 the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as the antitypical Philistines were made known by the Lord to his people, and that religious crowd was made bare and shown to be the modern-day Edomites. Against that wicked crowd God commands his people to now “arise . . . against her in battle”. (Obad. 1) Therefore God’s people are not to be fearful or dismayed at the sight of the enemy’s boasting and wicked action. On the contrary, the faithful are to boldly “go out against them” by proclaiming the King and his kingdom, which will vindicate Jehovah’s name. Jehovah gives the positive assurance he will completely back up his people. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">David his ten thousands?—1 Sam. 29:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honest people regard Jehovah’s witnesses as entirely different from religionists, who pretend to worship God. Jehovah’s witnesses have made no personal attack against individuals, but have fought against the reproach of Jehovah’s name, and this has put the Saul class in an inferior place in the minds of thinking persons. The position of Jehovah’s witnesses against “state religion supremacy”, and their bold stand for Jehovah and his kingdom as supreme, have shown up the Saul class, who practice their religion for selfish purposes and gain, and not to the honor of Jehovah God. Reasonable, sensible people see that religionists are hypocrites; hence those people of good will turn away from religionists and turn to God and his King, the Greater David.

<p><span class="font5">Today God’s people have come to the end of the world over which Satan is overlord, and by God’s grace they are permitted to observe the fulfillment of divine prophecy. They now see that God is progressing with his creating of the new earth, and this fills them with joy. In the new Jerusalem God’s name shall forever be praised. Jerusalem is the name applied to Jehovah’s universal organization. Zion is the name of his capital organization, which organization exercises ruling power over all by the will of God. Jerusalem, therefore, includes the great multitude, the “other sheep”, who shall also participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jerusalem, therefore, is to be an exultation, and the people of God’s organization a joy. His organization shall be a joy to Jehovah because a vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Let all quibbling, strife and discord cease. Zion is now builded up, and all of Zion must know and do the will of God. King Solomon was a type of Christ Jesus, who is the builder of the real temple of God, and what was recorded concerning the building of the typical temple ‘happened for ensamples’. Jewish kings were formally enthroned and crowned in the spring of the year. Jehovah would induct into office his now reigning King in the spring, to wit, of A.D. 1915. Therefore the “fourth year” of Christ’s reign would begin in the spring of A.D. 1918. “The second month” would begin shortly or about one-half month after Memorial of that year, or, to wit, about the middle of April 1918, marking the beginning of the building of the antitypical temple by the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Now Satan’s representatives, filled with malicious hatred, lie in wait to take undue advantage of the righteous ones. Satan has put that murderous spirit in the heart of the modern-day Ammonites, Moabites and others to take Jehovah’s witnesses by surprise and crush them. The enemy expect to draw them into a trap, and are setting such traps, as flag-saluting and like things. The just fall “seven times” under oppression by the enemies, as in 1918, but rise up again, even as now, when the Nazi-misguided Germans persecute the righteous. Back in ancient days Jehovah maneuvered the enemy and set the ambush and caused the enemy to take that position which would result in their own downfall. The enemy make the pit for God’s people, but they fall into it themselves. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The divine requirement is that, when one believes Christ Jesus is man’s Savior, to receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice he must turn away from this world’s wickedness, seek the Lord, ask for and take advantage of the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. The same rule of faith, consecration and sanctification applied to the men of old. (Hebrews 11) All of them exercised faith in God and believed his promise to set up a righteous government. Believing such, they set themselves fully to rendering obedience to God, and by’ their faithful course of action they ‘declared plainly that they were seeking the kingdom’. They died in faith and faithful to the Lord. When the time comes that they are brought forth from the grave, they will quickly and joyfully accept and receive full benefit of the ransom sacrifice.

<p><span class="font5">The modern Saul class, the religious leaders, employ threats and boycott and other wrongful methods to induce Jehovah’s witnesses, the remnant of the devoted class on earth, to make music pleasing to the clergy that they might be soothed during their fits of madness. They would have “the harp of God”, his Word, used only to soothe their satanic madness; but Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to thus compromise with the Devil and his agents. Jehovah’s witnesses delight to play upon God’s harp, and they do so continuously, but their music does not remove the cause of the clergy’s madness. The wickedness increases in them as they hear the music from the Lord’s harp, and they seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah avoid clergymen, because they know they can do them no good. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A courageous person trusts wholly in the Lord and fights on to the end. Selfishness is the moving cause for complaint and murmurings. The one who forgets self always rejoices in the Lord regardless of how severe his trials may be. Seeing that God.has set a day for Armageddon, at which time he will afford opportunity for some to be spared, and that God has given opportunity to the remnant to now preach or carry the message of truth to those of good will that they might be of the saved class, it appears to the faithful as a great and blessed privilege of serving God, and this makes the faithful to rejoice. But not so with the selfish one, He wants to do his own will, and not the will of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jonah was commanded to “go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it”. The people must be informed of the cause of its downfall. Likewise with the beginning of Jehovah’s day the time for “Christendom’s” destruction drew nigh. Before its destruction takes place Jehovah’s witnesses, at his command, must go forth and declare its doom is impending, and also announce God’s reason for its destruction, that when the fall takes place the word and name of Jehovah will be vindicated. Also the proclamation affords opportunity for all persons of good will to hear, believe the truth, and flee to the place of protection which God has provided. In sending Jonah to Nineveh, therefore, God made a clear picture relative to the duties laid upon his consecrated servants at the beginning of the day of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus Christ as Head of Jehovah’s organization Zion has a visible part of his organization on earth, which represents the Lord and acts under the direct supervision of Christ Jesus. Otherwise the Lord’s work in the earth would be without order. His “faithful and wise servant” class is made up of all the anointed ones on earth brought into the temple into unity in Christ, and acting in complete unity under his direction. (Matt. 24:45-47) Paul, as the representative of Christ Jesus, delegated to Timothy and Titus authority to act in certain matters of appointing servants in the church. The Lord Jesus, now at the temple and in full charge of every part of his organization, according to his own word delegates to his earthly representative, to wit, the Society, certain duties to be performed in his visible organization, and which duties must of necessity include the selection of servants. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There was no envy or covetousness on the part of Jonathan toward David because David had the higher position. Likewise the “great multitude” now, the people of good will, do not covet the position of the remnant, nor envy the anointed because of their higher position in Jehovah’s organization. They rejoice to do whatsoever the Lord gives them to do, and with joy they contemplate the everlasting blessings in store for those who remain steadfastly faithful to Jehovah and his kingdom. The “other sheep” now joyfully labor with the anointed as companions, lovers and friends. They are willing and glad to have the anointed David class take the lead, and delight to follow that lead in the field service, rendering their reasonable service.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus took a loaf of bread, which was unleavened, symbolizing a sinless or justified condition, and then he said to them, in substance: 'As we break this bread you will observe that it represents my body [the body of Christ, which is pure and without sin]. Each one of you must eat thereof [that is, partake with me, and thus become my partner and share with me in being broken].’ His words “This is my body” could not refer to his human organism, because of him it is written: “He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” (Ps. 34: 20) “A bone of him shall not be broken.” (John 19: 36) The man Jesus did not die by reason of any part of his body being broken, but undoubtedly as the result of a broken heart. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

(Vs. 18) The Jonadabs, or “other sheep”, are in a different condition. They have fled to the Lord and there found refuge. They are still human creatures, not even justified, because receiving life everlasting depends upon their faithful obedience within God’s organization and faithfully abiding there till his wrath is passed at Armageddon. They must show appreciation of God’s goodness by faithfully obeying his commandments, and continue to seek meekness and righteousness and to joyfully await the time when they shall be fully ushered into the flock of the Lord and receive life everlasting on earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show there are those who because of their wickedness will never be brought out of death but will abide under God’s wrath for ever, and that the dead in “the graves” are in God’s memory and will be brought out, but it does not appear that all of them will be “accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead”. “That world” is “the world to come”, “wherein dwelleth righteousness” (2 Pet. 3:13), the “world without end”. (Isa. 45:17) At the end of the thousand-year reign the final decision and execution of judgment will take place. Then those who have by the great Judge been “accounted worthy” are made manifest, approved, and given life everlasting. Jesus’ above words, therefore, would not apply to the time when Jonadabs, surviving Armageddon, may marry and “fill the earth”.

<p><span class="font5">The offensive weapon of God’s witnesses on earth is his Word. The members of his army on earth still walk in a fleshly organism, but they operate according to the spirit of God. The Lord then says to these faithful witnesses: “And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is- fulfilled.” (Vs. 6) This means that when God’s servants faithfully obey his commandments they are in readiness to proclaim his vengeance against all disobedience and by this means to expose the hypocritical enemy. Every person who is on the side of God and his kingdom must and will arm himself with the Word of God and go forth in obedience to his commandment. Have you obeyed to thus arm yourself? and are you carrying out God’s commandment? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In this Jonah pictured a class of the consecrated who are “happy” while things are going according to their selfish pleasure, and who have often expressed themselves in this manner: “I am happy to have this comfort and ease and blessing of the Lord.” What a difference the joy of the Lord brings to one who fully devotes himself to Jehovah God! When self-ease and comfort and honor are taken away, the selfish want to get off the earth and they cry out: “Let me get out of here and go somewhere that I may serve the Lord.” They reason that if they could die and go to heaven^ and there lord it over some others, that would be fine and to their liking.

<p><span class="font5">Thus the Israelites were protected from the expression of God’s wrath against the Egyptians, representing the Devil’s organization. Likewise those who followed Noah into the ark and remained there were hidden or immersed and thereby baptized unto Noah. (1 Pet. 3: 20, 21) Both Moses and Noah pictured The Christ, Jehovah’s royal organization. Therefore even the Jonadabs at this present time experience baptism unto the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Coming under the protection of his organization, they now find shelter, and if they continue there to seek righteousness and meekness, rendering themselves in obedience to the Lord, they have the promise of deliverance from the wrath of God at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus Jonah prayed. Likewise the “faithful servant” class prayed and gave thanks, and continue to do so. The prayer was not merely to escape death to be able to lead a selfish existence, but that the servants of God might live and serve him and his King and maintain their integrity toward God and honor his name while on the earth. Each day the faithful continue to utter their prayers and thanksgiving to Jehovah for his loving-kindness bestowed upon them in permitting them to be again engaging in his service. Their prayers then ascended, and continue to ascend, at his holy temple, where Christ Jesus, as Jehovah’s representative, presides, hears and answers the petition of the faithful ones, and directs them in the proper course in his service. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus was actually put to death for a sin offering and was resurrected to fullness of life, but his disciples were dead first in sins, because of inheriting death through Adam. Thereafter they were dead as human creatures with the right to live as such, in order that they might be a part of the sin offering. Hence, after being spirit-begotten, their mortal or fleshly bodies were quickened by God’s spirit or energized to serve God. Being dead toward sin is different from being dead sacrificially with Christ. The Jonadab, not being received as part of the sin offering, and not being in the covenant by sacrifice with Christ Jesus, is not in Christ; but he must follow a course that is dead or contrary to the sinful world. He must seek righteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All who will find security must take their stand firmly on the side of God and his King. This is not a religious movement, but is a united course of action against religion and all parts of Satan’s organization. For centuries Jehovah has been preparing for this very hour. His time has arrived to execute his vengeance against all that oppose his kingdom. Anyone who will now maintain his integrity toward God must be wholly and completely devoted to the kingdom, because it is through the kingdom that Jehovah will vindicate his name. Now is the time when the love of Christ binds firmly and solidly together all the anointed. That means that selfishness must not be found among them. The Lord has committed his kingdom interests to the anointed temple company, and of such he demands full and complete fidelity in harmonious action to advance the kingdom interests.

During the forty years of the “Elijah work” God did not cause his people to attack the combined commercial, political and religious elements of the Devil’s organization. But God’s due time must come and has come to declare the “vengeance of our God” against every element of Satan’s organization. Not even Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Executive Officer, was permitted to destroy the enemy before God’s due time. Now the time has come when Jehovah has begun his strange work against his combined enemies and is thereby sweeping away their stronghold of lies, and the commission given by Jehovah to his people is set forth in Psalm 149:6-9 and is in operation, but did not become operative until after 1918.

<p><span class="font5">The singers should “praise the beauty of holiness”, which means Jehovah God, who is in verity “the beauty of holiness”. Because of his holiness and beauty he will clear out all unholy things and institutions, such as devil leaders against Jehovah’s organization. The singers before the army gave greater prominence to God’s temple and the servers at his temple who praise his name than it did to the weapons of war; it showed that the faith of the people was in Jehovah, and not in themselves, nor in any earthly force. The singers would sing exactly in harmony, because they were trained and because they were commanded to say: “Praise the Lord.” That shows complete harmony and unity in action, rather than everyone singing his own song.

Zion is now builded up, and the creating of the new earth begins. The mandate of Jehovah is that the earth shall be filled with righteous people. (Gen. 1:28) That divine mandate shall be carried out to a completion. Concerning the carrying out of this purpose Christ Jesus, the Head of the new heavens, says : “Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” The “other sheep” will maintain their integrity toward God under the test and will form the “great multitude”. Such shall inhabit the earth for ever. They, together with their righteous offspring, shall fill the earth. They also must conform fully to the rule of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">Knowing David was right and had the favor of Jehovah God because he was right, Jonathan loved David with a true and pure love, and they were bound together with that love that Christ exhibits. Here was pictured the love of the “other sheep”, whom Jonathan represented, for the remnant, whom David at this point particularly pictured. The love that exists between the remnant and the “other sheep” is not that affection after the flesh which is called “love”, but which is really not love. Their unselfish devotion to each other is because both love righteousness and hate wickedness and both look to and expect to receive everlasting life through Jesus Christ. Jonathan and David were lovers of righteousness and pictured the people who are real lovers of righteousness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/38</span></p>

They pray constantly for the peace of the organization. In a compact and united body the remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs, with joy and songs of praise to Jehovah march out to war against the enemy, and they hear the words of Jehovah saying to them: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude [of the enemy]; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” Are you in this army of the Lord marching to war with songs of joy and praise upon your lips ? Are you trusting solely in the Lord and going forward doing your part? Every one must perform the obligation laid upon him. No one can substitute for you. No one can sit idly by and let someone else do the work, and then expect to receive God’s blessings. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In withholding Armageddon, Jehovah is showing great mercy to those of “Christendom” who repent and flee to his organization, and also affording opportunity for others to repent and flee to him. Those who do turn to him are a rebuke to “Christendom” for not repenting. God will not destroy “Christendom” until he first shows mercy on the repentant ones in her. This fact should be an example of warning and an aid to all “Christendom”. “Christendom,” like the Israelites, ask for a sign more specific than that pictured by Jonah’s preaching. The religionists ask for something more than the proof that the Jonadabs, the modernday repentant Ninevites, are fleeing to God, when they hear of his gracious provision for salvation; but they shall have no other proof. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.—1 Cor. 11:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those in Christ Jesus must and will discern the body of Christ; that is, they will clearly distinguish between the body of flesh and the body of The Chkist. “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.” Only such properly, worthily partake of the Memorial emblems. To partake unworthily means to be unfit and to partake irreverently. Says the apostle: “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the feast.” He means those in the class to which he belonged, the spiritual class. If one is a Jonadab, he is not in Christ; and if he is not in Christ, he cannot share in Christ’s death and resurrection. It would therefore be improper for him to partake of the Memorial emblems.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.—Phil. 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul saw that God had fixed his future reward with Christ Jesus in heaven and that he could not serve the Lord forever except in that place, and therefore he set his heart wholly on the kingdom. He admonished others who have set heart and hope on the kingdom to be of like mind. (Vs. 15) Evidently the witness concerning one’s status or place is not dependent on what any man or organization may say. It is of the spirit, and each one must come to know it for himself, whether he is of the spirit or not, and must be convinced and prove it by his course of action. No real Jonadab strives for or looks forward to a reward of the high calling in heaven, for the reason that God by his spirit does not implant such impulse or hope in his heart. It is Jehovah who does the calling. He sets members in Christ’s body as pleases him. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Judgment of the rest of the dead is described at verses 12-15. That judgment will be climaxed by the test imposed by Satan at his release from the abyss at the end of the thousand years. Neither the faithful men of old, described in Hebrews eleven, nor the Jonadabs that are carried over in Armageddon, are included among those who make up “the rest of the dead”. It is written of the faithful men of old that they get a better resurrection. As to the earthly class, the judgment begins, as shown by the parable of the sheep and goats, with those living on earth in 1918. Judgment of the “rest of the dead” takes place when Satan is released from the abyss and applies his wicked influence against mankind. Therefore the conclusion must be that the rest of the dead “lived not” until the end of the thousand years. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No doubt the enemy expected to make a surprise attack upon Jehoshaphat, but the Lord God prevented them from so doing. Jehoshaphat, being informed, had time to make ready for the attack. Likewise Christ Jesus knows in advance of the attack of Satan’s forces that will be launched against God’s people at the battle of Armageddon, and through his angels he transmits that warning to his faithful people now on the earth and which warning is also transmitted to their companions. Jehovah now forewarns his witnesses of the coming assault. Thus he does by using Christ Jesus at the temple to disclose to the temple company these truths and through them gives information to others concerning the meaning of the prophecy. The warning from the Lord is brought by his servants on the earth, and they give heed thereto. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consecration</span><span class="font5"> means to believe on Christ Jesus as man’s Savior, and the unconditional and voluntary agreement to do and perform the will or commandments of God and of his Son, who executes Jehovah’s purpose. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sanctification</span><span class="font5"> means not only such belief, but to set oneself to the task of serving the Lord as his willing servant. Having thus agreed to do the Lord’s will, then the man must perform that agreement faithfully. Consecration, sanctification and obedience are required of everyone who receives fully the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. Everyone who becomes a member of the royal house in heaven not only must believe Jesus is the Son of God and man’s Savior, but must prove that belief by completely setting himself to the task of doing God’s will and therefore following faithfully the lead of Christ Jesus.

Each one who covenants to do His will thereby becomes a witness to the name and purpose of Jehovah. Such testimony he must give before all as opportunity offers, and surely that opportunity to give testimony before the children of his own household is always with him. When consecrated parents obey Jehovah and teach their children, religionists as the Devil’s agents induce the law-governing power to punish the parent and the children. When dutiful parents suffer because of properly teaching their children as commanded, such is suffering for righteousness’ sake, because it is suffering according to the will of God and furnishes the opportunity for both parent and child to maintain their integrity toward the Most High.—1 Pet. 4:12-14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/38</span></p>

Seemingly a bungle had been made; but not so. The result was the direct “act of God”, foretelling his “strange act” that he will cause to come upon the enemy at Armageddon. Today the “great whore” is riding on the back of “the beast” and is fatally bent on destroying God’s faithful remnant. She expects to have this destruction brought about at the hands of the commercial and political crowd; but Jehovah informs his people that, “strange” as it may seem to religionists, the “ten horns” and “the beast” will hate the old whore, snap back, tear her and burn her with fire.

In that “twentieth year” there assembled the most constructive and important conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses, to wit, in Paris, France, in August, and at Columbus, Ohio, in September, 1937. September 26, 125 radio stations broadcast the address “Worshiping God”, wherein was condemned the conduct of commercial radio stations and operators for improper use of this God-given facility.

<p><span class="font5">When a creature demonstrates by his course of action that he is a lover of righteousness, then we may know that Jehovah God loves that creature and will show him his favor. Jehovah reveals himself and his purpose to those who love righteousness and who hate wickedness and who so prove themselves by diligently doing God’s will. “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (97:11) It is only those who follow the course of righteousness that receive the benefit of God’s revealed light. The Scriptures uniformly show that it is the righteous who gain knowledge and understanding thereof, and the facts fully corroborate the Scriptures. Righteousness exalt-eth the nation.’ (Prov. 14: 34) There is but one nation in existence or that ever did exist that fulfills this scripture, and that nation is composed of God’s people under Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Many claim that Jehovah’s witnesses want to “make martyrs of themselves” to gain notoriety; and so such say: “It is a strange work, in which these Jehovah’s witnesses engage to bring themselves into notoriety.” This small band of youthful creatures have gone forth against the giant monstrosity, created and organized by the Devil and trained in all the arts of trickery and devilish warfare. These faithful followers of Christ, with their “life in their hands”, have gone forward and pitted themselves against the satanic organization. Jehovah has been and is their shield; he directs their course, and they sling straight the stone of truth given them by the Lord’s hand, and it hits the mark. It is therefore Jehovah’s work, “his strange work,” and he permits his witnesses to have part in it. They must trust him. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/38</span></p>

Therefore they knew the One who had stilled this storm was the Almighty God. The sacrifice offered by them was a part of the picture, and, being in harmony with the Scriptures, must have been a sacrifice of the lifeblood of some animal, for ‘without the shedding of blood there is no remission’. (Heb. 9:22) This part of the picture shows that those who cry unto The God, are heard, and make vows and sacrifice pleasing unto the Lord, must exercise faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, because there is no other name whereby they must be saved.

To all who are against God and his kingdom it is strange because they do not have a vision of God’s purpose to now clear out the Devil and his organization and to establish complete righteousness under Christ His King. This is God’s “strange work”, and is the fulfillment of his prophecy long ago written. This work must be done and completed before God begins his “strange act” at Armageddon.

His law provides that if a man attempts to burglarize the home of another he might be killed with impunity. In self-defense, therefore, man may protect himself against the wicked assaults of men or beasts. In harmony with this God’s law is: “There is ... a time to kill.” (Eccl. 3:1-3) Those who kill contrary to God’s law and merely to satisfy their own pleasure or desire do so in violation of God’s everlasting eovenant and must take the consequences. In his Word he caused examples of his purpose and manner of administering retributive justice to those who have wantonly killed wild beasts of the field and fowl of the air.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation ... of laying on of hands.-Heb. 6:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Laying on of hands was not an annual affair, such as the yearly selection of servants, according to the practice once in vogue. When a person was selected to perforin certain duties, there was no need to renew that selection so long as the person appointed acted in faith and faithfully. With God’s typical people Israel the laying on of hands was not a practice of the congregation, but was restricted to the duly constituted representatives of the people. Such laying on of hands did not indicate voting by some voting in the affirmative and some in the negative. Jehovah selected the Levites for his service without taking a vote of the people. When the time came to select a successor to Moses Jehovah did the choosing. It was the apostles who commended the elders to the Lord, just as Paul did. —Acts 20:32. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The house of Jonathan being restored to all that had been lost through Saul’s wicked course and downfall shows that the Jonathan class are now permitted to enjoy the privileges which the clergy and the “evil servant” class lost, of working for Jehovah and his kingdom. These also have their spiritual food from the Lord’s table, even as Mephibosheth ate at David’s table. The sparing of the lives of Jonathan’s descendants for many generations well pictures that, while some of the great multitude may die before Armageddon is over, yet the Jonathan class, that is, those who make up the great multitude, will as a class survive Armageddon, which class may, after Armageddon, “be fruitful and multiply,” and their offspring have a particular blessing from the Greater David.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus was then speaking of his “sheep”, the “little flock”, who become members of God’s royal house of sons, and it is to such, and such alone as prove faithful, that his words apply. It is the spirit-begotten ones, taken into the new covenant, that must eat the bread and drink the blood. But do not all persons who ever get life on earth have to “eat of the bread’? No, only the spiritual sons eat the bread, and drink the blood. All who get life on the earth must have and exercise faith in the lifeblood of Christ Jesus poured out for the remission of sins, but at the institution of the Memorial Jesus was inviting his disciples alone to be broken with him and to be dead with him and to thus share in his death and in his resurrection.

<p><span class="font5">None of the “little flock” will have a desire to boast of his superiority over others now, nor to make those of the “other sheep” feel abashed in his presence. In the service the anointed remnant should take the lead and the Jonadabs should joyfully serve with them, but the motive of each one must be an unselfish devotion to God and his kingdom. All the sheep must be harmless. Bach one must render good unto others as opportunity is afforded, especially to those serving God and his King. Christ Jesus loves his sheep that he gathers into the fold, and all body members must love them also; for “if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he. is none of his”. The anointed remnant will be diligent to help the other sheep, and will do so unselfishly, and the oilier sheep will joyfully co-operate with the remnant. All will move forward together in giving a witness to the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The reason that wicked religionists now seek the destruction of God’s remnant is not because of any fault of the remnant, but because these servants of God faithfully proclaim his Word of truth. Exactly in harmony with what is stated in the Psalm the religionists, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, seek to destroy God’s people who witness to the truth. This they do not because the remnant and Jonadabs have done anything wrong, but because they have faithfully proclaimed and continue to proclaim that religionists shall not rule the wprld but God’s kingdom alone shall rule it. They have conspired together to bring about the destruction of the Lord’s witnesses and to prevent his kingdom. Now Armageddon approaches, at which battle God will destroy the opposers.

After that the Jonadabs have seen the manifestation of such spiritual sons. Having seen and appreciated that the King Christ Jesus has come and gathered his approved ones to the temple, the Jonadabs have ceased from groaning and now ignore the pain because they see the day of deliverance is at hand. Their earnest expectations have been realized to that degree. “And not only they, but ourselves [body members of Christ] also, which have the firstfruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves [until the Lord’s coming in 1918, and particularly the pouring out of the spirit in 1922], waiting for the adoption.”-Vs. 23. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/38</span></p>

No; it results beneficially only to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey him. Adam could not be redeemed; for the reason that the judgment against him is final. No judgment was entered against his offspring, and therefore such are subject to purchase or redemption; but such purchase does not result automatically for the benefit of everyone, but only for those who exercise their privilege of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and doing the will of God. Jesus “gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time”. His life was given as a ransom for all who believe and obey him, and in due time the testimony thereof is given.

<p><span class="font5">Is there any justification for the combined elements of Satan’s organization in committing assaults upon Jehovah’s covenant people? These questions Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great judicial officer, can and now does determine, and he plainly states that they are wholly unjustified and are doing wrong, and that he will execute judgment by sending all such enemies into complete destruction. The Lord has commanded his people to worship God in their own inherited “land” (privileges) by diligently proclaiming his kingdom and his vengeance against his enemies, and that they must now do this alone, and not engage in politics or employ commerce or religious methods in doing their work.

Regardless of what any creature on earth may do, the Lord will destroy the enemy in vindication of his name; but those, and only those, who show full faith in and obedience to God’s Word, as written in the prophecies, will prosper and therefore share in the results of his glorious victory. As the anointed march to the final conflict, they must all be in full unity, because the Lord has so commanded. They must participate in the fu</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lfillm</span><span class="font5">ent of the prophecies heretofore written, and as they are fulfilled, and they must believe in God’s Word and deport themselves accordingly if they would prosper.

<p><span class="font5">Obedience to God always brings upon the obedient ones suffering and affliction heaped on them by Satan and his agents, which affliction and suffering has afforded Satan the opportunity to endeavor to carry out his challenge and also affords Christ’s followers the opportunity to prove their integrity toward God. Faithfully obeying his commandments, and bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name amid all manner of persecution even unto death, proves Satan is a liar, and is in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Proceeding with the creation of the new heavens, God takes out from among men 144,000 redeemed men.

Davidas marriage to Saul’s daughter Michal did not ■prove satisfactory, nor did it bear any fruit to the kingdom. It ended in scorn upon David by that woman because of his faithful devotion to Almighty God. David was Jehovah’s servant and was entirely in the right, and it was wholly out of order for Michal to criticize him. Other women might take a good suggestion from this. Every servant stands or falls to his own Master, the Lord, and not to some individual. This Michal pictured those who manifest for a time some love for Jehovah’s witnesses and some disposition to serve him, but who afterwards turn against him and his servants and criticize them.

They care not for their own honor, so long as God approves them. They are not man-pleasers nor seeking to please men. The reputation of an individual is of no importance, because such is beside the real issue. To harp about the reputation of a man is but to becloud the great and important issue. This is the Devil’s way of turning the attention away from God to creatures. Of course, such is no excuse for anyone to indulge in wrongdoing or to plead this as justification for wrongdoing; but the point here made is that the ones who accuse the Lord’s servants are really opposing or fighting against God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15J38</span></p>

It therefore follows that all who will not joyfully get in line in obedience to this commandment the great Executive Officer by his angels will gather out. It is the time of war against the enemy, therefore the time of united action of all those in God’s organization. It is the time of peace, righteousness and complete unity, and hence harmonious action in service among all those devoted to Jehovah. Let everyone in God’s organization see to it that he thus walks humbly or obediently with his God, that is, Christ Jesus, “the Mighty God,” and Jehovah, the Supreme One.

Those faithful men feared Jehovah, and thus they were men of wisdom, and they continued to follow that wise course as long as they lived; and all the people of earth who live must likewise fear God and take a similar course. The people of good will are here represented by “all the kingdoms of those countries”, which fear God both before and continuously after Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">The mere fact that a man is sincere in his devotion to his religion, and believes that by following religious instructions given to him by his clergyman he will be saved, is no evidence whatsoever that he is even approaching salvation, but, on the contrary, such person is being led directly into the Devil’s snare. Why are religion and religious practices detrimental to men? Because religion is based upon a false conception of God and his provision for man, and is the invention of Satan, God’s enemy, and intended by the enemy to mock God and to destroy men. It is a fraud and is deceptive because operated in the name of God and Christ, when in fact it is exactly opposed to Jehovah and his kingdom. That which is false cannot possibly sanctify one and enable one to walk in the paths of righteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.—Jonah 4:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Anger</span><span class="font5"> against Jehovah is never justifiable. Jonah’s reply was rebellious, to say the least; therefore in this he represented those who rebel against God and try to justify their own course. God now exhibits mercy and loving-kindness toward those in the world that are of good will toward him, and his work in behalf of such continues by his faithful servants. Against God’s mercy the objectors and complainers rebel and show great anger. They see others coming to Jehovah’s organization and themselves not permitted to occupy positions they have long coveted. That causes their anger to greatly increase and them to say: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Yes, we do well to be angry, even unto death.” They put themselves in opposition to the Lord’s work on earth and are therefore cast out of God’s kingdom. The angels do the casting-out work. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s witnesses are commanded to lift up, not the standard of some earthly government, over which Satan is the invisible ruler; the standard which God’s people are commanded to lift up is that of Jehovah, pointing the people to the only government that can ever bring to mankind peace, prosperity and everlasting joy. Never have creatures on earth been given such a privilege as this. Do you have understanding ? Do you appreciate your relationship to God and his kingdom under Christ? If so, are you doing your part to carry the message of warning and of comfort to the hungry and thirsty people ? Everyone who is on God’s side must now be a witness to his name.

<p><span class="font5">After Jesus had instituted the Memorial and the faithful disciples had partaken thereof, signifying their determination to faithfully follow in his footsteps, Jesus invited them to share with him in his kingdom. Only such in a relationship to the Lord similar to that between the apostles and the Lord could be taken into the covenant for the kingdom. Only those who are in Christ and who share in his death have a part in the kingdom. This excludes everyone but the spiritual and anointed ones, and these alone properly and worthily partake of the Memorial emblems. In 1918 the Lord Jesus appeared at his temple and there began judgment of the consecrated, spirit-begotten ones. The ones approved have been taken into the temple. His true followers have since partaken of the Memorial, not in sorrow, but with joy, because the Lord is with them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The opening of life to the Jonadabs, or “other sheep”, certainly could be no reason for any consecrated person to be indifferent as to the outcome of his own course. All the consecrated and spirit-begotten ones must become men of understanding; they must come to have an appreciation of being called to the high calling and therefore of their relationship to Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, has opened or revealed the meaning of his prophetic pictures concerning those “of good will”, that is, Jonadabs, the “other sheep”, and this he has done particularly since 1931. A consecrated and true Jonadab can see and appreciate the Lord’s provision for him and the Lord’s rules of gathering his “other sheep”, and so doing he falls in line therewith and joyfully adapts himself to the Lord’s provisions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 5:24,25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The final decision need not wait until the judgment day; but the sins of such men are open and deliberate, and final judgment has been entered beforehand against the deliberate wrongdoers. “The good works of some are manifest beforehand”; hence the destiny of such is fixed before the day of judgment. Thus the final judgment may be entered concerning the wicked and the good before the day of judgment. For this reason Paul, with propriety, says of himself: “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.” (2 Tim. 4: 7, 8) If the final and adverse judgment against the willfully wicked is entered against them before death, there would be no reason to awaken them out of death. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That means that God's organization arises to give battle to the enemy, which enemy is represented on earth chiefly by the <sup>f</sup>old harlot’. Soon at Armageddon God, through Christ, will destroy the religious systems that work fraud and deceit, and then completely wreck every part of Satan’s organization. Before this falls upon the world Jehovah sends forth his faithful servants, commanding them to give warning to the people of his purpose, that the people of good will toward God may flee to his kingdom under Christ and- there find safety and salvation. If you are on the side of God and his kingdom it is your privilege and bounden duty to engage in this “strange work” of the Lord. Will you do your part and prove your faithfulness and integrity? or will you sit idly by and rest your hope of salvation merely upon a little knowledge you have gained in times past, and in what you think is your sanctimonious good character?

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, at God’s command, has builded the capital organization of Jehovah God, pictured by the ark and into which the faithful must be immersed, dipped and submerged out of sight of and completely separated from the Devil’s organization. For that reason they are no longer a part of this world. Inside or under the protection of Jehovah’s organization such faithful ones may be safely carried through that expression of God’s wrath at the battle of Armageddon. This was all made possible by the resurrection of Christ Jesus from the dead that he might live and be the vindicator of Jehovah and do the work of saving the obedient ones.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee.—Ps. 45: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lover of righteousness is one unselfishly devoted to that which is right and just. He is not turned away from the path of rectitude, justice and right because of fleshly relationship, either by affinity or by consanguinity. Regardless of who the creature is, if one sees another is right and doing the right thing toward fellow creatures, then that lover of righteousness stands by the side of the one who is right. He does not attempt to justify another’s action because that other is related to him or because he may feel under obligation to one who seeks his approval. The Lord Jesus is the great lover of righteousness among all creatures. All who please Jehovah God must be put to the test, and, if receiving God’s approval, they must show they are lovers of righteousness because God is right, righteous. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">If the parents who are not consecrated to the Lord bring their children to the consecrated for instruction, or if such children come to the company of the consecrated seeking the truth, they should not be turned away, but should be permitted to sit in the meeting with the children of the consecrated and their elders and learn what they can. See to it that the children remain quiet and orderly, and if they ask questions pertaining to the subject matter under consideration, let the one leading give answer in plain, simple phrase. That is exactly what Jesus did. He undoubtedly meant that those who come to him, or to the members of his body, seeking instruction in the truth, should be treated with consideration and helped. If a child is drawn to the Lord or to his people, manifestly this is by God’s grace, and He will provide for them to understand and discern the truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the case of Jesus the fish pictured the grave, where he was fully in the mind of Jehovah God. In the case of the followers of Christ Jesus, the remnant now on earth, the fish pictures God’s provision for their safety in captivity or prison, shielded from the further vicious assaults of the enemy. Jesus could not have been brought out of the grave and again to the land of the living except by exercise of God Almighty’s power, even as God exercised his power to cause the fish to land Jonah. The remnant, restrained or imprisoned, could never have gotten out and again engaged in God’s service except by exercise of his power and loving-kindness toward them. The enemy would have kept God’s people in prison until they died, and that was their purpose. God willed otherwise. God brought them out in the face of all opposition.

<p><span class="font5">Jonadabs have the spirit of Christ in this, that they are devoted to doing God’s will in vindication of his name; but they are not members of the body of Christ, hence not of the “little flock”, but are of the Lord’s &quot;other sheep”. The bodies of such are not accepted for sacrifice and hence are not dead, even though they walk not after the flesh. The spirit of the Lord possessed by Jonadabs, who are consecrated to do God’s will, causes them to live unto righteousness, to seek it, and to do it. They diligently endeavor to do the will of God, which is righteous, and which is a vindication of Jehovah’s name. A human creature that is justified and is offered as a part of the sin offering must be dead to all human hopes and prospects and must be alive in Christ and have his affections set upon heavenly things.

<p><span class="font5">When Jesus died on the tree the ransom price had been provided and made valuable. When Jehovah raised Christ Jesus out of death and exalted him to heaven, and Christ Jesus there in heaven presented the ransom price as a sin offering, there the transaction was completed. From that time forward every one of Adam’s offspring belonged to and is owned by Christ Jesus to be dealt with according to the will of God. It was at that time that Jesus “purchased with his own blood” the offspring of Adam. (Acts 20:28) Was that purchase merely for the purpose of saving men from death? No; that was not the primary purpose. It opened the way for men in due time to obey the Lord and live. It made possible the opportunity for men to prove their integrity toward Jehovah in vindication of his name and prove Satan a liar. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, has given the remnant all his goods, constituting his kingdom interests on earth, and has commanded them to advance the kingdom interests by preaching this gospel of the kingdom for a witness to all nations of earth. The enemy would now drive out Jehovah’s witnesses, that is, the “faithful and wise servant” of the Lord, and prevent them from carrying out the Lord’s commandments, and thus destroy them and cast them out of their possessions, which the Lord has given them. The enemy enters into a conspiracy for that very purpose and proceeds to commit overt acts, in furtherance of that conspiracy, to prevent God’s covenant people from becoming a part of the nation under Christ. (Ps. 83: 2, 3) God has given the faithful followers of Christ Jesus such possessions to inherit, meaning the interest of God’s kingdom in the earth. The faithful become joint-heirs with Christ Jesus in his inheritance. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Today the Jonathan class try to shield Jehovah’s witnesses and warn them of impending danger. Jonathan thus used his arrows as the Jonathan class today use their fighting equipment in aid of Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus they show mutual love for each other and that both are devoted to righteousness. There is now no possibility for the religionist Saul class to repent and turn to God and his King, and there is no further need for the Jonathan and the David class to put forth their efforts in this behalf. The Saul class are bent on destroying Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, just as Saul was bent on destroying David. The war is on now, and the remnant of God’s people on earth must, in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments, go forth and participate in that war.

<p><span class="font5">The number 100 is a multiple of 10 and refers to completeness respecting earthly things. God’s faithful remnant, having maintained their integrity and received his approval, have like the apostle Paul received a favorable judgment at the Lord’s hands and may be said to have completely received everything they can receive while on earth. They know the enemy cannot destroy them; hence there is no sorrow in Zion when one of their number dies and passes on into glory. They are all properly said to be “youths” now within the Scriptural meaning of that word. If, however, any of such willingly becomes a sinner, he shall be accursed and die as such. For him there would be no sorrow, for God has commanded that there shall be no weeping or sorrow for such. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This does not mean Jehovah's witnesses sought pity from the enemy, but that they sought to have a better understanding of God’s will as to what they should do. When danger threatens his people it is his will that they should thus seek his face. The purpose of fasting is to deny oneself of doing what might be to his pleas-sure, in order that he may more fully and efficiently learn the ways and means to serve God. Fasting is not for the purpose of being seen of men or to gain sympathy of men, but rather to boldly take a position before the Lord that would bring reproach upon those who serve God and to deny themselves of any and all things that might interfere with their proper understanding of the Lord’s will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No creature, male or female, shall be permitted to stand in the way of faithful and continuous service to the Lord and his kingdom, and that regardless of the supposed obligation one creature has toward another. Nor shall wicked angels or the Devil himself stop the forward movement of God’s servant. Beset with great persecution and suffering bodily pain, and with death staring him in the face, the servant will not permit any of these things to deter him in his loyal and faithful devotion to the King and kingdom. There is nothing worth while to be compared with the kingdom, and anything presented before the servant and which tends to interfere with his faithful service must be spurned and pushed aside. To everything else he is blind. With him it is the kingdom first, last, and all the time. “This one thing I do.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As the apostle Paul did not need “letters of commendation”, so likewise “The Society”, which operates legally under the name of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, needs no letters of recommendation from any man or men, because it is a part of God’s organization. Its works, together with the results thereof, by the Lord’s grace, viewed in the light of prophecy, are in themselves “letters of commendation” from the Lord himself. Christ Jesus has laid his hands upon “The Society”, even as Paul laid his hands upon Timothy, and so it sets forth the truth in the fulfillment of the prophecies. Also “rebukes” are not now the prerogative of private individuals at the pleasure and choice of such, but such reproof is the prerogative of “The Society” against those who have been entrusted with duties and responsibilities and have proved undependable and unfaithful.

Even now many are coming over to the “feet” members of the Greater David and are making with the anointed a common cause for righteousness, taking their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah and his King. They cannot come with a double or doubtful heart, but must come wholeheartedly, recognizing Christ Jesus as the great anointed King.

<p><span class="font5">Today those whom Jehovah approves as his witnesses are modest, realizing that in themselves there is no strength. Realizing that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are backing them up and fully supporting them, the faithful witnesses of the Lord east aside all fear of man and demons and become bold in the Lord and joyfully declare the message which God has committed to them. Thus they show their love for God and Christ. (1 John 4:17,18) Jehovah then specifically commanded Jeremiah to move forward declaring His judgments against the religionists, the Jews who had forsaken their covenant and had turned to devil worship.

But such distinction is no excuse or justification for the remnant of the little flock to become heady, austere, and to lord it over those of the “other sheep”. “Let no man glory in men,” not even in himself. One who glories in himself or who attempts to lord it over others, boasting of his own position, is a foolish person. True followers of Christ Jesus, who have the witness of the spirit, glory in the Lord: “But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that eommendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord eommendeth.” (1 Cor. 3:21; 2 Cor. 10:17,18) Those of the “other sheep” are the companions of the sheep of the little flock, and the sheep of both flocks must love each other and dwell together in peace and joy.

In his complaining Jonah pictured the disgruntled and peeved ones, and also the religionists of “Christendom” toward whom God is long-suffering and continues to send his witnesses to preach to them that “millions now living will never die” and that such millions will be those who flee to God’s kingdom before Armageddon.

Jesus did not offer the bread and wine to everyone, but only to those who had proved their faithfulness. It follows, then, that only those properly partake of the emblems who are first justified and spirit-begotten, and who are in line for the kingdom. It is the will of God that Jesus shall have associated with him in his work as Vindicator 144,000 members of his body, all together constituting one body or royal house of sons of God and every one of which must undergo a test similar to that to which Jesus was subjected and must suffer and die with Christ Jesus as a condition precedent to entering into glory. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">They receive life as a gift from God by Christ Jesus, and then shall be like all other righteous creatures, because they are “children of God”, that is, “children of the resurrection,” receiving their life from Jehovah as a gift by resurrection through Christ Jesus. They would be like the angels in this, that “they cannot die”; that is, they could not be put to death without God’s approval, even though they are not immortal. They enjoy God’s provision of life because of their faithfulness. Those human creatures will, as individuals, be brought forth, and their course of action will determine their faithfulness, just as the heavenly angels that were brought forth by the Logos and have remained faithful.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from her raging.—Jonah 1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not the judgment of the mariners that they were executing toward Jonah by casting him into the sea; they were doing this as they were commanded, that the will of Jehovah might be done to his own servant. Likewise, it is God’s will that Jonadabs should fully co-operate with Jehovah’s witnesses in entering places of danger to bear the testimony concerning the kingdom. Immediately after casting Jonah into the sea the storm ceased and the sea became calm. The people of good will were in great distress until they saw the Lord’s hand being manifested in these troublesome days, and, seeing their privilege of serving Jehovah, they proceeded to do so by fleeing to God’s organization, and thus they are made glad, and they look forward with hope of being spared during the expression of his wrath at Armageddon and being brought safely into his fold for ever. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Which have the firstfruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.—Rom. 8:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deliverance of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">body of Christ,</span><span class="font5"> that is, “our body,” began in 1918, at the Lord's coming to the temple, when the resurrection took place of those faithful sons who had slept in death until that time. The anointed remnant are now gathered to the temple with the Lord. How do they know? Because they have the witness of the spirit. They know and appreciate that they have been delivered from subjection to human ruling powers, wrongfully called “the higher powers”, and have been delivered from religion and religious formalism, and have been plainly identified as the children of God and members of Christ’s body. Therefore they have quit groaning and entered into the joy of the Lord and rejoice, regardless of their treatment by the agents of Satan.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.—Eph. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the sole purpose of Jesus’ death and resurrection was to save men, then there would have been no occasion to select a special class from among men to bear testimony to Jehovah’s name. The fact that God first selects a people for his name to bear testimony concerning his name and kingdom before others, is conclusive proof that vindication of his name is of far greater importance than salvation of men. Jesus’ apostles were the first to receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice, as evidenced by the outpouring of the holy spirit upon them, and then and there began their work. The apostles are the workmanship of Jehovah, created in Christ Jesus, assigned to a specific good work. All who follow in his footsteps are created in Christ Jesus for a similar good work, and this is of far more importance than mere saving of creatures.

<p><span class="font5">Here Jehoshaphat pictured Christ Jesus standing in the midst of his faithful remnant which he has gathered into the real temple of God. Coming from all quarters of earth, the faithful ones, being gathered to the temple, now stand as a fully united and harmonious company and here they are the “feet of him”, Christ Jesus, and they all look to and pray to Jehovah for protection, guidance and blessing. Jehoshaphat stood “before the new court”, which court foreshadowed the “great multitude”, who there assemble to participate in praising Jehovah and partaking of the feast of tabernacles. This new court pictured a greater space being required for the newcomers, the Jonadabs, and thus the Lord shows an assembling of the remnant and their companions to praise him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Instead of holing themselves up at Jerusalem those faithful Judeans and companions, at the Lord’s command, marched out to meet the enemy and publicly display themselves before the enemy. Jehovah keeps a watch on the enemy and keeps his people sufficiently informed as to the enemy’s movement and purpose. “Jeruel” means “founded (or taught) of God”, or, “fear of God.” What Jehovah brought upon that enemy at that point certainly “taught” them and others the fear of God and founded firmly the faith of those who covenanted to do God’s will and who began to do so. What shall shortly now take place will prove to all that Jehovah is the Almighty God and will certainly teach all to fear him, if they live, and will fully establish their faith in Jehovah as the Mighty One. Thus his name will be put in its proper place. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.—1 Sam. 18:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honest, sincere men love that which is right, regardless of who is involved. The lover of righteousness looks to the right of the matter, being anxious to declare himself on the side of right. Strange as David’s action appeared, there was one man who looked on with unprejudiced mind, and when the fight ended he knew where he stood. That man was Jonathan. The love which instantly sprang into existence was not an expression of affection between two creatures, as between the two sexes, but was a love beyond or “passing the love of women”. Jonathan immediately saw that David was right and was fighting a righteous cause, and that God was with him. He loved David for his righteous work. It was his love for righteousness that was manifested toward David. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When the “new earth” is established and the faithful obedient ones who form the great multitude begin to marry and bring children into the world, will their offspring die as babes in arms ? Those men and women will be counted righteous in God’s sight by reason of their faith in God and in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, and their full devotion to God and his kingdom, and obedience to his law. Therefore their children will not be conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, although they must have the benefit of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus and receive life at the hands of Christ Jesus, “The Everlasting Father.” Why should those children die as suckling babes in arms? What could be the purpose of their being born if they die as such infants? There would then be no cause for them to be sick, pine away and die.

(8:41-43) Note now: In the “eleventh year” after A.D. 1914, or seven years after the Lord Jesus came to the antitypical temple and his beginning then to rear it up, God’s people were assembled in convention at Indianapolis, Indiana, and on August 29, 1925, that assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Message of Hope”, and which was the first and only one of the seven resolutions adopted over a period of seven years that was addressed “To All People of Good Will”. This resolution began to be distributed by the millions of copies all over the earth on Saturday, October 31,1925, or “eighth month”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here is further assurance to the anointed that some of them shall be carried through and remain alive on earth after Armageddon. When that great battle begins, resulting in the slaughter of the religionists, it will proceed to the complete annihilation of all the Devil’s organization. Reference to “the watch tower” emphasizes the fact that at Armageddon the faithful remaining and their other companions who survive will view the great and marvelous aet of Jehovah God performed through Christ Jesus, and that then they shall behold the enemies destroying one another, and being in “the watch tower”, that is, in an exalted position in God’s favor and secure from harm, they will observe his victory to the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.—Ps. 3:8, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has made provision for salvation of human souls. It necessarily follows that there is no other means of salvation. Jehovah does not force salvation upon any creature against his will, but, on the contrary, every human creature that obtains salvation must ask for it and fully agree to the terms which Jehovah has made for his salvation, and must perform those terms. Although Jehovah has made provision for salvation of human souls, their salvation is not his primary purpose. His purpose is the vindication of his name. Salvation of imperfect human creatures is incidental to the vindication of his name. The primary purpose of God he will carry out, because he has so declared. Likewise he will carry out the secondary purpose toward those who conform themselves to his fixed rules. God is no respecter of persons, and each and every one who receives salvation must perform the rules as fixed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The modern-day Philistines, that is, the Communists and anarchists in particular and suchlike radical elements, are against Jehovah’s witnesses, who truly represent God’s kingdom, and they fight against the witnesses, even as the ancient Philistines fought against David, God’s anointed king, and against Jonathan, who stood by David. Today Jehovah’s witnesses, prosecuting their part of the warfare against the antiKingdom, anti-God crowd, do so because they are for Jehovah and his King and for his kingdom under Christ Jesus. It is that kingdom that the modern-day Philistines, that is to say, the religionists, bitterly oppose because the kingdom takes away their own power and standing.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s “other sheep” have sought and found refuge in the Lord’s organization, and they too must be faithful and faithfully give heed to and obey the commandments of God. They must not get out of bounds; which means they must stick close to and remain faithfully devoted to God and his organization under Christ. They are privileged to be the companions of the anointed and to serve with them before the temple of God. They are not to fear men or devils, because by so manifesting fear they would easily be led into the snare of the enemy. They are to seek righteousness by faithfully obeying God’s commandments. They are to seek meekness by being diligent in their efforts to gain knowledge and to grow in wisdom and understanding.

Let them wander up and down [on the streets] formeat [hungry and hunting like dogs, because God has sent a famine among them for hearing his Word] and grudge if they be not satisfied.” (Vss. 14,15) Jehovah’s witnesses know he has promised to exhibit his power when the witness work is done. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/38</span></p>

Religionists, acting as the Devil’s chief instruments, had conspired to put Jehovah’s servants to death, hence 'appointed them to die’. Only a great miracle performed by Jehovah in behalf of Jonah made it possible for him to ever have the privilege of engaging in Jehovah’s service. Likewise Jehovah heard the cry of his people while suffering restraint and imprisonment, and he heard because those prayers were in accord with God’s will to have his name proclaimed throughout the earth before the final expression of his wrath at Armageddon. The faithful servants of God then confessed their own negligence and lawlessness in not boldly declaring the truth amidst great opposition.—Isa. 6:7.

<p><span class="font5">The joy of the Lord means to earnestly look forward to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and to have some part therein by maintaining integrity toward God under all conditions and by seeing other human creatures prove their faithful devotion to God, and thereby prove Satan to be a liar. With joy of the Lord such faithful ones endure hardness and suffer, and they are determined that, come what may, they will serve God and his King faithfully to the end. But a contrary class find no joy in the Lord, because they do not appreciate the meaning of the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Selfishly they look for their own ease, comfort, reputation and honor. They do not rejoice that the Lord’s “other sheep” are fleeing to his fold and that this will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name.

Some of the individual members of the little flock may by reason of physical weakness or like hindrances be handicapped or limited in their service, but each one must be faithful to the Lord in doing what he can do to perform his covenant. He must not be governed or discouraged by physical weakness, sickness or disabilities of organism, but must hold fast with confidence to the Lord and continue to rejoice in hope of being with him, and that even Tinto the end. He must be governed or controlled in his action by the witness of the spirit, and not by temporary passion or feeling.

<p><span class="font5">It is certain that the faithful mother and grandmother, in teaching the child Timothy, did not use baby talk, nor resort to some so-called “primer instruction” written about the Bible, such as would-be teachers do in the present day. They instructed the lad out of the inspired Holy Scriptures and showed him the law and the prophets, testifying concerning Jesus Christ and his kingdom. Their faithful work resulted in splendid spiritual fruit. Timothy was quite a young man when Paul chose him as an assistant in the Lord’s work. The parent who has covenanted to serve God cannot shirk the responsibility of teaching his child by pushing it off onto the company or individuals of the company of God’s consecrated people. All scriptures support that conclusion. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The matter of understanding the testimony is not left just to us (the spirit-begotten) or anything within us, to determine or prove we are the sons of God, such as our outward feelings, sentiments or emotions. Such things could not be depended upon, because too changeable. God’s spirit or holy power, invisible to human eyes, is not sentimentality, nor subject to change, nor to anything that may affect our health, feelings or mental state. At the same time that the “spirit of adoption” is sent into the heart of the consecrated, spirit-begotten one, that same one receiving it begins to have the witness of the holy spirit that he is Good’s son, and he cries “Abba, Father”, thus appreciating that the relationship of son to Father exists. One who does not occupy that relationship of a spiritual son to Almighty God could not have the witness of the spirit above mentioned. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/38</span></p>

That means that there must be full and complete unity in action on the part of the anointed. The Lord’s organization is not divided. There can be no dispute or confusion among those who are in Christ and therefore in the temple. Those who show a disposition to cause trouble or divisions, or who murmur and complain against the manner of doing the Lord’s work, are certain to be cast away.

<p><span class="font5">In the year 1919 Jehovah’s remnant people now on earth were restored from the Devil’s captivity and thereafter resumed their activities in the Lord’s service by fearlessly advertising the King and his kingdom, and now these are dwelling in the kingdom of the Lord. Then the Lord builded up Zion, the dwelling place of God, and which Christ Jesus builded upon himself as Chief Foundation Stone, by raising out of the sleep of death the faithful ones, and then by judging and bringing the approved ones yet on earth into the temple, all being stones in the living temple of God. Jehovah’s name is called upon that sanctuary or temple company, thus proving that the remnant now on earth must publish Jehovah’s name, being his select witnesses for that very purpose. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Ignorance of God’s law is cause for extending mercy. Knowledge increases one’s responsibility. Divine mercy cannot be taught by any creature’s labors, but it proceeds from love of God. The faithful remnant are grateful for God’s mercy shown to them, and they delight to obey his commands and in mercy to carry his message and his name to all those of good will toward God. They rejoice that God has permitted them to remain on earth and be his witnesses, and are not at all concerned about how long they must remain on earth and continue in his work here. With them the doing of God’s will is all-important. To the merciful God extends mercy, but to those who have had opportunity to know better and who have disregarded the Lord’s favor and turned against him and refused to carry the message of mercy and comfort to the antitypieal Ninevites, toward them his judgment is executed without further mercy.

Consequently the words “and thou king Jehoshaphat” take in everyone who has an ear to hear. The Israelites were there standing, anxiously and breathlessly waiting for Jehovah to answer their cry and the prayer uttered by Jehoshaphat. Today all those on earth who are now fully devoted to Jehovah and who see the combined enemy, armed to the teeth; approaching to the final assault, stand anxiously and breathlessly waiting the instruction from the throne of the Most High, and they are eager to obey that instruction.

This does not mean that none of the “great multitude” or Jonathan class will survive Armageddon; but rather that some of the Jonathan class may die, while others survive. Rather this part of the picture shows that the Jonathan class must, if called upon to do so, show their faithfulness even unto death. They are not “a less faithful class”, as has been said, but must and do possess the faith like unto the members of God's royal house. They cannot take a compromising position, but must be wholly for Jehovah and his kingdom. Jonathan died faithful to Jehovah and to his beloved friend, David, even as he worked for the defense of David, and his righteous cause. Jonathan saw David was God’s choice and he remained true.

This duty does not devolve upon individuals or congregations acting independently and democratically.

God’s law specifically designates the time and conditions under which beasts may be killed and the purpose for which they may. The man who fails or refuses to regard the life of his beast is unrighteous in God’s sight. The fact that his beast cannot speak is no excuse to ill-treat it, much less to take its life. (Prov. 12:10) If man requires a beast for food he may rightfully slay it and eat its flesh; but he must not eat the blood. The life of all earthly creatures is in the blood. Since life belongs to Jehovah his law requires that even when a beast is taken for food its lifeblood must be poured out to the Lord. To kill animals for mere sport, and not for food, is certainly a violation of God’s law, hence of the everlasting covenant. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Jer. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has commissioned his people in Christ who are working with Christ and under his immediate command to build and to plant. To them today Jehovah says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isa. 51:16; Jer. 1: 9) The work of Christ Jesus now, and in which his faithful followers are permitted to have part, is tearing down the strongholds of the wicked one and his wicked servants, and at the same time erecting a lasting habitation for the abiding place of the peoples and inviting those of good will to enter and partake of its blessings, without money and price.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus gave his life a ransom for as many of the human race as will comply with the conditions by believing and obeying as commanded. The obedient ones of the human race are designated under the symbol of “sheep”, and concerning which Jesus said: “I lay down my life for the sheep.” (John 10:15) The disobedient ones are designated under the symbol of “goats”. Did not Jesus also lay down his life for the “goats”? He did not, for the reason that the ransom sacrifice is not provided for the disobedient, but only for the obedient ones; as it is written: “He that be-lieveth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:36. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3 JI J38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.—Jonah 4:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The selfish class pictured by Jonah had been shown God’s mercy. Claiming to be spirit-begotten, they concluded that if they should be found to be only partially faithful, certainly they would land in the “great multitude”; and therefore they rested on their oars. They took it easy, and some continue to do so. But that supposed spiritual net disappeared in 1935: it was a mere myth. The Lord made it known that there is no Scriptural authority for claiming a secondary, halfway-faithful spiritual class, but that the great multitude is made of the “other sheep” of the Lord, and that their hope is earthly, and that they must prove the same kind of zeal and faithfulness as that exhibited by the spiritual class that is saved. In 1935, when the Lord revealed the true situation of the great multitude, the antitypical gourd withered for the mur-murers.

<p><span class="font5">Upon that condition does the spirit continue to bear witness to those begotten of the spirit. The body members will be glorified together with Christ Jesus, because such is the promise of Jehovah. But they that receive such glory must perform the conditions imposed upon them prior to entering into it. Jehovah, Christ Jesus, and all the body members are subjected to a like reproach at the enemy’s hands. Necessarily all members of the royal house must prove their integrity toward Jehovah and must participate in the vindication of his name; therefore, of necessity, they will suffer persecution at the hands of Satan and his agents. Those of the little flock could not be made perfect without suffering with Christ. Participating in such suffering is what constitutes a part of the witness of the spirit.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection . . . are the children of God.—Luke 20:35,36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful men, from Abel to John the Baptist, endured all manner of suffering, “not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.” Those “accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead” cannot mean merely those who may be awakened out of death and live for a few years. That world is the “world without end”. (Eph. 3:21) Those “children of the resurrection”, who are counted “worthy to obtain that world”, must of necessity stand a test and prove their integrity before counted worthy, for such is God’s rule, that all must be tested, and God does not change his rules. Such test will be applied to every creature on earth and will manifest who are the faithful and true ones and who shall live for ever, and also make manifest those who will be deceived by the Devil and go into destruction.—Rev. 20:7-9.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nineveh shall be overthrown.—Jonah 3:</span><span class="font5">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark that Jonah did not ask permission of the police commissioner, the policemen, nor even the king, that he might there declare God’s vengeance against the city, nor did he submit his speech to the clergy to have them censor it that it might not shock their religious susceptibilities. He was there to obey God’s command; and in this he pictured those zealous souls who obey Jehovah without reference to what men may think or say. He told the people of Nineveh that within a definite time it would be overthrown. In the antitype the Lord’s message has fixed a definite time when &quot;Christendom” shall be overthrown. That time is at Armageddon. The real power of the message delivered is that, when the witness work in the name of Jehovah is completed, then “Christendom” and all of Satan’s organization shall be destroyed.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.—Rom. 8:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the time when the spiritual class realized that they were taken to the temple and anointed they were fearful. They were brought under the yoke of bondage to religious forms, ceremonies and requirements, and therefore were enslaved unto selfish creatures, such as clergy and elective elders, by reason of their fear of traditions brought about by the Devil. But now they have a Godly fear and have been anointed and illuminated, and they joyfully cry “Abba, Father”. Jonadabs also have that sonly feeling, attitude, regard toward God. They pray the prayer Jesus taught his disciples and address Jehovah as Father. They do so because there is before them the prospect of being fully brought into the fold of God and hence of becoming his earthly sons.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.—Dan. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of the cleansing of the temple upon the coming of the Lord Jesus was that the approved ones might be assigned to the duty for which they were selected and thereafter offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. (Mal. 3:3) The cleansing of such men was to free them from religion and make such the witnesses to the name of the Almighty God who shall continually proclaim his praises and speak of his glory. From Pentecost forward the work first in importance and time was the selection of a people for Jehovah’s name. Those taken out for his name must first receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice resulting to them by reason of faith in and confession of Jesus Christ and of their obedience to his commandments. Merely believing and openly confessing that Christ Jesus is the Son of God is not sufficient. Progress must be made to the point of proving one’s integrity toward God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.—2 Chron. 20:13. </span><span class="font5">There they stood before the temple, hence before Jehovah. It was a helpless and needy company. “Their wives” were the weaker than the fighting men, and were very anxiously watching and waiting upon the Lord. They did not picture the females of the church, but did picture those weaker than others in the Lord, yet who are prospective heirs of the kingdom. (1 Pet. 3:7) “And their children,” that is, (literally) “builders” of the family, the young who were under age and upon whom the fathers in Israel depended to keep the name of Israel alive. The faithful people of good will now on earth, and who stand with the Lord’s anointed ones, are in fact “builders” who, by God’s grace being taken through the great conflict at Armageddon, will make the name of Jehovah and his King to rem</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain </span><span class="font5">alive in the earth.

<p><span class="font5">The king’s words indicate there were “strangers” within the city gates who heard Jehoshaphat. Those strangers would picture the present-day people of good will, the “other sheep”, who now hear and give heed to the Lord’s words. The day of battle is near and, in harmony with the Scripture admonition, those of the temple company should now be “exhorting one another: and so much the more as ye see the day approaching”. Each should be encouraging the others and pointing to the fact that the kingdom is the only thing worth while and for them to share in it they must be faithful and true to Jehovah now. We know the battle of the great day is near; therefore it is the duty of every one of the remnant to exhort his brethren to watchfulness and faithfulness.

<p><span class="font5">The love of the Jonathan class is primarily for Christ Jesus, the Greater David, the Savior and Deliverer of mankind. Observing the boldness and sincerity of God’s remnant people engaging in his “strange work” and thus manifesting the spirit of Christ Jesus, the Jonathan class love the David class or remnant with a pure heart fervently. Like Jonathan, when the “other sheep” learned the true identity of the remnant and their own identity and relationship to the remnant, they sought companionship with the remnant. From that time onward they are real companions, knit together in unselfish devotion to righteousness and to all who love righteousness. Thus is seen why they love each other dearly and stand shoulder to shoulder fighting for the cause of righteousness under Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/38</span></p>

Following Armageddon they will proceed to marry and carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. From that time forward babies shall be born. The kingdom then in full operation, There shall nothing hurt nor destroy.’ (Isa. 11: 8, 9) There would then appear to be no cause for babies to be-sick, pine away and die. If they die as suckling babes, the sting of death would still be extant and bring great sorrow on the parents. But the end of the babe a few days old shall not come. The baby shall continue to live and grow up to an age of individual responsibility. If it is properly taught and gives heed, it will learn to love and serve the King and Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">“Ordained” as used by religionists is in the nature of a claim that there exists in God’s organization an arrangement called “orders”, and that the persons assigned to such “orders” are superior to and in a different class from others of the church. According to the Scriptures the word there translated “ordain” means “appoint, designate, constitute and set in order”, but never means rank or class distinction. “Ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Gal. 3:28) God hath set the members in the body as it pleaseth him. (1 Cor. 12:18) In the body of Christ there are no such “orders”. Different ones in the company perform different functions in Christ’s body. There are many members, but one body. (1 Cor. 12:20) One member of the body does not perform all the functions of the body of Christ, but all are on the same level.

<p><span class="font5">The Devil’s visible forces become a spoil to Jehovah’s people; what the religionists forfeit God’s people, by being faithful, gain: “The wicked shall be a ransom [price] for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.” (Prov. 21:18) The wicked religionists, by reason of their wickedness, lose all, and this results beneficially to the righteous, because the righteous gain everything at Jehovah’s hands. His triumph over the enemy and the privilege given to his faithful people to see and be identified as having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and be preserved by his power for his further service to the glory of his name, will be lasting, durable riches to them, treasures in heaven. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This picture shows men coming to Jesus and in effect saying to him, We believe you are the Savior of men, and we ask you to buy us and give us the bread of life, that we may live.’ Joseph did not buy everyone in Egypt whether he wanted to be bought or not. Likewise Jesus does not buy everyone whether he wishes to be bought or not, but buys those who come to him and ask to be bought. It is therefore specifically written concerning those received by him and begotten of the spirit: “Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price.” (1 Cor. 6:19,20) No man can receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice unless he desires and asks for it and then complies with the rules.

<p><span class="font5">The fact that Jesus invited or commanded his disciples to drink of it is conclusive proof that all who are in that covenant, and no others, must drink of his blood. It is true that his lifeblood is for remission of sins; but no one will be invited into the covenant and thus be taken out of the world as for the name of Jehovah until that one first believes on and accepts the Lord Jesus Christ and his precious blood as his means of salvation. The faithful disciples had previously accepted Jesus as Messiah; and when the purchase price was presented in heaven as a sin offering they became the spiritual sons of God. Jesus did not invite all Israelites to partake of the Memorial emblems, but only those faithful men who had proved their integrity toward him.

<p><span class="font5">Suffering results to all of God’s sheep, because they are opposed by the Devil. Christ Jesus is the author of salvation to all that obey him, some of whom are made perfect on earth, and some perfected in heaven, and all must suffer at the hands of the enemy, and do so suffer. God marks out the steps that must be taken by his spiritual sons, and Christ Jesus has led and blazed the way that all such must travel. Jonadabs are not conformed to the image of the likeness of Christ Jesus. They are not of <sup>f</sup>the seed of Abraham according to the promise’, because they are not justified by faith and are not baptized into the death of Christ. (Gal. 3: 7-29) Jonadabs must learn obedience by the things which they suffer for righteousness’ sake, because they cannot learn it in any other way. Such is a condition put on them of faithfulness to God under stress. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Devil at that time will see the earth filled with righteous human creatures in obedience to the divine mandate, and which then will be proof that the Devil himself is a liar; and he will know it. “The saints,” that is, those who maintain their integrity toward God and who are granted life everlasting, will be a vindication of Jehovah’s word and name. Surely the offspring of the “great multitude” must be put to this test, even as the spirit-begotten ones are now put to a like test. (Col. 2:8) Will some of the offspring of the righteous great multitude fall under that test? Such is entirely probable. As to babes and others who died ignorant of God’s provision and who are awakened and judged, it is certain many such will be deceived. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “faithful and wise servant” appreciates that the earthly interests of the kingdom are now committed into their hands and it is their great privilege to put forth every possible effort to advance those kingdom interests. While they see that salvation to everlasting life is the greatest blessing that can come to an individual creature, they can also clearly discern that the paramount purpose of the kingdom is to convince all creation of the majesty, glory and supremacy of Jehovah and that their own faithfulness in giving closest attention to the “goods” committed to them fully insures their having a part in the vindication of the name of the Most High. Therefore the kingdom is of the greatest importance.

They must learn that consecration and sanctification are required of each one who shall become part of the great multitude and live on earth and carry into effect the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people. Everyone who receives benefit of the ransom and obtains salvation must perform the conditions. Such must become the voluntary servants of the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Since being gathered to the temple all are taught of God by Christ Jesus. The light of Jehovah shining upon the Head of the temple is reflected upon all the temple members, and thus their knowledge has increased. Such increase is given that they may be equipped for a great and good work, which means full and complete unity in action. The chief part of their equipment has been furnished them since being gathered to the temple. That equipment is not for the purpose of providing a condition or place of rest in idleness, but that all the temple company may be engaged in the work of carrying out the purpose for which they were selected. Since they are the ones taken out for Jehovah’s name, then it is certain that their work is that of making proclamation of his name, which must be done immediately before Armageddon.

A few individuals of Israel obeyed God, and to them was given the privilege of becoming part of the new heavens. Those and others thereafter taken out from among men, and who prove their integrity by faithful obedience, do become a peculiar treasure to the Lord. (1 Pet. 2:9) These are called forth to show forth praises of Jehovah, and not the praises of any man, and all such must be obedient to the Lord’s commandments, and therefore must bear witness to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom, and proclaim his name and sing his praises throughout the earth.

Righteousness shall be the urging, driving, impelling force in the Lord’s organization now on earth, and this particularly so since the cleansing of his sanctuary in 1932. “Righteousness” would therefore mean that there could be no more oppression such as practiced by “elective elder” bosses, who feel and manifest their importance and browbeat others. There must be no more misguided efforts in wrong directions, such as character development, kowtowing to would-be higher powers of the world, adulation of individuals or creatures, and therefore ‘no longer the rod of the wicked resting on [and ruling over] the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hand unto iniquity’. —Ps. 125: 3. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/38</span></p>

Jehovah foretold that the enemy assault would cause the remnant to “cry unto thee in our affliction”; and they do this in the very day where we now are. The remnant do not belittle the enemy, but correctly estimate the strength of their enemies. They confess their own helpless impotence and that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are their sole protection and strength and salvation. Although their cry is painful and they suffer great pain and mental anguish, they are full of confidence in Jehovah and are determined to hold fast their integrity toward him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While engaged in the “strange work”, which Jehovah is carrying forward with his people, the anointed and their companions must and will suffer many hardships and persecutions. While they are undergoing such trying conditions, they must feed their minds upon the record of God’s Word, which he has made for their strength and comfort. No one of the temple anointed company can now stand alone and in his own strength. All of the temple company must stand together in the Lord Jesus Christ, fully supporting one another. Not even the anointed can understand these things, which are written for their comfort, unless they ‘study to show themselves approved unto God’, that is, study his Word and the revelation thereof, which he is now bringing to pass to enlighten and strengthen those that love and serve him.

Certainly not by following error and practicing religion. The fact that Jesus died to provide a redemptive price for the benefit of sinners does not automatically release men from sin’s effects. Something must be done by the creature before he can receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. One who believes on the Lord must then study God’s Word of truth and deport himself according to that truth. The Bible, which contains God’s Word of truth, is provided for the benefit of men now on earth, and those who would receive salvation must study it and find out what is the will of God concerning them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Accusations of wrongdoing should never be made to the Society unless the charge is well known to be true and the proof thereof clear, cogent and convincing. The Society’s reply would properly be made based on the truth of the case and, assuming that the charges are true, the wrong act would be condemned without condemning the person, and this would be done only to safeguard the general interest of the kingdom. Love of the brethren must prevail. Consequently nothing should ever be done by the anointed to work injury to his brethren. Approval or disapproval of men is not material, but the interest of the Lord’s organization is vitally material, and only those who look well to such kingdom interests should expect to receive approval. The anointed members of the temple will diligently avoid controversies with others, and hence among those who associate with them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These words were full assurance that the approaching battle was not a curse from God upon his covenant people, and therefore not for their punishment. The enemy is not marching at the behest or will of Jehovah to punish the people of the Lord, but it is the will of the Almighty that the battle shall take place expressly for the destruction of the enemy. It is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and shall be a vindication of his name. Today the sanctuary of the Lord is cleansed and all of the temple company are one, and therefore “there shall be no more curse” from Jehovah upon his faithful people. Because it is the battle of Almighty God he is now maneuvering the enemy forces and leading them into a trap into which they are certain to fall, resulting in the complete destruction of the Lord’s enemies.

<p><span class="font5">All of Zion behold the glory of God, and proclaim the praises of his name, and not the praises of creatures. They do not sing the praises of men or any man, or themselves seek honor of men, because they know that their privilege and duty is to show forth Jehovah’s praises. (1 Pet. 2:9) “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 29: 9) This the temple members do by obeying the Lord’s commandment to serve as his witnesses, to magnify his name and to inform the people that all who would find the way to life must faithfully serve God and Christ Jesus. Satan and his angels no more have access to the heavens, they having been cast down to the earth. And now Christ Jesus, the righteous overlord, in obedience to God’s will, has gathered unto himself his faithful ones, and the new heavens are created and complete. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In other phrase, Jehovah says: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> magnify my mercy by sparing the people of good will in ‘Christendom’ and furnishing them an opportunity to repent, because they were once wholly ignorant.” “Christendom” is far more reprehensible than those who have been kept in ignorance of the Word of God; and now, just preceding the destruction of “Christendom” in the battle of the great day of God Almighty, Jehovah sends his witnesses, pictured by Jonah, to give warning to “Christendom”. One of the chief purposes of this warning is that those who have been blinded and kept in ignorance may learn of the right way, take their stand on God’s side, and find protection there. Such is great mercy toward them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Everyone who makes an unconditional consecration to do God’s will properly symbolizes or gives outward testimony of it by being baptized in water. That baptism, however, does not put him into the body of Christ; he must be baptized into the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, and that must be done after he has consecrated himself to God and received justification. “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.” Only those called to the heavenly calling share in his death.

<p><span class="font5">“The spirit” manifestly means the holy, invisible power of God proceeding from and acting for and representing God, the great Spirit, being by and through the Lord Jesus Christ, “that Spirit.” “The spirit” more specifically therefore means “the comforter”, “the spirit of truth,” which was promised by the Lord Jesus Christ. Continuing to act in that capacity, and serving till Christ Jesus should return and come to the temple and gather unto himself the little flock, the comforter was sent and performed the function assigned by Jehovah. Christ Jesus did return and come to the temple in 1918. Since that time, the Lord being with his own people at the temple, there is a more direct operation of the Lord toward them by illuminating the minds of the anointed temple company with understanding and appreciation of prophecy. This God does by and through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All share in one general fulfillment of the commission God has given to the remnant, but necessarily there are different places of service in the theocratic government. Offices or titles are nothing, because the service can be performed in one name as well as in another. The Head, Christ Jesus, properly bears any and all titles. He shows his complete submission to the great Theocrat, - and joyfully bears the name ‘elect servant’, “my servant.” The remnant constitute the “feet of him”; therefore all are properly called servants. In harmony therewith the Society in the recent past has designated all in the organization as “servants”, and that without reference to the place one fills. Assignment and designation of one in a certain place means he is assigned to certain duties within a restricted area, and all servants are working harmoniously to one end. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jonathan loved David more than he loved Saul, because he knew that David was God’s favored one and that David represented the righteous cause. Today the Jonathan class love the remnant, the “feet of him”, Christ Jesus, far more than they do the religionists, because they know that the remnant represents on earth the great and righteous ruler, Christ Jesus. The breach between the Jonathan class and the Saul class today continues to widen. All those on the side of Christ the King must now stand firmly together, showing mutual love toward one another and harmoniously serving together, and in doing this they of necessity must oppose the Saul class, and do oppose religionists. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s irreproachable and holy name is upon his temple and is tied in with his witnesses and his name must now be vindicated and avenged upon his combined enemies. Jehovah God is long-suffering with his enemies, and he permits them to press down upon his people that the anointed may have opportunity to prove their integrity and to thereby prove Satan a liar. In God’s own time he will avenge his elect servants as he has promised. “But when the Son of man comes, will be find this belief on the land?” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Diag.) </span><span class="font5">According to your faith be it unto you.

<p><span class="font5">A failure to believe would result in the very opposite, and they would , not be permanently established in God’s organization. Those that believe Jehovah and prove their belief by faithfully serving him in obedience to his commandment abide in his organization for ever. To believe means to obey; and by no other means can one prove his belief. In order to believe, within the meaning of the Scriptures, each one must keep in mind God’s promise and have his mind fixed upon the kingdom, because the kingdom is the only thing worthy of consideration. That means to have fully at heart the kingdom interests, and an honest and sincere effort put forth to safeguard and advance the kingdom interests, by learning and doing God’s will.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord has his organization on earth acting under his command and doing his work. That organization belongs to no man, and hence is under the control of no man or men. No man can remain in the organization of the Lord unless that man is induced by an unselfish motive to serve God. There could be no trouble, discord and strife among the truly anointed ones, because those commissioned to do God’s work today delight to do his will and hence are at all times in unity. Selfishness is the moving cause for strife, and the strifemakers are ambitious and not of the temple company. Some of such may once have been admitted to the temple, but, if so, they could not remain there and at the same time be strifebreeders. Troublemakers are offended at the Lord’s manner of carrying on his work. If they were pleased with the Lord’s work and pleased to have a part therein, they could never even countenance trouble.

That will be such a marvelous time of blessing and joy that human tongues cannot find or utter words sufficiently to praise Jehovah’s name. They will adore him and his great Vindicator, Christ Jesus. It is then that the will of God will begin to be done on the earth as in heaven. It is reasonable to expect that Jehoshaphat, the one-time king of Judea, will have been awakened out of death by that time and will join the others on that grand occasion of praising Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The present-day situation intensifies the responsibility resting upon those of God’s remnant and their companions, who have been enlightened by the truth and have undertaken to serve God and his King. The people who have been long held in bondage to religious traditions are in danger of certain destruction. It is God’s will that they be warned. Proclaiming the kingdom gospel is for a witness to the people, and those to whom this gospel has been committed must be diligent in obeying the commandment to preach it now. It will not do to wait until after Armageddon to give the warning, because then it will be too late. The “strange work” of the Lord must be completed before Armageddon, and that “strange work” is to proclaim the truth against all forms of religion and to make known to the people that all salvation is of Jehovah through Christ Jesus his King.

The faithful have the joy of the Lord; well do they know that all things concerning them shall work together for their good. They rejoice continually and delight to serve wheresoever they are put. They know that the Devil and his agents cannot destroy them, and cannot even kill them, except by God’s permission, and, if they continue faithful unto death, their resurrection to eternal life and glory will be instantaneous. They now have a vision of the new heavens and the new earth, and they rejoice, and their exultation shall be perpetual in the creation of God and because of the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/98</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jonathan readily discerned that David was God’s choice and that he must love David and support him faithfully. Jonathan, by bestowing his garments and his war equipment upon David, assigns to him royal honors, recognizing him as higher than Jonathan. Likewise the &quot;other sheep” now place themselves and their equipment at the disposal of Christ Jesus for the service of God and lend full co-operation to the manner of service carried on under Christ Jesus’ directions. Only those who have the spirit of Jonathan enter into a cove--nant to serve the Lord and therefore break away from religionists and devote themselves to the David class.

<p><span class="font5">While Christ Jesus was in the tomb he was dead and could not pray. Therefore this part of the prophecy does not refer to Jesus. It does, however, apply to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who were in captivity or in prison during the World War. Like Jonah, they prayed and cried unto God that they might be released and again given opportunity to serve him, and Jehovah heard those prayers. Many days thereafter Jehovah revealed to his people how he miraculously dealt with them and protected them from the enemy, the raging waves of the sea. Their restraint or imprisonment during that period doubtless caused their preservation and saved them from death at the hands of the enemy.

<p><span class="font5">To assault or vilify one who is serving the Lord, in an attempt to destroy the value of that servant's work, means nothing less than judging God's servant and fighting against God and opposing his kingdom. The religious clergy and the “evil servant” together constitute the “man of sin”, and Jehovah in his Word serves notice upon them that they are servants of the Devil, that they are fighting against God, and that their station and end shall be the same as that of the Devil. The efforts of the “man of sin” shall not retard the onward march of God's kingdom. Those who oppose the work in any manner, whether by assaulting God’s servant class or by themselves showing selfishness and a peeved and sulky attitude and refusing to engage in God’s service, are thereby opposing God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/38</span></p>

This poured-out blood represents my life poured out in death, even as my broken body shows that I must die, and if you share with me in my kingdom you must share with me in my death. Eat therefore of this bread and drink of this blood.’ Jesus knew drinking the blood meant death, as the law of Jehovah provided. (Lev. 17:11) He was therefore inviting his disciples to perform an act that meant their death, and thus inviting them to participate in his death. Hence he said: “He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.” That is the only way to be taken into The Christ.

Nor may Jonadabs “live after the flesh”, that is, according to the law of sin and death, which, as Paul stated, “is in my members,” or by doing the works of the flesh. (Rom. 7: 23; Gal. 5:19-21) But Jonadabs, as well as the anointed, may, with the help of God’s spirit, put to death the deeds of the flesh, that is, the inherited body of sin, and to which said body is committed. The Jonadabs must live, not in heaven, but forever on the earth, whereas the anointed little flock sacrifice everything earthly and their lives are hid in Christ and they must live, if at all, in heaven.

Such hope means that the consecrated ones with great pleasure and joy look forward to and expect in God’s time to receive a heavenly place with Christ Jesus the King. Like him, those who have the hope of being with him in that kingdom must be blind to everything else and refuse to compromise with or let anything of the Devil’s organization or this world interfere with full performance of duty and obligation, which the Lord lays on those running for the prize of the high calling. If one has that hope and his expectation is that he will be for ever with Christ in heaven, then he must be dead to everything earthly. Such is the hope of the “little flock”.

The temple company members must of necessity be, and are, at full unity with the Lord and with one another.

God’s people are to believe Jehovah’s prophets. The prophecies and their meaning the Lord at the temple now reveals to his people. This he does through his channel of communication.

God had told his covenant people to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, and now there they stood still at the watch tower, viewing the carnage wrought by the Lord. Likewise Jehovah will fight for his people at Armageddon, and they will be delivered and be entirely safe. What a terrific sight that will be to the eyes of the survivors whom God will bring through the terrible conflict, that is, the remnant and the great multitude, among whom will doubtless be some of the faithful prophets who recorded these things.

They perish in the battle of the great day of God Almighty after they have assaulted God’s faithful people. In their plans to rule the world, as set forth now by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in combine with Fascism, they leave God out of their consideration altogether, and thus they constitute “all the nations that forget God”. The totalitarian rule or dictatorial power is now arising with great flare of trumpets. Now the needy and poor are regimented and their rights taken away and they are forgotten. Therefore the prophet, representing God’s people, prays: “Arise, 0 Lord; let not man prevail.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.—Heb. 5:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What good resulted to Jesus from his suffering? He learned obedience by the things he suffered. It was necessary for him to be obedient to God’s commandment, regardless of all persecution and opposition, and such was necessary in order that he might maintain his integrity; and this he did. Thus is God’s unchangeable rule again proved: that obedience is absolutely essential on the part of everyone that lives, and that God rewards the faithfully obedient ones. Such do not seek approval of men, but do faithfully perform assigned duties as servants of Jehovah God. This Jesus did at all times. He sought only the approval of his Father, and Jehovah rewarded him above all other creatures of the universe. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.—Eph. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has provided for man’s salvation, not just for their benefit, but for his own name’s sake. If God forced salvation upon men or provided for their automatic salvation through benefit of the ransom, that would not sustain his good name, but would be merely an exhibition of his power. God could have so made Adam that he could not sin; but He did not do that. He gave Adam a choice of obedience and life or lawlessness and death. Adam chose the latter and died, and must remain in that condition. Could Jehovah put on earth men who under test would remain true and faithful to him? That is the issue. God will prove beyond all doubt that he can do so. He makes provision for Christ Jesus to buy mankind, and he offers man salvation. Those who comply with the divine rules shall live, because they prove their integrity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fear not them which kill the body.—Matt. 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Urijah, fearing that the religionists would kill him, fled to Egypt; but he was brought back and put to death. (Jer. 26: 20-24) The fact that Urijah had been put to death did not deter Jeremiah. Instead of showing fear and fleeing to some other part of the Devil’s organization, he stood up before his accusers and said to them: ‘I have delivered the message God sent me to deliver. Now do what you will.’ Urijah sought protection in the Devil’s organization, and died as a result. Jeremiah put his trust wholly in God, and was spared. There was set a precedent by which God’s people must now be guided. Their protection and salvation is to be found only in God’s organization under Christ Jesus, and for anyone to seek other means of safety shows lack of faith in God. When we have a duty to perform, we should perform it without fear of man or devil. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, go to Nineveh, . . . But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tdrshish, from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa.—Jonah 1:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonah’s action cannot be construed as meaning he forsook God and desired to take up a form of heathen worship. It was manifestly the commission God had placed upon him that he did not want to obey, and that for fear of what men might say about him. Here is a clear ease in which man leaned to his own understanding and did not trust and acknowledge Jehovah. The proverb states that the fear of man leads one into the snare of the Devil. When one undertakes to serve the Lord, and then hesitates, fails or refuses to do so because of fear of what man might do to him or what might befall him from men by reason of his faithful service, such a one is absolutely certain to get himself into a bad position. The Lord made this clear in the picture, and now reveals it that his people may be instructed fully in the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But I will sacrifice, unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed,. Salvation is of the Lord.-—Jonah 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For Jonah that meant he must go to Nineveh and cry against it. For Jehovah’s faithful witnesses now on earth it means that they must no longer be held back by fear of Satan or of-any of his agencies, but that they take up with renewed zeal and energy the preaching of &quot;this gospel of the kingdom” and declare the “day of vengeance of our God”, and that they do this regardless of the approval or disapproval of men, that they obey God in the face of all opposition. To the faithful ones “salvation is of the Lord”. The salvation of Jonah from the belly of the fish came and could come only from Jehovah. Likewise the salvation of those who turn to God can come from him, and from no other source. This truth must be presented to the “other sheep”, which form the great multitude.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.—Luke 15:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “faithful and wise servant” or remnant proclaim the truths within the hearing of sinners, and rejoice to do so because it is God’s will. Hearing the Lord’s message, people of. good will come from every land and clime, inquiring the way to God’s kingdom, and these soon form the great multitude. The faithful witnesses of the Lord rejoice to go through much tribulation and hardship to carry the truth to the great multitude, and they do so faithfully and gladly. Murmurers and com-plainers denounce the Lord’s servants because they proclaim the truth to sinners. They are in fact offended against God because he causes his mercy to be exhibited through Christ to others, namely, people of good will. They want to be the only ones in the light of God’s favor.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.—John 6:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His human life Jesus gives for the redemptive price of the world. All who receive the benefit thereof must believe on him as the Savior of the world. Such faith must be exhibited before one is justified. The words of Jesus to his disciples concerning the breaking of bread mean an entirely different thing. Jesus took the loaf of unleavened bread and broke it and said to his followers: “This is my body.” His words were in substance these: ‘You must eat, that is, you must partake with me and thereby become my partners or fellowsufferers, and as this bread you see me break represents the body of Christ, or the members, all of such must be broken together.’ Such breaking of the bread or body must take place after those partaking are justified and spirit-begotten. Therefore only such properly partake of the Memorial emblems. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.—Rom. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was strictly true and limited to the spirit-begotten ones before the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918 and before Christ Jesus began bringing in his “other sheep”, who shall form the great multitude. Although Jonadabs must now follow the lead of the Lord’s spirit, yet they are not begotten of God as his sons. They have not been acknowledged by Jehovah as his sons. They are in line for sonship on the earth ultimately, as Adam was at his creation and before he sinned. The anointed, however, have been ‘begotten again unto a living hope’. Concerning such spirit-begotten ones it is written: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God.” Those of the “little flock” become sons of God from the time they are begotten. Those of the great multitude will be earthly sons of God only after they are given everlasting life on earth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/38 The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 8:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one could have that testimony except the spirit-begotten ones. What is “our spirit” ? It is that invisible, propelling or moving power within us, there residing and operating since being begotten by Jehovah as spiritual children or sons. It is not natural with us, that is, it is not inherited from Adam, but Jehovah put such spirit in his begotten sons, and it makes use of all our natural power, faculties and endowments in doing the will of God our heavenly Father, and causes us to perform unselfishly and in an unselfish manner show our devotion to God. It is “our spirit”, the spirit possessed by and given to all members of the body of Christ. Each one who is a member of His body should and must possess it.

<p><span class="font5">The Devil is attempting to destroy the “seed” of God’s “woman”, to whom Christ has delivered his testimony, that is, to God’s remnant, and everyone truly of the temple will be on the alert to aid his brethren, and to defeat the Devil in his wicked purpose. God’s anointed are in a class all to themselves; and by erring in the way appointed for them such erring one is in danger of death from which there is no resurrection. All the faithful, therefore, must see to it that nothing detrimental is done, to another of the temple company, but, on the contrary, everything must be done to safeguard and help such. They are all one in Christ Jesus, and the love of Christ binds together all who are of his spirit. Love must be the motive for all action of one toward another.

<p><span class="font5">The temple at Jerusalem was typical of Jehovah’s “anointed” company of people taken out for his name, of which company Christ Jesus is the Head. At the antitypical fulfillment of Solomon’s dedication of the temple it was appropriate that attention of God’s anointed people be called to the outpouring or anointing of God’s holy spirit upon all the approved ones. “Seven years” after A.D. 1918, at the convention at Indianapolis in 1925 there was then and there called to the attention of those assembled the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2:28, 29, concerning the outpouring of the holy spirit upon “all flesh”. In due time </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> November 15, 1925, published the article previously verbally spoken, to wit, “The Holy Spirit Poured Out.” No man prearranged this; the Lord undoubtedly directed it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession.—2 Chron. 20:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have never attempted to use politics or any like means or the legislative bodies or the courts to deprive any person of the freedom of thought or the operation of his organization or to prevent the expression of his views and convictions. They follow strictly the rule that there should exist and be freely practiced freedom of speech and of belief and expression. But it is the Devil’s organization which attempts to take away from others freedom of thought, speech, and action, in worship, and they use cruel means against Jehovah’s witnesses to prevent them from telling the truth, which God has commanded shall be told. They attempt to bring about the destruction of these faithful men and women who do proclaim God’s truth in obedience to his command. Thus they reward good with their evil acts. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But as touching brotherly love ... ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.—1 Thess. 4:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah loved both Jonathan and David because both were striving in the right way. Christ Jesus, the Greater David, loves the Jonathan class because they are his “other sheep” and his Father’s will is that he shall gather them into the fold. The anointed remnant, being “the feet of him”, must love the Jonathan class. They do love them and prove it by diligence in carrying to them the message of truth and aiding them to understand God’s purpose. This is pictured by the man clothed with linen with an inkhorn by his side, who marks seekers of righteousness in the forehead. (Ezek. 9:1-11) True love between the remnant and the Jonathan class, therefore, shows they must stand firmly together, being companions in service and unselfishly devoted to God and to the kingdom interest, and hence to each other’s interests. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This shows that God’s mercy never fails toward those who obey him. He is the God of mercy. Mercy not only to those who are of the temple, but toward the thousands of “other sheep”, the great multitude, is needed and received from the Lord. In 1928 the Lord began to make known to his people that he would take some of them through the battle of Armageddon, and then they began to have a better understanding; and so they began to sing of Jehovah’s mercy and his loving-kindness, which will preserve his people who are build-ed up into Zion, and that he will use these to have a part in the vindication of his name before and at the battle of Armageddon and beyond it. The revelation of this truth was a mercy to them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the resurrection humans are brought forth from the grave by God’s power. Those thus brought forth come not forth again from human parents, but by the resurrection. Hence they are “children of the resurrection”, that is, they receive their life from God even as the angels receive their life. Furthermore, angels are not tied together in the relationship of wedlock. The resurrected ones, that is, “children of the resurrection,” have no such ties, because death has dissolved whatever marriage relationship existed with reference to them. There is no need, at their resurrection, to again take on such marital relationship. They will have nothing to do with the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/38</span></p>

The great King, Christ Jesus, will rule, and he, upon whose shoulder the government rests, is indeed the Prince of Peace, and the time of his peace and prosperity will never end. The faithful remnant, entering fully into the glory of the King, will participate with him in the numberless blessings that will be ministered to others, to the glory of Jehovah God. The survivors of Armageddon will go unto the temple organization of Jehovah and forever praise his name. Then war having ended, strife done, no more shall Jehovah’s name be reproached. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/38</span></p>

That being true, no offspring then of the great multitude will die until it has had an individual, complete opportunity to know and obey the Lord and to prove integrity and devotion to God and thus prove worthy of life. When such person has received a full and complete opportunity and then willfully sins, that person will die accursed because proving himself unworthy of life. One might live according to the terms of the text for 500 years or even a thousand years, and then prove disobedient and therefore unworthy of life. One dying as an accursed sinner will not be mourned by anyone on earth, because God has commanded they shall not be sorrowful or weep. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Such is God’s means of sanctification. There is no other way of sanctification. Therefore the teaching of doctrines of men accomplishes anything but sanctification. It is not possible for man to walk in the way of righteousness without having a righteous guide. A perfect guide is necessary, because man is imperfect. Man cannot be properly guided by anything false. To be properly guided he must choose the way of truth and then follow in that way. The true guide for man is the Word of God. When one walks in the way God has marked out for obedient man, he is walking in the way of salvation. What is the truth ? Certainly not the opinions of man, when man is so imperfect and unable to save himself. God’s law is always true. Consequently the man who seeks the way to salvation must be governed by God’s law.

And receiving such words of encouragement and assurance from the Lord he went forth in the strength of Jehovah. His diffidence exactly corresponds with the timidity of frail men and women who now go forward in the witness work, knowing that they must face a cruel and powerful entrenched crowd of religionists who resort to unfair and underhanded methods of warfare. Jehovah today provides for the defense of his people.

When Satan was cast down to the earth he began to bring woe after woe upon the peoples, and he continues to do so. The people have since felt the great trouble and woe and are greatly agitated, even as the sea was agitated by the storm. In the spring of 1918 the Lord Jesus appeared at the temple of God clothed with all power in heaven and in earth, but he did not use that power to halt the World War merely to stop the nations from fighting among themselves, but that an opportunity might be had for Jehovah’s witnesses to proclaim his name in the earth.

Such ones, and such only, are called ‘in one hope of our calling’ (Eph. 4:4), and that hope is the heavenly, spiritual kingdom. Such must suffer the reproaches that fell upon Jesus, must be put to the crucial test to which he was subjected, and must endure much tribulation, and die with Christ Jesus. “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” Such suffering is essential for the members of the body to endure, and it is joyfully participated in by those who understand their privilege. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Can God put his spirit upon an earthly class of persons without begetting them by his spirit? He did that very thing in times of old, and, of course, he could do it again. Bezaleel was not begotten of God’s spirit nor anointed in the way members of Christ’s body are begotten and anointed, yet God filled him with His spirit. Of course, God’s dealing with Bezaleel was typical of how God anoints his great Craftsman, Christ Jesus, who builds his church, the temple of God, and teaches those of the temple. If God did such a work with a consecrated man before the time of Jesus, he will likewise put his spirit upon the earthly consecrated ones today who seek and serve Jehovah, and may do so without begetting them of his spirit. Such he does to the persons of good will. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/38</span></p>

This is another proof that “salvation is of the Lord” (vs. 9), and it is according to the will of God. Worse than foolish, then, is it for man to attribute salvation to another. Says the psalmist : “Thou art my King, 0 God: command deliverances for Jacob/<sup>5</sup> of whom Jonah was a descendant, picturing the anointed ones of God. (Ps. 44:4) Jonah was delivered by Jehovah from the belly of the fish, and that foreshadows the delivery of God’s people from bondage, which occurred in the . spring of 1919; and immediately thereafter his witnesses went to work to organize and carry on his service. To now see Jehovah’s loving-kindness foretold in prophecy, as that of Jonah, brings real gladness to the heart of everyone who loves and serves the Lord.

Those of the little flock have the spirit of subjection to the Father of spirits at the time of being chastened as sons. Such Jehovah begat by his own will with the Word of Truth, and therefore such begotten ones have the spirit of truth. (Heb. 12:9; Jas. 1:18) When their eyes of discernment are open, such are free from religion and have the testimony of the spirit of such freedom. (Gal. 4: 9,10) Such appreciate their privilege of dying a sacrificial death with Christ, because they know and realize it is the condition precedent to entering into his life and glory. “For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him.”—2 Tim. 11:12.

The few faithful men of old by faith saw the coming righteous rule of Christ Jesus, the King, and set their hearts upon that kingdom, remained faithful and true to God, and therefore receive a good report, and God has prepared for them a place in his organization.

The faithful apostles and other spirit-begotten ones who continue faithful love righteousness and hate lawlessness, and these determinedly remain true and faithful to God, refusing to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization.

It also sets forth the proper precedent by which the earthly father and mother of children who are devoted to God are to be guided.

If anyone desires to take a chance by seeking self-exaltation and the praise of men or by dominating the company and thus satisfying his own selfish desires or ambitions, let him take warning that he is certain to be east away into everlasting darkness. No one will attempt to prevent his taking a wrongful course, and therefore the troublemaker is responsible for his own destiny. Those who desire the Lord’s approval will take heed to his warning and will avoid all strife and trouble and will work together in complete harmony with others of his elect people. All of the temple company, being at unity, do love every member of the temple organization and always seek the good of such, and they avoid doing anything that might work injury to any member of the body of Christ.

<p><span class="font5">Blessed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. —Matt. 5: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who learn of God and walk obediently with him will delight to have an opportunity to carry the kingdom message to the people of good will and thus inform them of Jehovah’s mercy toward the people of good will. As there were “sixseore thousand persons” in Nineveh entirely ignorant so today there are millions in “Christendom” entirely ignorant by reason of the blinding influence exercised over them by the Devil and his religious practitioners. It is God’s will that such ignorant .ones may have an opportunity to know and to take the right course before his execution of final judgment, and by sending them the truth he shows his mercy and loving-kindness toward them. The true remnant of God, his witnesses on earth, love the Lord’s “other sheep”, called Jonadabs, and regard and treat them as companions.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And Jonathan loved him as his own soul.-l Sam. 18:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonathan’s being much older than David agrees with the fact now known to God’s people, that the earthly company of God’s servants began before the coming of Christ Jesus. Although the faithful men of old were witnesses for Jehovah before the coming of Christ Jesus, they are secondary in point of being perfected, their perfection waiting until after the spiritual class is selected and made perfect. (Heb. 11:39,40) Jonathan, continuing to show his faith in God and also his devotion to David, shows that he pictured another earthly class that stands on the side of God and shows great faith in God and his King, Christ Jesus, and that this latter class appear after the second coming of the Lord Jesus and his appearing at the temple. In this, therefore, Jonathan pictured those “other sheep’’, or the great multitude, that are gathered to Jehovah under Christ.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s great Apostle, has laid hands upon “The Society” as his “faithful and wise servant” and visible representative. It has been and is a “partaker of the afflictions of the gospel” and is not ashamed of bonds and imprisonment for his sake, rejoicing to have part in the reproaches that have fallen upon God and Christ Jesus. (1:8) “The Society,” acting as the Lord’s servant and representative, commits the testimony work to his faithful witnesses now on earth. (2:2) They too must study to properly perform and set forth God’s will for his people. (2:15) The policy of “The Society” is true to the instructions given to Timothy: “Shun profane and vain babblings”; “foolish and unlearned questions avoid.” Its mission is to “preach the word”.—2 Tim. 2:16, 23; 4: 2.

<p><span class="font5">There is neither reason nor excuse now for any of the temple company to be at enmity with any of their brethren at the temple. No reason, because no one is justified in attempting to work injury to his brother in Christ; and no excuse, on the ground of ignorance or otherwise, because the Lord has now made clearly to appear to all such the meaning of his Word, that all of the temple are “one in Christ Jesus”, and that it is love that holds them together, that is, an unselfish determination to do good to one another and to all men, especially to the household of God. In order now to stand together and to withstand the assault of the enemy, all of God’s people must be firmly bound to one another in love for Christ and his kingdom. Let no one falter now in his devotion to the kingdom and his fellow temple workers. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With Armageddon staring the faithful right in the face, they know they do not need carnal weapons of war, because they are not to employ any such. It is a great consolation to them to have the full assurance from Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, that this is His battle. Jehovah’s witnesses are not now directed by him to hole up in some supposed place of security in the backwoods. Those who serve him are not to move softly or crawl about in an apologetic way to represent the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses must now march out to face the enemy, take their position in the open and in plain view, where they can be seen, and openly, boldly and emphatically make known the message of Jehovah by proclaiming his kingdom.

Look for and expect a concerted movement on the part of the commercial, political, religious, and other radical elements of the Devil’s organization to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. When that danger becomes imminent, let all the faithful keep in mind the words spoken from Jehovah: “The battle is not yours, hut God’s.” Remember that he preserved his faithful people in times of old who stood for his name and his cause. Be assured that the strength of Almighty God will he manifested in behalf of those who obey him. (2 Chron. 16:9) All protection and salvation and deliverance of God’s people must come through him.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Righteousness</span><span class="font5"> means doing gladly according to God’s will by measuring up to and carrying out the commission God has given to his anointed people. That does not mean the driving of the unwilling, hut that the love of righteousness is the driving or impelling force, that is, the moving cause. It is the love of God and the vindication of his name that impels such to proceed to push on with the work of fulfilling the commission God has given them. Therefore all must he fully united in action and harmoniously 'serving him day and night in his temple’, willingly and with unspeakable joy. The right motive, therefore, drives or moves God’s people into harmonious action. It is such works of righteousness and such workers that obtain the approval of the Lord.

There is an alliance on the part of the religionists who pretend to be for God with all those who openly oppose God and his kingdom, the purpose of which conspiracy is to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. After the destruction of the religious elements at Armageddon the others of Satan’s organization will continue to violently oppose all on the side of Jehovah and his King. Such enemies constitute Satan’s forces, lined up in full opposition to Jehovah’s organization. Jehovah’s witnesses must therefore keep in mind that opposition to them will continue until Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, smites the opponents at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand.—1 Sam. 23:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus Jonathan displayed his faith in Jehovah God and in God’s purpose concerning his anointed one. Jonathan, although afforded many opportunities to do so, never betrayed David. Others did betray </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> to Saul, telling Saul of David’s whereabouts; in this such persons pictured the “evil servant” class that willingly co-operate with the other religionists or Saul class to work injury to Jehovah’s witnesses. But the “other sheep”, pictured by Jonathan, visit the remnant and comfort them when in prison and when they are otherwise persecuted. The “other sheep”, like Jonathan, are confident of the ultimate success of the cause of Jehovah’s anointed ones, and confess their own secondary position in the Lord’s arrangement and are willing to hold to their covenant arrangement, by faithful service with God’s anointed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At that time all living human creatures joined in the united worship of Jehovah. That was pleasing to the Most High. The human creatures that stood there were under condemnation by inheritance, and over which they had no control. Those survivors of the flood, however, were counted righteous by Jehovah by reason of faith in and obedience to God. The flood and the attending results were typical, foretelling God’s purpose to bring his wrath upon the earth by Christ Jesus and thus execute the wicked. True, the Jonadabs today are not counted members of God’s royal organization, but their protection and safety is from Jehovah God by and through his organization of which Christ Jesus is the Head. Comfort and rest will come when Armageddon has ended. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Let the Jonadabs now take heed, be diligent in seeking righteousness and meekness, be faithful and energetic in doing God’s will and thus show their appreciation of Jehovah’s loving-kindness, that they may be found worthy to have a part in carrying out the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. That mandate performed within the thousand years, and paradise extended throughout the earth, then “the rest of the dead” shall be awakened and the obedient ones who prove their integrity by standing the test will be counted worthy to obtain the world without end and live for ever. God’s purpose having been accomplished, there will be no need for further propagation of the race. The complete vindication of Jehovah’s name will call forth the praise of every living creature, and all the universe will be filled with righteousness to the praise of Almighty God.

The Jonathan class, or “other sheep”, see and appreciate God’s “strange work”, in which Jehovah’s witnesses are permitted to participate, and they know that such is evidence that God’s favor is upon the remnant or David class. Therefore they render assistance to Jehovah’s witnesses, even as Jonathan rendered assistance unto David. Jonathan never approved of Saul’s hatred to David.

One title he now bears is “The Faithful and True Witness”. With Jesus Jehovah begins the creation of the new heavens and proceeds to the building of his capital organization. To Christ Jesus, the Head thereof, he commits all power and supervision over his universal organization. The exalted Jesus is made the Head of that capital organization and is clothed with all power in heaven and earth. God gave him twelve disciples, eleven of whom maintained their integrity unto death and are made a part of the new heavens. They, like Christ Jesus, were true witnesses to Jehovah’s name, and it was necessary for them to prove their faithfulness and to maintain their integrity under severe test. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W11/15/38 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . . and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God.—Phil. 2:10,11.</span></p>

All of such shall confess the name of and joyfully submit to Christ Jesus the King, whom Jehovah has made the Ruler over the earth.

The Lord has committed to them through Christ Jesus the kingdom interests, which interests include faithful obedience in carrying out his instructions to declare the kingdom message. Having committed to his witnesses much, the Lord demands of them much more than a mere passive obedience. They must prove themselves entirely reliable and dependable. Dependability shown in small things shows dependability in greater things. The privilege of now serving Jehovah in his “strange work” is the greatest privilege ever given to man. Such witnesses then must show faithfulness and dependability in all things that the Lord commits into their hands.

Being prisoners who have been held in restraint by religionists, the people of good will had not directed their prayers to Jehovah, not knowing of the privileges they might have. They have looked to the Lord’s faithful servant class for information that they might find and go in the right way. It is therefore the privilege and duty of Jehovah’s witnesses to render all possible aid to those persons and to enable them to see the way of the Lord, and in doing this they must carry the kingdom message to such and assist them to understand its meaning and encourage them to engage in service of God and his kingdom.

The people of Nineveh that repented represented particularly the Lord’s “other sheep”, who form the great multitude, which come forth from many nations and serve God. Their believing and coming is a blighting condemnation to “Christendom”, even as the Israelites were condemned by the faith of some of the Ninevites. The people of Nineveh, from the greatest to the least, proclaimed a fast. God did not recognize rank or class distinction among them, nor does he among any people.

Christ Jesus, the exalted King of Jehovah, is at his temple and has gathered to himself those who have successfully passed the test of judgment, and these Jehovah has anointed. All such are now glad and rejoicing in the Lord. Christ Jesus is the great Vindicator of Jehovah, and his chief joy is the vindication of his Father’s name, for which purpose he has come. To his faithful followers, whom he has gathered into the temple, he gives invitation to share his joy.

To such the spirit bears witness that they are the sons of God, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. At the coming of the Lord to the temple and the gathering to himself at the temple of those who have responded to the invitation for the kingdom, and who upon examination have been found approved and been brought into the temple, such occupy an intimate relationship to him. No longer is it necessary for the advocate, the holy spirit, to testify to them, but the Lord Jesus himself is their strength and guide, because he is with them.

Note Jesus’ words above about those who remain under the robe of righteousness and fight for the King. Those words furnish a warning now to all who claim to be his servants. If any seek the honor and praise of men, they are certain to fall.

In the type the miscarriage of the plan to slay the Judeans was due to the direct “act of God”.

This relation they will enjoy at some time, when all are brought into one fold. The great multitude was predestinated as a company, and not as a definite number. They are not called and sealed as members of God’s royal house of sons, but they do receive ‘the mark in their foreheads’, being given understanding of his purpose toward them.

Also they may have a share in the delivery of Jehovah’s message from door to door, thus sharing in the service of the King.

By “nurture” is meant training and discipline in order to develop the child and bring it up as God has commanded. By “admonition” is meant counsel, advice, teaching and instruction, and thus to make the child acquainted with the will or commandment and law and purpose of Jehovah.

They will feel great indignation and sorrow by reason of what the enemy has done to God’s anointed. Concerning such faithful ones, “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.” The faithful remnant, who thus die, will have an instantaneous resurrection. Also the resurrection of the faithful Jonadabs, who may thus fall, is certain. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning.—Isa. 1:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus fulfills this prophecy of restoring the judges at his coming to the temple. He is the great Judge before whom are now gathered for judgment all the nations of the earth, and his judgment begins “at the house of God”. Following the judgment of his covenant people, the approved ones he has brought into the temple and thus builded up Zion. Zion becomes “the city of righteousness, the faithful city”. Those who come to Zion to find protection and safety, that is, the great multitude, must also become righteous, and then follows the destruction of the wicked crowd. “The city of righteousness” must of necessity be a city of peace with all the overseers thereof acting in righteousness, in harmony with the will of God as he foretold. The organization or government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus is strictly theocratic. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fight for your brethren.—Neh. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All those assembled on the Lord’s side and devoted to him see the oncoming wicked host. Knowing that within themselves they are helpless against such a horde, these faithful servants cry unto Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Surely every one of the temple company will now realize this time of peril, their position of great danger, and therefore appreciate that this is the time for every one of them to stand firmly in the Lord, completely united in his cause of righteousness. All faces of such are toward Jehovah and his King, and all stand shoulder to shoulder with a determination to serve God and knowing that their dependence is solely upon Jehovah and his King. Surely all such now of the temple must see that anyone of that company who seeks the hurt or injury of another in the company of the temple would immediately call down upon his own head the wrath of the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.—Eph. 1:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The office David filled, and therefore David, the one who filled it, was determined upon before he was conceived and born, and his selection as king was in fulfillment of Genesis 49:10. So also was Christ Jesus the king foretold long before his human birth and his later baptism and spiritual birth. Both David and the child Jesus were born at Bethlehem, even as God had caused to be prophesied. The collective membership of Christ’s body, the church, was also foreknown and foreordained of God. All of such, that is, Jesus and the members of his body, are spiritual Judeans, prais-ers of Jehovah. Christ Jesus comes out of Bethlehem the greater 'house of bread”, through which God gives life to all believers. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The battle is not yours, but God's. To morrow go ye down against them.—2 Chron. 20:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now a great relief and full assurance to the people of Jehovah God to hear the words from the throne of the Most High spoken by his servant Christ Jesus. There was to be no delay on the part of the people of God then, and certainly no delay now, but the gun must be well loaded before the shooting began, speaking figuratively. Likewise God’s people must now be ready. As a short time would bring the enemy closer, even so today a little time is given to allow the enemy to approach closer. While they are so doing, the time and opportunity are afforded for God’s people to study his Word and to deliberate upon how to carry out his will, and to organize themselves in an orderly and efficient manner for service, and to thereby express faith in. God and Christ Jesus, and to thus show their fearlessness of the enemy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, . . . The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.—2 Pet. 2:4,5,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The antitypical Noah, Christ Jesus, at God’s command, builds his capital organization, of which the faithful remnant form a part. The faithful “great multitude”, pictured by Noah’s family, find refuge, protection and safety under the organization of the Lord. Those survivors of Armageddon, counted righteous by reason of their faith and obedience to God and Christ, are regenerated by Christ and receive life from him, “the Everlasting Father.” Under his supervision and command the great multitude receives the divine mandate. In obedience thereto the great multitude marry and, like Noah’s sons after the flood, bring forth children. The great multitude therefore carry out God’s mandate to “multiply and fill the earth” with righteous persons. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.—Gen. 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The King and his kingdom are here. All the consecrated have all their interests centered in that kingdom. It is their desire to now learn everything they can about the kingdom and its requirements. They are keenly interested in knowing exactly what is right, that they may walk in the way of righteousness to the Lord’s glory. Now they see it will be the privilege of the great multitude to carry out God’s mandate to multiply and fill the earth. While carrying out this mandate not only may their children have house cats for pets, but they will fondle and play with the cubs of the tiger, the bear and the lion, and the little child will lead about the beast, whose kind once fled in fear of man. That will be a happy time to the glory of the great Creator.—Psalm 150. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/38</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and [fill] the earth.—Gen. 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God announced that purpose and gave command Adam and Eve were righteous, because sin had not then entered the world. Manifestly God’s purpose was and is that such mandate shall be fully performed and carried out under a righteous invisible overlord and therefore performed in righteousness. Furthermore, the mandate to “be fruitful and multiply” was and is to be unto life of the creature brought into the earth. To demonstrate the divine rule or command would require the same to be carried out by righteous creatures on earth acting under the supervision of a righteous overlord. Satan, the wicked overlord, and his entire organization must first be destroyed and then the control of the earth be entirely removed from all opponents of Jehovah, and it be under the control of the righteous One, that human creatures might carry out the divine mandate.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.—1 Sam. 18:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That covenant would not mean those two men would love each other for some selfish purpose, but their love was because both were following a righteous course, and their covenant would compel them to deal justly one with the other and avoid envy and criticism and family feuds. Likewise the Jonathan class must make a covenant with Christ Jesus, the Greater David. They must recognize Christ Jesus as one of the “higher powers” and Jehovah’s anointed King, and that Jehovah is the Supreme Power and hence Jehovah and Christ Jesus alone constitute the “higher powers”. The solemn agreement or covenant binds the Jonathan class to Jehovah’s organization, over which Christ Jesus is Head, and of which the remnant on earth are a part. The covenant shows the binding relationship of companions between the two. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">At the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord, and his own house, ... he built . . . throughout all the land.—2 Chron. 8:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the “twenty years” Solomon employed nonIsraelite or foreign laborers. That seems to clearly correspond with the Jonadabs or non-anointed ones participating in the Lord’s service. The end of the “twentieth year” came in the fulfillment on April 2, 1938. After the twenty years of Solomon’s building program he engaged in a nation-wide building program. Then came the queen of Sheba “from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon”. This suggests the question: What is in the immediate future for the people of Jehovah on earth? With full confidence we will wait, and we shall see. The Lord is guiding his people. His theocratic government is in operation and complete control. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For behold me! creating Jerusalem an exultation, and her people a joy.—Isa. 65:18, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jerusalem, that is, Jehovah’s organization, which will include the righteous people of earth after Armageddon, must therefore be without sorrow. The new heavens is already an exultation and a joy to all who love and serve God. The new earth will be a. part of Jerusalem because a part of God’s organization and under the one great Shepherd, King and Ruler. It is controlled by the kingdom, and hence a part of God’s organization. The new heavens and new earth will then rejoice and her people will be a joy for ever. They will be a joy to Jehovah because in complete vindication of his name. From the time of the beginning of operation of the “new earth” under the supervision, direction and rule of the new heavens ‘there shall be heard no more any sound of weeping or sound of a cry’. God will wipe away all tears by establishing his righteous rule in the earth, and his people will have no occasion to be sorrowful.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their strength in the time of trouble.—Ps. 37:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now God has builded up Zion, and those of Zion who have proved themselves faithful have maintained their integrity toward God and proved his supremacy, and that proves Satan is a liar. Now the Lord gathers to himself his “other sheep” that will comprise the “great multitude”. All such as prove faithful and maintain their integrity will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. That does not mean that all who are Jonadabs will prove faithful, but all who are ultimately of the great multitude must be faithful and shall maintain integrity toward God. To that faithful multitude God will commit the great privilege of fulfilling .his mandate to “multiply and fill the earth”, and those who compose then the righteous people of the earth will receive the benefit of salvation and also be a vindication of His name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/38</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THERE are many clergymen in the Church of England who are sympathetic toward Rome’s forward movement in England. Such clergymen adroitly put their feelings into words, generally protesting that they are not pro-Roman, though their obvious ignorance, whether willing or otherwise, of the first principles of Christianity indicates that they are partly if not entirely bejesuited (to use an expression employed by Milton).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of these clergymen, rejoicing over the fact that Rome would again have an envoy in England, for the first time in 400 years, indicates that he looks to Rome for salvation from the threatening dangers to what he is pleased to call “Christianity”. The lessons of history, not to speak of the admonitions of Scripture, seem to have been wholly lost on Vicar George Braithwaite of St. Stephen’s, Oldham. Otherwise, why this looking to Rome and prating at the same time about the “Ideal held up by Christ”? What is the connection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-The largeness of heart with which so-called “Protestants” favor Rome does not seem to be reciprocated. It must have been a huge satisfaction to the pope to have the British agree with Mussolini that only Italian Roman Catholic missionaries may henceforth be sent to Ethiopia. Protestant missionaries are excluded. (Chamberlain is well-named, and the pope should make him one of his own chamberlains in recognition of his services.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In countries where the Roman system is represented by a minority, its agents are pleased to co-operate with other “faiths” in a show of liberality and tolerance, although even then they try to steal the show; but in countries where Rome rules, Protestants are the victims of invidious discriminations, if they arc not excluded altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a meeting of “faiths” at Royal Albert Hall, December 1, protest was made against persecutions in Germany. Cardinal Hinsley,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 8, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">all decked out in his scarlet robes, was the main attraction. The archbishop of York, representative of the so-called “Church of England”, wasn’t in it, although he represented a much larger “faith” group than the scarlet-robed one. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font5"> should have worn yellow robes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bishop of Croydon, W. L. Anderson, makes an admission of ignorance and shows he knows precious little about the Bible, which is all to the good, as far as Rome is concerned. He remarked, speaking to the unemployed, on October 24, “Nobody is more conscious than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">that our conceptions of God are in places out of date ... I do find it rather dull to think of twanging harps all day long.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">There is an occasional lucid moment in the lives of clergymen. The archbishop of Canterbury, in a statement published in the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express,</span><span class="font5"> remarked, “It sometimes looks as if the world were, for the present, under the domination of evil spirits.” That is exactly the case, as a matter of fact. If clergymen would keep that fact in mind, so plainly stated in Scripture, they would not be so eager to align themselves with the world and with the “friend of the world” at Rome., In the county of London, out of 7,500,000<sup>s </sup>people, fewer than 400,000 regularly attend any church; which shows that the inhabitants of the world’s biggest city have had about all the religion they care for. It would &amp;em as if in such a populace there would be a goodly number that will take their stand for real Christianity when they know what it is, and that it is the exact opposite of religion, for which it is apparent they have no use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a goodly number of Englishmen that are dimly -aware of the J esuit i zing that is being carried on in darkness,.and which has a finger in every pie, influencing government, cinema, radio, press and religious groups.* * See “Secret Instructions of the Jesuits”, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conso-tion</span><span class="font5"> No. 479. Also page 26 in this issue. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An organization named “The Council for Investigation of Vatican Influence and Censorship” has been formed in London.. The C. I. V. I.C. purposes to investigate the subversive activities of the Korn an Catholic Hierarchy and to publish the facts. It has a big job on its hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like Viear George Braithwaite, Roger Babson, famous statistician, realizes and has widely circulated the statement that humanity must make its choice between Christ and Collapse. That is true, and “Christendom”, of .which England is a prominent part, has already made the choice: Christ has been rejected; His reign is not desired, and His followers and witnesses arc not desired. The result of this choice, the Collapse of “Christendom”, will come In Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the reasons for this collapse is the fact that its religious leaders are among the International Murderers. Among the racketeers holding shares in the British armament companies are 32 clergymen, including bishops and archdeacons. An official of the Y.M.C.A. holds more than 20,000 shares in a company building battleships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Waiting for Guidance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Dr. F. N. D. Buchman, leader of the Oxford Group, in a speech broadcast in England and the United States, said, “The world is waiting for guidance.” Let us see. How long is it since Jesus sajd, “I am the way, the truth and the life” ? For what is tlm world waiting? For what is Dr. Buchman waiting? The world, particularly the professed Christian world, and still more especially the English-speaking world, has had the Scriptures for many centuries. The circulation of the Bible in the last century has been phenomenal if not miraculous. It shows what sincere effort in a given right direction can accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tn the year 1802 “Reverend”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font5">Thomas Charles asked the Tract </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I j </span><span class="font5">Society to publish a cheap edition feMj^siof the Welsh Bible, and added, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nnnraim </span><span class="font5">«<sub>anc</sub>j f<sub>or</sub> \y<sub>a</sub>i<sub>eSi w</sub>by <sub>no</sub>f f<sub>or</sub> th<sub>c </sub>whole world?” with the result that portions of Holy Writ are now to be had in over a thousand languages. The thousandth tongue was the African tongue of Hakata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of Brooklyn, New York, and the International Bible Students Association, of London, England, have circulated millions of hooks containing sincere, common-sense, spiritual and helpful studies in the Bible. These same organizations have broadcast by radio and every other ' means at their command the gospel of Christ’s kingdom and a reasonable answer to the question, “What doth the Lord require of thee?” The world, “Christendom,” England, does'not want for guidance. What is wanting is the willingness to accept the guidance available. Jehovah’s witnesses call attention to this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Little by little Roman practices are being introduced into the Church of England, professedly Protestant. The vicar of Littlehampton indulges in the “blessing” of automobiles, but not in the way pedestrians generally “bless” them. He walks along a row of these deadly instruments, reciting prayers and sprinkling them with “holy” water. It is all done in ’ regular style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Leaders” and others in the Church of England, however, do not seem to mind. J. W., Hope, of Suffolk, England, remarks the trend Homeward as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before corning to a knowledge of the y truth I was an altar-server in the parish church of Lowestoft of the Church of England. It was very noticeable that INK each time a new priest came he introduced a bit more ritual, and now I see that two of the curates walk the streets with their cassocks [black nightshirts] on, a thing they formerly never dreamed of doing. When they had to take them with them, they rolled them up around their waists, under their coats, so as not to be seen. In the Sunday schools we were taught that the Reformation came about because England had become filled with Italian priests who neglected their work., The ritual was explained to us as the true worship that was instituted in the early church, and that the robes worn by the priests were of the same style as those worn by the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where the “peaceful penetration” illustrated in the foregoing paragraph seems inadequate or unnecessary, other methods are employed, for instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At 2:30 in a morning of last year, 24 masked and armed men came to Portland Park House, Portumna, Ireland, awakened the inmates, and told them they had come to burn the house, with its contents. The house was to have been used as a home for Protestant 'orphans. One of these men told the woman of the house, Mrs. Densmore, that they did not like burning the house,' but that they had their orders. The 25-room house, with its contents of furniture and other comforts intended for those bereft of parents, was burned to the ground, and the 24 servants of the Devil went back to the son of the Devil who sent them, to tell him that they had done as they were bid. When the religious gangster that instigated this crime perishes at Armageddon, every decent person that knows the facts will offer praise to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately after the liberty of the Protestant country of Czechoslovakia was taken away, there was a demand from Dublin that the British Government hand over Northern Ireland to the 'tender mercies’ of the crowd ruled by Pome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a measure of truth in the claim made by Earnon de Valera, prime minister of Ireland, that Britain is foreign to Ireland, but he is wrong in holding that Britain should for that reason cease “interfering” in the affairs of Ireland by keeping the North and the South apart. The Protestant Irish have no desire to be anything but apart from the Rome-controlled part of the Emerald Isle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Elsewhere in the Commonwealth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span><span class="font5"> Canada has virtually surrendered to Rome. Though Quebec’s Padlock Law is known to be unconst it ution-I* al, not a single vote against it was * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ &quot;&quot;&nbsp;cast in a legislature of 115 members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law could have been denounced by the Minister of Justice, Ernest Lapointe, but he failed to do so; and you can guess why. The new leader of the Conservative party, Dr. Manion, is a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">M, Leo Sweeney, manufacturer, Vancouver, British Columbia, advises the Canadian Government to go Nazi. Seems as if the advice were hardly needed. A five-column picture in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram</span><span class="font5"> shows Adrien Arcand, and other members of his and Mr. Sweeney’s own beliefs, religious and political, drilling with the men that he declares he will use in a march on Ottawa to install just such a government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Hierarchy is about ready to seize Canada and that country may go Fascist at almost any time. In the city of Quebec the “Reverend Father” Pierre Gravel openly proposed a revolution, hailing dictators as the saviors of the world. The plan for seizing Ottawa involves the departure from Montreal at 6 p.m. sharp in cars and trucks of the forces that are to co-operate with traitors in Ottawa for the seizure of Parliament, telegraph, and radio stations, and the declaration that Fascism has gained control. A French paper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L’Autorite, </span><span class="font5">anti-Fascist, in some way came into possession of the plans of Adrien Areand and his fellow Fascists and gave them wide publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesuitized Australia /</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sydney Town Hall, refused to Judge. Rutherford for the purpose of declaring the warning that “Christendom” is about to perish because of its refusal to take its stand on God’s side, was granted to the Nazi raider Von Luckner for three days in the month of June. During the World War Von Luckner sent to the bottom thousands of tons of British vessels. There is no question Judge Rutherford is antiNazi and that the forces which closed this Australian auditorium to him are pro-Nazi and anti-British.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Nazi protagonist, otherwise known as the lord mayor of Sydney, Australia, has been asked to resign because of his insufferable treatment of Christians. Mr. Alex. MacGillivray, who made the request, suggests the following plaque be put upon the Svdney Town Hall: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This hall is not for the use of the citizens of Sydney who are Christians, but is reserved only for those of Catholic Action and Fascist tendencies, and particularly for representatives of Germany who may visit this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This suggestion was published in the Sydney </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font5"> and the Sydney </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Reverend Father” Kelly, Roman Catholic archbishop of Syd<sup>ne</sup>Y&gt; Australia, states that eondi-tions are now worse than they were many years ago, when he read that-Australia is a country where the trees shed their' bark instead of their leaves, flowers have no perfume, birds have no song, and women have no virtue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Australian newspapers gladly tout an apostle of such slanders against reason and common sense, so as to uphold the Roman racket, but reserve all their meanness to attack the truth of God’s Word when it comes to them by a real Christian gentleman, Judge Rutherford. What a disgrace!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">January 6, 1939, Australia’s prime minister, Joseph Aloysius Lyons, called down H. G. Wells, noted author, for making derogatory remarks about Hitler and Mussolini, calling them ‘personal insults’ to those worthy characters. '</span></p>

The reason for suggesting this is that the new governor will be Sir Arthur Frederick Richards, until June, 1938, the governor of Fiji. It was the outrageous conduct of the officials of Fiji, under this governor, that deprived the people of those islands from hearing a presentation of the message of God’s Kingdom by Judge Rutherford, on his recent trip to Australia. God’s true people in Jamaica, as in Fiji, Germany and other dark places, are probably in for a hard time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In his Munich speech on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the unsuccessful Munich Putsch, Hitler said, “Beyond the colonial question Germany has no demands to make on France and Great Britain.” He also said, “There are certainly men in power in France and Great Britain who want peace, but there are other men who do not conceal that they want war with Germany.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only is Chamberlain acceptable to Hitler; he is also approved by the pope. The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font5"> contains an article with a two-column heading entitled, “Cham-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">berlain is supported by the Vatican. His calm is our hope for peace.” This confirms the con\ elusion that Chamberlain, by yielding to demands of Mussolini, Hitler and Franco, is doing what the pope wants done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>r</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Britain, in its surrender to the Nazis, dragged France with her. Part of Miat France lost in the betrayal of Czechoslovakia is that the disheartened Czechs made no effort to prevent the Germans from learning all the secrets of their french-designed Maginot line, and now the Germans know as much about the Maginot line between France and Germany as the French know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Italian government is one of the many that are engaged in the highly laudable and honorable work of seeing that nobody intervenes in the war in Spain. One slight difficulty, however, is that the said government has thus far landed troops or munitions to help Franco on thirty-nine occasions; at Iqgst that is the claim made by the officials of the Spanish Republic. The situation is much like that of a watchman employed to take care of a property. He breaks in and helps himself thirty-nine times. Could you blame the house owner if, after a time, he becomes suspicious that the watchman is not all he should be? On August 23, 1938, Count Galeazzo Ciano, Italian Foreign minister, and son-in-law of Il Duce, formally admitted to the British charge d’affaires that Italy was sending fresh armies and war material to the Rebel armies. There was no way of lying out of the evidence presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now that the Ai gio-Italian accord has been ratified, Great Britain formally recognizes the Italian '’onquest of Ethiopia; but Italian troops have not been withdrawn from Spain as agreed when the accord was reached. What is that old saw about “honor among diplomats”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">British Foreign Secretary Halifax, in a speech before the House of Lords, said, “We understand that the British-Italian agreement does not hinder Premier Mussolini from doing everything in his power to win a victory for General Franco.” Why, of course not. Who thought it did?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the German battleship Deutschland left Gibraltar for Cadiz the British battlecruiser Hood did the handsome thing. Its band played “Deutschland fiber Alles” just after it was decided at Munich to deliver Czechoslovakia to Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British schoolboy who is reported to have said, “The prevailing religion in England is hypocrisy/’ was probably not far wrong. While willing to play “Deutschland fiber Alles”, England is going to do what it can to forestall such an eventuality. It may be willing to have &quot;Deutschland liber Alles” in Czechoslovakia and some other places, but to have it “fiber Alles” in Britain is something else again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">True, over 57 British ships have been attacked in Spanish waters and several British subjects killed, and the British Government announced that it would do nothing about it The ships were lawfully in pursuit of their legitimate trade. They had,on board only agreed merchandise. The attacks were deliberate, not accidental, and after several of the ships had been bombed the crews were machine-gunned. But Britain appears to be complaisant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Men’s Hearts Failing Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is no wonder men’s hearts are failing them for fear. Airplane factories in California are working day and night to increase Britain’s supply of war planes; British telephone operators are being trained to work with gas masks; steel concerns are advertising steel cellars which may be buried in gardens ; and a whole nation is trying to make a curtain to prevent bombers from getting in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Americans can hardly appreciate the pathetic attempts to live, as disclosed in the British papers published at the height of the Czechoslovakian crisis. Just before the Munich conference the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font5"> published instructions on how to make a refuge for six persons at a distance of 20 feet from the home. It would be 10 feet long, 4^ feet deep, 31 feet wide at the base, and 4j feet wide at the top. There would be cinders in the bottom; there would be a roof of corrugated iron, with a little slope to it; entrance would be by lifting a portion of the roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Britain reports a World War veteran who hung himself because of the furore created by possible gas attacks. At nearly every lecture on poison gas someone fainted. Women fainted in the streets of London during an air-raid test. A volunteer air warden died from the strain after leaving a gas chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font5"> contained a picture occupying a half page, labeled “Gasmasks and bombs at a wedding”. It shows a “church” with a huge cross and upon it a life-size figure being crucified. In the foreground are guests wearing gas masks, steel helmets apd decontamination suits. The bride and bridegroom passed out through an archway of incendiary bomb scoops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the 400 military planes bought in the United States the first week in June are delivered to Britain, it is just possible the tone of British diplomacy toward Italy and Germany may change somewhat; for those planes, it is confidently believed, will outfly and outfight anything else now flying in the skies, and in the hands of British flyers would be almost certain to do so. Britain has the money, it has the bien, and history indicates that when it has the necessary airships it would seem to be a good time for somebody to watch his steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that Britain intends to make her military air equipment second to none. It has already a tremendous advantage in commercial aviation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">First Place in Aviation</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390208_files/g_E_19390208-8.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">First place in aviation is claimed by Britain, which has 80,000 miles <sup>;</sup>n operation as against 63,600 miles' A the United States. Over 3,300,000 miles were flown in Britain in 1937, and 161,000 passengers and 1,300 tons of freight and mails were carried without one serious accident. An excellent record,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nipe days to Australia by air is considered only a start. The Imperial Airways now have biweekly service from London to Sydney, Australia, by seaplanes. The schedule, nine days at first, is to be changed to seven days after a little. Departures from England are on Thursday and Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Flight from Egypt to Australia has already been made in two days. Three British bombers flew nonstop from Ismailia, Egypt, to Darwin, Australia, a flight of 7,162 miles, in 48 hours and 5 minutes after their take-off. The final 800 miles of this distance record was made in a driving tropical rain. The total distance flown was 856 miles greater than the Russian flight from Moscow to San Jacinto, California, and done in 14 hours less time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three days to Sydney is the schedule envisaged for the not far distant future. The Royal Netherlands Indies Airways announce their intention of putting on a three-day schedule between London and Sydney, Australia, in 1941. Passengers will fly in sealed cabins above the weather, at a height of four to five miles above the earth. Forty passengers will be carried by day, and 26 by night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pickaback flying, too, may prove advantageous in ease of war. The British have proved that a big flying machine can carry a small flying machine on its back, rise into the air, gain momentum, and the smaller plane can, then be detached and can (and did) fly the Atlantic ocean, the mother plane remaining in the homeland. Military men see some possibilities in this invention, but it is not known if it is valuable otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It now' appears that by the end of 1939 ■ Britain will have 6,000 fast fighting planes and that this will be twice as many as Germany had in the big bluff of September, 1938. The so-called ‘’'statesmen” of the world spread abroad the alleged misinformation that Hitler had 10,000 planes at his command, when he had but 3,000; at least so it is cla imed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A single-seat fighting monoplane, called the &quot;British Super-Marine Spitfire 1”, is the world’s fastest military aircraft. The Air Ministry stated that this ship has a speed of 350 miles an hour. A thousand are being built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">London financiers have expressed the opinion that the threat of a trade-w<sup>r</sup>ar with Germany has tended to make the Nazis somewhat more reasonable and willing to talk things over with a view to a trade agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Durham Miners’ Association, Mby its executive committee, sent a resolution to the German ambassador, Prime Minister Chamber-lain, Lord Halifax, and others protesting against “the cruel iniquities” perpetrated by the Nazis, which, the resolution stated, “relegated the Nazi government and its supporters to the depths of barbarism.” The resolution protested against a proposed visit of Goering to England. The Miners’ Association has 120.000 members.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Hauens for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Refugees</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Chamberlain wanted to provide havens for Jewish refugees from Germany. So he suggested East Africa and British Guiana in South America — humid equatorial jungle lands full of snakes and wild beasts. The poor Jews are trying to get away from the snakes and wild beasts in Germany now. Mr. Chamberlain’s proposal is ironical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 11,600 refugees from Austria and Germany who have settled in Britain on guarantees that they had friends there and that they would not disturb employment have, in fact, increased it. They have been instrumental in employing 15,000 British workmen in the industries which they have set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesuits were terror-stricken lest the little Basque refugees should come to the United States and tell the truth about w'hat goes on in Spain, but Britain took thousands of them and still has some. A group of these little folks earned $1,500 in a three weeks’ tour of English cities, repeating dances which they learned in the home of their fathers, and this sum enables them to stay in hospitable England another winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sir Samuel Hoare, in addressing the House of Commons concerning the question of admitting more German Jews to England, said, “There is the making of a definite anti-Jewish movement.” The C. I. V. I. C. might do a little investigating as to the Jesuit influence back of this movement. Anti-Semitism has long been a feature of Catholic Action, and dates from the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet</span><span class="font5"> (Roman Catholic) explains that in the Middle Ages the Jew's were compelled to wear bright red to show their blood-guiltiness for Christ’s . death, but lights were poor in those days and on one occasion a cardinal embraced a Jew under the impression that he wms a fellow cardinal. That was tough on the Jew. The cardinal was so mad that he used his influence to have the Jews thereafter clothed in yellow instead of red, and that is how the Jew's came to w'ear yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anti-Semitism is a feature of al! the Rome-endorsed dictatorships, and is now' making its appearance in the United States through the influence of Priest Coughlin and his sheet “Social Justice”. The Jew's are in for a tough time everywhere if the Anglo-Fascjst-Nazi lineup ultimately reaches and includes the United States as an extension of Jesuitized Albion, which is not unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By no means all Britishers, as has been seen, are admirers of Na-zism and its Fuehrer. The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News-Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> of ztugust 27 said - facetiously ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congratulations to our brother in literature Adolf Hitler, whose be st-seller </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font5"> has just passed the 4,000,900 mark. Congratulations also to Otto Bopp, “Dusty” </span><span class="font4">Schnitzel</span><span class="font5">baum, Heinie Phigheimer, Frau Amalie (“Slogger”) Gumpels, </span><span class="font4">and Fritzie Dudelwasser, who were </span><span class="font5">overheard some </span><span class="font4">time </span><span class="font5">ago refusing to </span><span class="font4">buy a </span><span class="font5">copy and are now able to </span><span class="font4">get </span><span class="font5">around </span><span class="font4">in </span><span class="font5">bathchairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a trade exhibition at Dartford, Kent, Lord Hollenden, recently a guest of Hitler, was giving a lecture on the Press, in which he said, “The feeling is growing that we shall not get things right until we get control of the Press of the country”; whereupon one of .his auditors brought down the house by saying, “Send for Hitler.” Seriously, however, that seems not. necessary. All that seems needed is for Hitler to summon Chamberlain and tell him what he wants done, and it shall be as he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such protesting voices would, however, become weaker and fewer the more the Jesuit scheme for a bigger and more perfidious Albion progressed. Wait!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even a prime minister must not presume to speak out of turn. Learning that Chamberlain intended to deplore, in his speech, the vituperation of German press attacks on British statesmen, the entire Nazi diplomatic staff and fifteen German correspondents refused to attend the dinner of the Foreign Press Association in London, December 13. Ho tv’s that for lining them up </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> And don’t think that this was done without the knowledge and consent of Hitler and his advisors.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever the Jesuit scheme for Albion may envisage, it unquestionably includes provision for a dieta-tor ship in some form, even though lip-worship may continue to be given to “democracy”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British “Conservatives”, so called, seem not to be troubled by the forward march of Nazism and Fascism. Absorption of Memel by . Germany is but part of the process which these Conservatives call “unification”. They contend that Germans living in other countries have a right to self-determination. Absorption of Memel by Germany would be excused upon this pretext. Denmark will go soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what about the self-determination of the following towns absorbed by German}' in which the majority were Czechoslovakians:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Ambassadors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British ambassadors to Albania, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Venezuela arc Roman Catholics, and the wives of the ambassadors to France, Russia and Uruguay are Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was said at the League of Nations assembly that there would be no war in Europe as long as there was one small state left that eould be sacrificed. The process of unification, which the British Conservatives say should not be resisted, may in time lead Germany to demand Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. In each of these countries German or a Germanic language is spoken. Becoming stronger with each new acquisition, Germany may in time go so far as to demand the Scandinavian countries, as they are in line, being inhabited by Teutonic peoples. Even the French could, by a stretch of the linguistic principle, be included in the unification program, for in its language there are many German elements. Italy and Spain would in time seem only peninsular extensions of the Germanic mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Albion would be next; for is not the English race Aryan and its royal family largely of German blood? Certain members of the royal family are believed to be pro-Nazi. A noted English author, commenting on the proposed visit of the duke of Windsor to England, said, “If Edward, duke of Windsor, is brought back to England by Chamberlain, it is because Ed-jvard is a Nazi.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Last Stand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Jesuit priest, M. Oliver Semmes, of Kingston, Jamaica, expressed the - belief, in an interview with the Bos-^<sup>rave</sup>^<sup>er</sup>&gt; that the British Government is seriously considering the removal of its capital from London to Canada. The North American continent is English. If it could also be made Catholic it would be a far more imposing see than Rome ever was. Have the Jesuits thought of that also? Life is short, but art is long. London and England are not the most desirable location for the capital and center of a world empire or commonwealth. They are unhealthy and congested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population of Greater London, with its area of 693 square miles, increased from 6,580,000 in 1901 to 8,200,000 in 1938. Within this area are 229 open spaces of 50 acres or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the present falling birth rate in Britain continues for another thirty years, instead of there then being 7,500,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 18, there will he hut 4,500,000, a reduction of 40 percent. In one school in London the roll fell from 550 to 230 in four years. Some schools are being closed. Young people training to be teachers find it hard to get any work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The idea that the pope would even consider </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">moving </span><span class="font5">the center of Catholicism from Rome to America may seem preposterous to many. However, bear in mind that the Vatican is centuries old and in imminent danger of destruction by nature or man. Remember, too, that the pope’s headquarters were at one time in Franco, for seventy y^ars. But as to the British capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hendrik Willem Van Loon, world-famed author, in his book Our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Battle,</span><span class="font5"> says, “It is well within the realm of possibility that we shall </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5">the sleepy little town of Ottawa become the residence of the Royal Family and hear that what remains of the British Empire after Adolph Hitler gets through with it will henceforth be ruled from the heart of the new world. I realize that I am writing this at a moment when a terrific crisis has overtaken the world, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">crisis more serious than any other that has occurred since the end of the fifth century of our era, when the Roman government was no longer able to maintain itself in the ancient capital of the empire and transferred the centre of government from Rome to the city of Ravenna, which, being situated in the marshy plains of Eastern Italy, was less open to a surprise attack from the barbarians. If you and I live another ten years I feel convinced that we shall see a similar move on the part of the British government. For the London of the twentieth century is quite as vulnerable as the Rome of the fifth, only this time the danger will come from the air and not from the land or even the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How far the Jesuits will progress with their program before Armageddon overtakes them remains to bo seen. How successful they will be in balancing the more or less hostile forces of Fascism, Nazism and Albionism and coordinating them in a stand against Communism is also a question. That they will meet with a considerable degree of successdor a time the Scriptures foretell. But that their triumph will be brief is likewise predicted with certainty. Jesuitized Albion may go far, but the ultimate triumph is - reserved for him whose right it is, Christ Jesus, the Son and Vindicator of the Most High, Jehovah,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ There are several well-authenticated cases of where the demons have impersonated the living, which, of course, is quite as easy as impersonating the dead. All that is necessary, in either case, is to hypnotize the subject into seeing something that is not there. Empress Catherine, of Russia, was once impersonated in the chair of state; she cried out in horror at the scene, which was also clear to all in her party. There was one instance where a British statesman (Dr. ’Mark Antony Mac-donnell) was ill and did not leave his room for two days, and on both those days he was impersonated in the House of Commons and even voted in the division lobby. The poets Goethe and Shelley also personally met impersonations of themselves. Their minds were played upon into thinking they saw something which they did not see. This ability of these - “lying spirits” (1 Kings 22; 22) to lie direct to certain minds under certain circumstances is a most astonishing power for evil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The demons got Mrs. Silver al! worked up mentally to believe she was. going to be the recipient of a heaven-bom youngster, second child of the virgin Mary. But another couple, one of whom at least is a spirit medium (witch </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—-Bible)</span><span class="font5">, parted with one that, if it came from heaven, came by a roundabout route. But let Mrs. Silver tell her story, as in the Times-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The baby was given to her at about noon on July 11 after a voice spoke to her in a park and directed her to go to the end of the Chamberlayne Avenue bus line and wait there, Mrs- Silver said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I got off the bus and sat down to wait,” Mrs. Silver said. “July 11 was an awfully warm day, and the rays of the gun, together with the anticipation of what was about to transpire, soon bad my clothes wringing wet with perspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I waited until nearly 12 o’clock and was about to give up and go back, when I saw a little woman coining down a footpath toward me. She was alone and carried no packages. In fact, she seemed just an ordinary woman taking a walk. She was bareheaded, wore long hair well done up, dressed in a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY B, 1939 </span><span class="font5">purple dress with several different kinds of little flowers in it. She was very beautiful and seemed radiantly happy. She walked, past me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then suddenly she stopped and, turning to me she stretched forth her two hands, and right there before my eyes I saw the sweetest, most beautiful little baby precipitated fully clad in precious, most suitable baby clothes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As she handed it to me I felt a charge of electricity pass from her to me that felt something like it does if one accidentally sticks his finger in an electric light socket. She said, ‘Call her Barbara May. We will watch over her and she shall not want for anything.’ I looked down at the precious little baby in my arms and when I raised my eyes to thank the Lady Master from the Cosmic Spheres for her, she was gone and I saw her no more,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Immediately a cab unlike any I had ever seen before appeared and took me to Richmond . . . The baby is of the development of a two-months-old child just as I had been told by the Master in the Park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Two bottles of milk were handed me in a paper bag along with the baby with instructions as to the feeding time.”</span></p>

They invite their dupes to order the “Mighty I AM Presence” to give them any sums of money they require for use in their so-called “Service of the Light” and make no bones of flashing diamonds and other expensive jewels as evidence that their “Saint Germain” and “Ascended Masters” (the demons) will give them whatever they ask.

<p><span class="font5">At Colorado Springs, in the District Court of El Paso County, the action is brought in the name of Joseph F. Rutherford against nine Roman Catholie pastors and others of Colorado Springs, including the chief of police, local Catholic societies, certain lay and religious persons, and the newspaper corporation that is part owner of broadcasting station KVOR. The complaint alleges that the defendants . . , did maliciously concert and conspire together to, and did falsely and maliciously compose, write or cause to be written, and caused and procured to be published ... a certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">concerning Judge Rutherford. In Colorado Springs his speech '“Face the Facts” had been widely advertised to be broadcast September 11 over station KVOR, linked in a world-wide independent chain engaged to distribute the lecture as given by him that day in the Royal Albert Hall, London, England. The alleged defamatory statement, published just before the broadcast in the Colorado Springs </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Gazette and Telegraph,</span><span class="font5"> charges that “the broadcast of Judge Rutherford is an ignorant attack on Christianity”, “an insult to the citizens of the community” and that the speaker “widens his scope by attacking the American flag and the ideals it stands for in the hearts of the people of this country”. Claimed damages, $150,000.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Georgia a suit is filed also in the name of Judge Rutherford. It is pending in the Superior Court of Effingham County against the head of the Roman Catholic diocese comprising the entire State. The bill of complaint alleges that the defendant, Gerald Patrick O’Hara, bishop of Savannah-Atlanta,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">did falsely and maliciously compose, write or cause to be written, and caused and procured to be published ... a certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ticipating in a coast-to-coast chain broadcast on October 2, presenting the second of a series of speeches by Judge Rutherford. WATL did broadcast the entire program, ignoring the bishop’s letter, which asked the WATL manager to reject the broadcast because “this gentleman has been striving for years to destroy every form of religion”, “opposes not only the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Right after WBNS broadcast Judge Rutherford’s London speech September 11 the diocesan newspaper of Columbus published a long frontpage article and an editorial directing attention to that article and the action therein urged upon readers. Referring to Judge Rutherford, it described him as “the unspeakable ‘Judge' Rutherford”, “the unjudicial Judge,” “the so-ca lied ‘Judge’,” and labeled his broadcasting as “offensive stuff” and as an “insulting, false and evil broadcast”. In the article readers were provided with a form of letter to send to Detroit station WJR and other Columbus stations as well as WBNS, “to put Rutherford and his kind forever off the air.” The article urged:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Among the moving scenes described in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Soldiers of the Marshes, </span><span class="font5">by Langhoffs, we find the story of a Bible Student who in spite of harsh treatment and the most brutal'torture persistently refused to say “Heil Hitler”. The Bible Students, called also Jehovah’s witnesses, decline to give the Hitler salute and to accept the Fuehrer as their savior. This organization was formed in 1884 in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the United States of America, where it has numerous adherents. Such is also the case in other countries, notably in Germany. The purpose of its members is, by meeting and studying together, to acquire a thorough knowledge of the truths contained in the Bible. The members of the Society circulate the Holy Scriptures, as well as tracts commenting on the same. They believe the last judgment to be very near, and practice with the greatest earnestness the Christian doctrine that they “must obey God rather than men&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the conclusions of a court at Bade, their studies are based solely on the Christian faith. The chief of police, Baron Von Nordenfycht, on September 14, 1932, also confirmed the fact that their only object in meeting together is to examine Biblical questions. Doctors Barth and Stachelin, two professors of theology at Basle, Switzerland, in a report dated February 2, 1937, considered Jehovah’s witnesses as being interested in Biblical prophecies, and as, above all, being diligent to publish the message of the kingdom of God, and as taking no part whatever in politics. To say that they have the slightest connection with Communism is a false and baseless accusation, and must rest on a willful misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bcfpre the rise of the Third Reich a Nazi schoolmaster named Schemm, who later became minister of public worship, and later still , was killed in an airplane accident, threatened Jehovah’s witnesses at Munich in these terms: “When we get into power we shall quickly finish with you.” That is the only promise that the National Socialists have kept. They have indeed ferociously persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses. Since 1933 over 6,000 members of this organization have been incarcerated in prisons, houses of correction, and concentration camps, where they steadfastly resist the Nazi terrorists, and openly declare themselves resolved to remain faithful to their belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another work, bearing the title “Crusade Against Christianity”, has been published in the German language by Franz Ziireher at Zurich, Switzerland. This account of the sufferings of persecuted men and women is free from all artifice, and is a tale plainly told. Yet so moving is it that it constitutes one of the most terrible accusations that can be brought against the demoniacal rulers of the Third Reich. These accusations would be even more eloquent if the author ha J forborne to mix them with polemics against the numerous and the powerful enemies of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■The German association of Jehovah’s witnesses was dissolved in June, 1933. Its books. and booklets were burned, its property confiscated, and its adherents thrown into prison and dragged off to concentration camps. Men who refused to give the Hitler salute have been discharged by their employers. In the case of one worker this took place after 33 years’ service. The pensions of disabled soldiers have been discontinued, and they have been ironically advised to ask Jehovah for food to eat. Their tormentors have sought to compel Jehovah’s witnesses to accept that Hitler is sent by God, and their underlings have shouted at their victims the words taken from one of the works of the German poet Heine, “Jehovah, be assured of my eternal scorn. Great Babylon’s king am I.” This second book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity,</span><span class="font5"> shows that hundreds of victims have been charged and haled before the courts, and have then been condemned to varying terms of imprisonment, extending to sentences of five years, for:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) Having studied the Bible together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(2)</span><span class="font5"> Having celebrated the memorial of Christ’s death at a meeting of three people, consisting of a married couple and one of their friends.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">(3) Having distributed tracts explaining the Scriptural prophecies.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">One of the most atrocious things done is to deprive the Bible Students of their children, and to place these latter in a boarding school, or even in a house of correction for youthful criminals.

<p><span class="font5">If Franco had known on July 17, 1936, what he knows today, would-he have started the revolt against the Spanish Republic? We are inclined to doubt it. What was to have been a coup d’etat with German and Italian help has become one of the hardest fought civil wars in history and threatens— should the insurgents win — to undermine Spanish independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Primo de Rivera had found it easy enough to gag Parliamentary institutions under the monarchy and establish a dictatorship ; Franco must have expected as easy a time with the Republic. The officers of the army and navy were with him; German and Italian help was forthcoming at once. Victory seemed certain, but the Spanish civil war has lasted almost half as long as the World War, and the Republic has not yet fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The resistance of Spain’s badly armed, ragged militia and the anti-Fascist volunteers that came to her aid from the world over will some day be universally recognized, whatever one’s sympathies, for the heroic struggle that it is. The Republic has fought not only its own insurgents, but Germany and Italy; and it has fought them with one hand tied behind its back by the cruel farco of “nonintervention”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We wonder how many on Franco’s side are not secretly regretful; the divisions between Right and Left in Spain were deep, but not too deep to be bridged without bloodshed. The arrogance of the German and Italian troops, bearing themselves as conquerors rather than as allies, has sown hatred among the insurgents. The defeat of the Italians at Guadalajara by Spanish troops and Italian anti-Fas-eists caused secret satisfaction among Franco’s own men. Premier Negrin’s Thirteen Point broadcast to the insurgents has aroused responsive echoes.

This generation has never witnessed anywhere in the world a struggle for democracy and the right to a decent destiny that so clearly and so richly deserved the deepest sympathy of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider that a short twenty years ago, on a great wave of outraged civic righteousness, we took up arms and crossed an ocean to do battle for “world democracy”. Now, when every democracy and quasi-democracy in the world is being far more seriously threatened than they were then, our Government has covertly and underhandedly taken sides with the murderers of Spanish democracy, and we, the American people, are standing completely stultified before the world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And how was that national disgrace, this stealthy betrayal of democracy, brought about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font5">It was brought about by the machinations of that coterie of snobs infesting the State Department known as “career diplomats”. These admirers of Franco represent American democracy no more than Al Capone and his gangsters represented American democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And yet it is impossible not to see that the president has allowed the secretary of state to allow this little gang of underlings, who acknowledge no responsibility to the people, to exercise an authority that should be trusted to the hands of only the highest responsible officials. Is it possible that the secretary of state, unwilling to soil his own hands, was yet ' willing enough for the dirty job to be done by his underlings?

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE leading politician of the majtjr political party in America and who confesses to being a religionist recently said: “We must pursue the good neighbor policy” and, further, avoid saying anything that might offend the religious susceptibilities of others. That American politician also recently said: “We must have religious freedom, and this government guarantees religious liberty.” At the same time this same great politician ably supports Cardinal Mundelein, which gentleman of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy advises and incites others to persecute wickedly and maliciously ill-treat the true followers of Christ Jesus because such persecuted ones do not sup-■ port the Catholic Hierarchy but instead serve God and Christ. Cardinal Mundelein is a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font5"> power in the political affairs of the nation because he influences many votes. It is truly said that polities makes strange bedfellows. Is it the proper exercise of “the good neighbor policy” to connive with and support religious organizations and the strong men therein who persecute the true Christians or anyone else? It certainly is not. Politicians do many strange things that they may have the political support of others, particularly of influential men in religious organizations. If the Roman Catholic Hierarchy were politically weak in the United States that same chief politician would completely ignore them. The purpose of the Hierarchy is to silence all persons and prevent them from exposing the , Hierarchy while the Hierarchy pursues its selfish course of depriving the people of their God-given rights. The Hierarchy receives aid from the politicians in silencing honest and sincere persons, and, in turn, the Hierarchy , renders political aid to the politicians. From the politicians’ viewpoint “the good neighbor policy” is a convenient means of preventing the truth from being told, which exposes the wrongs of a strong political-religious organization. “The good neighbor policy,” not being</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">understood by the people generally, sounds well, and by insisting on the “good neighbor policy” as understood by politicians it works well for both religionists and politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fi|st question is, Who is your neighbor? What is the true good neighbor policy ? A Christian’s neighbor is anyone who believes on and serves Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. God’s second great commandment repeated specifically by Jesus concerning sueh says: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” (Matt. 19:19) That means to unselfishly render good unto all persons who sincerely serve God and obey His righteous law. Could a person render good to his fellow creature who believes in God by shunning and avoiding telling the truth ? No, assuredly not; because it is everyone’s duty who believes in God to help his neighbor or fellow creature to have a better understanding of God and His Word. Jesus declares that everyone who hears and obeys him must tell the truth. (John 18:37) What is meant by telling the truth ? It means to tell others what is written in the Word of God, because of Cfcd’s Word Jesus says: “Thy word is truth.” (John-17:17) A person does his neighbor good by pointing out the pitfalls and snares which the Devil has set for men, and this he is commanded to do if he really loves his fellow creature. The real good-neighbor policy could not mean the hindering of one from hearing the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures clearly point out that the Devil set up religion to mock and defame the Almighty God and to ensnare men. The Devil blinds the understanding of selfish men so that they cannot see and appreciate the truth of God’s Word. (2 Cor. 4:4) Religious institutions or organizations which are managed and carried on by selfish men draw into such institutions many persons of good will but who by reason of being held in these religious institutions are kept in blindness to the truth of God’s Word. The commandment of Jehovah to those who serve Him is to go and tell others who desire to hear the truth as set forth in His Word and to warn them against Satan’s religious snares. (Ezek. 33:7-9) Those who love God and their fellow men, their neighbors, must obey God by telling God’s Word of truth. The proclaiming of God’s Word of truth exposes the Devil’s snares and necessarily exposes religious systems, which operate in the name of the Lord but which are mocking God’s holy name and arc against His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the so-called “good neighbor policy” of the politicians is followed, what is the result? The Devil’s religious institutions led by. the great-Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which seeks to grab control of the nations and t* rule the people arbitrarily, are permitted to pursue their selfish and wicked work without the people’s being informed as to how they must protect themselves therefrom. Therefore the politicians’ “good neighbor policy” is really a snare. If everyone remained silent and said nothing that might shock the religious susceptibilities of religious leaders the people must continue to suffer with no possibility of knowing how to escape. The so-called “good neighbor policy” announced by politicians te-comes a vicious policy working injury and destruction to one’s neighbor. Only the truth as taught by God’s Word and directed by and through Christ Jesus can make men free from such oppression. (John 8:32,86) No good and reasonable person will be deceived by the sophistry of the religio-political advocates of their so-called “good neighbor policy”. One’s safe guide is to study and to give heed to the Word of God and thereby learn to do good unto all men that desire good.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Mq^se, Caribou and Deer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font5">THE American moose is a powerful animal, standing sometimes as high as seven feet at the shoulders. It is long-haired, the hair being about three inches long. It has a horn spread that sometimes exceeds six feet. The “palm” of the horn is usually from twelve to sixteen inches wide and lias many points. The young of the moose are not graceful, but rather awkward. They stand about 32 inches high and at first have a coat of sandy-red hair. The adult moose may attain to a weight of 1500 pounds, though that is exceptional. Usually they weigh from 1000 to 1200 pounds. They are found in small numbers in Minnesota and along the coastal side of the Rockies, but arc more numerous in Canada and Alaska. In the United States hunters may kill only one male per season, and the open seasons are short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wolf is an enemy of the moose, but a cautious one. It will rarely attack' in loose snow, as the sharp hoofs of the moose are an effective weapon. When the snow is crusted, however, the wolf has an advantage, remaining on top while the moose breaks through and is easily worsted by a pack of wolves, who know' how to hamstring the moose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mating call of the moose in the autumn season is a startling thing. Long, loud and hoarse sounds the call, and the challenge, of the majestic beast. .It is a challenge, because other moose are also looking and calling for mates. The competition often occasions sanguinary battles, as in the case of other members of the deer family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Caribou &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a species of wild reindeer in Canada called caribou. These provide food and clothing for Arctic natives. The stags roam far, but the doos and'fawns remain in groups. These .have gray or light-brown coats of hair. The summer coat is acquired in July, the hair being long and soft, and white at the roots. The white part lengthens, while the increasingly brittle dark tips break off. Then when winter comes they have a white coat to match the seen cry and make them less conspicuous to their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These caribou are migratory, traveling southward in winter to the edge of the Ca-nadiah forests in huge herds. Day and night</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 8, 1939 </span><span class="font5">for about three weeks they travel past a given point. About five million caribou roam the territory between the Mackenzie river and the eastern -Arctic plains, coming from the northwest and swimming the Yukon river. They spend almost half the year in the vast Hudson Bay section, of which little is known. Here they live in the extreme cold of the Arctic winter night, moving about with only the lights of the moon and the northern sky shining upon the vast expanse of snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The semiannual migrations of caribou are the harvest season of the Eskimo and northern Indians, Almost every part of the animal is utilized in some way, whether for food, clothing or implements and bedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are still a few caribou left in the United States, although they are hard to find, remaining only in those parts of the country that are almost inaccessible, chiefly in Minnesota and Maine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conserving Deer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conservation departments of certain states provide for deer in times of scarcity by distributing cakes made of molasses and soy-bean meal. These are attached to trees, and balsam boughs draped over the^in some cases to attract the deer. The animals soon discover that the cakes are good to eat, and form lines to get their share, a cake-line, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The advance of “civilization” has resulted in greatly decreasing the number of deer in America, as well as elsewhere. Hunting deer for sport is restricted by game laws in many states. But how it could be any real sport to rob of its life such a beautiful and graceful thing as a deer is hard to comprehend. Necessity, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">possibly.</span><span class="font5"> Sport, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Transferring deer from one place to another to increase their number has proved successful in a number of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">remarkable trek of reindeer under the supervision of drivers was recently undertaken between Nabaktooli, Alaska, and the Mackenzie River section of Canada. Stops en route were necessary for fawning, and the trek took five years. While 3,000 deer started out, only 2,300 reached their destination; but even so, the transfer may be considered a remarkable success and will provide a livelihood for the now underfed and impoverished Eskimos in that section of Canada.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Out of the wreckage and consternation and graves and ashes left in the wake of the World War, the present ele'ver and sagacious pope conceived and brought forth that new and terrible form of irresponsible government known as Fascism. The Fascist war lords often quarrel with the pope. Their fellowship of blood and iron does not always work in perfect harmony. But it rivals the‘Huns and Tartars and Turks as a scourge of civilization and human rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has announced to the world a fighting alliance with Japan. It has already gone far towards sweeping liberty and democracy from continental Europe. It startles the world with its unprovoked war on the peaceful and unoffending Chinese Republic. Its war to exterminate government by the people in Spain appears near final j^ctory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Months ago the Fascist spearhead was thrusf into the New World. American reaction to the Fascist revolution in Brazil alarmed the Papacy. The Roman Catholic periodicals quickly denied that the new dictatorship in that country is Fascism. But the original press reports are unshaken by the denial. Behavior of Vargas is so much like that of Hitler and Mussolini as to demonstrate the common spirit and character of their bloody and oppressive rule. —Judge Gilbert 0.

<p><span class="font5">♦ Everything that can be said of the extreme cruelty and bloody barbarism which the rebels practice is small compared with the real truth. In the first two weeks of the rebellious movement, in Valladolid alone, there were recorded three thousand executions, and in Zaragoza more than four thousand. In Burgos the executions continue, with the most cruel methods, of those affiliated with party organizations and workmen’s clubs and members of the republican parties. In all these cities men have been burned at the stake with a pyre of so-ealled “hereticaP’iooks, taken from the archives and the librarfll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All that has been said of the slaughters </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Badajoz is small compared with the. reality there recorded. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">large erowd of laborers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">poor folks took refuge in the cathedral, believing that the right of asylum of the church would protect them from the rebels. . . . They were taken out from the sacred place and executed. Never before have such acts of barbarism been committed. From the cathedral square they were taken to the bull-ring wherein the terrible massacre took place which has amazed world opinion. Anything that may be said regarding the crimes perpetrated in Badajoz once this region fell into the rebel hands, as monstrous as it may seem, is far from the truth; for the-reality is much more tragic. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">has never been witnessed before; history does not record such precedents in the most barbaric peoples.

For that reason they have been repeatedly expelled from almost every country in the world, including Spain, the country of origin. Franco the Butcher has now issued a decree that they return to Spain and resume their practices in the territory under his control. The place where the Jesuits daily conspire to destroy each and every part of the United States government and the government of the state and the city of New York is located in the Wool worth Building, Broadway, New York city.

<p><span class="font5">He hoped to be able to send a little story to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gonsulation</span><span class="font5"> about his visit to the Vatican, so I just wish to briefly mention that incident. It was in 1512, which was, I believe, prior to the pontificate of the present pious, political pontiff, but even then they had some interesting proceedings at the previous pontiff’s pontifical palace. He saw the vicar on hie vicarious throne, and. had the opportunity of kissing the papal peda! extremities, but was not even tempted. This evidently displeased the guards, because they hustled him outside so fast he could not get A satisfactory view of the gorgeous splendor of the royal room occupied by the [so-called] ‘representative of the One who had not where to Jay His head*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the grounds outside of the building, things were different. More time was allowed him, because many vendors of holy wares and relies were plying their trade. I am sorry that I cannot recount them one by one as on a rosary, just as he was “touched” by these merchants of the Vatican,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Down to this point </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">believes Dr. Eames 100 percent, but when it comes to the rest of it, he must have the “Appetizers” column mixed with this page, but, anyway, this is what he says:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The best I can do is to offer a few suggestions as to the precious antiques that were offered him, as I am not sure [Doctor!

<p><span class="font5">However, probably and more appropriately [says Eames, warming to his subject] they were also offering such specialties as rattles from the serpent’s tail found in Eden ‘five million years ago*, the corner stone of the Tower of Babel, Nimrod’s favorite spear and fishhook, Korah’s rod that did not bud, Pharaoh’s last year’s license plates [f] found on the shores of the Red sea, Goliath’s wrist watch showing the exact hour at which he was pebble-dashed through the windshield of his helmet which was not equipped with shatterproof glass, what was left of Sennacherib’s army the day after the night before, or what was left of Caesar’s seal on Christ’s tomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At any rate they did not try to sell him the Brooklyn Bridge or Judge Rutherford’s books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The voice of justice has come from the Vatican. Never before hag such whole-hearted support of Japan’s present action in China been given outside the nation. Furthermore, the significance of the Holy See’s instructions lies in the fact that there are almost four hundred million Roman Catholics to whom the Vatican’s word is law. Thus it may be said that one-fourth of the population of the world is supporting Japan in the China incident.. &gt;, The Catholic Church has supported us, has urged us to fight for the prevention of Communist penetration in Asia.

<p><span class="font5">This whole flag-saluting idea as applied to school legislation seems to have got off on the wrong foot. If the idea be to instill reverence for the flag in school children, then punishing them for failure to salute where failure is of religious' origin, is stupid. The child’s mind is asked to choose between loyalty to the flag and loyalty to God. If the choice is for the latter, reverence has really won out, after all. And reverence is itself more important than a mere physical gesture toward the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As a </span><span class="font5">matter of fact, the group ridicule incurred by the rebel against the group mores in the average school is pretty cruel. It is more than punishment enough upon a child who, in obedience to his training from his parents, refuses to do something that everybody else seems to be doing. Of course, as the Pennsylvania judge appears to have realized, if religious scruple calls for a downright interference with the school schedule, that is a different matter. Religious liberty in this country does not extend to the point of licensing a religionist to interfere with the liberty of another. But we must not forget that religious liberty is one of the things the flag stands for. We can afford to be pretty tolerant while we remember that.—Dallas </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">828 7th 'Ave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">San Diego, Calif. Jan. 2, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font5">Bari Strebe, Manager Palm Springs Theater Palm Springs, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Mr. Strebe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Agreeable to our conversation .of December 24, last, on which date my wife and I witnessed the film “Heart of the North” at your theater, I am repeating my complaint expressed verbally to you. During this performance 1 noted the introduction of a Roman Catholic priest as a character in the picture; and since this actor contributed nothing to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">forward action of the drama, it was‘clear that the portrayal was for the glorification of the Catholic church in the eyes of the innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is against the introduction of this form of nauseous propaganda into amusement films that I protest. Besides many-obvious reasons why this practice should be distasteful I feel impelled to write you. because it is not an isolated example. During the same week I saw “King for a Day”, in which the same redundant use of a priest was Superimposed on the plot, no such character appearing in the usual Francois Villon story. In the cinema “Christmas Carol”, a picturization of the story by Charles Dickens, which was running this same week at your Plaza Theater, appears a church scene which simulates the Catholic church more than the Anglican. The many statements of Dickens deploring Roman Catholicism leads to the belief that had the author been alive and present he would have departed the theater in disgust at such a paltry trick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You yourself are familiar with the extensive addition of Catholicism to films. Although not a frequent movie-goer myself, I recall the subtle use of this in such films as “California”, “Hurricane,” “Shining Hour,” “Lost Horizon,” “The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel ” “Angels with Dirty Faces,” in most instances an addition to the original plot. I am sure you could add many titles to this list. Indeed I am told by many cinema fans the pictures without Catholic church advertisements are the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In regard to the above I wish to make my position clear. I am not a religionist of any sort;-and even if I were, I am sure I would not go to the movies to get any brand of religion. What I go for, and what I am sure the overwhelming majority of others go for, is to be relaxed. If the cinemas performed this implied obligation of amusing the public they would be rendering a service to a nerve-strained world; but when they permit- themselves to become the purveyors of somebody else’s spoiled goods their popularity, usefulness, and even existence, for entertainment purposes, is doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By “somebody else’s spoiled goods” I mean the proposition that Catholicism is a benevolent, charitable, and hence worthy organization. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, or the authoritative control of the Catholic church, is the most vicious political group under the sun. Pushing their political schemes under the supposedly church movement called “Catholic Action” they are fast gaining ascendancy over the nations of the earth. Papal alliances with Mussolini, Hitler, Franco, the Japanese emperor, and probably Chamberlain, has about “settled the hash” of Europe. The Catholic-Faseist-tota liter ian combine thus hold most of Europe and Asia in slavish submission. The Papal fight against Communism is but a smoke screen; “Communism” defined by the pope is anything contrary to the forward move of Catholic aggressions, and is made a blind and excuse to attack such opponents of her allies as the Spanish Loyalists, the Hussites of Czechoslovakia, and the Chinese. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Anything</span><span class="font5"> is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">red &lt;&nbsp;that is anti-Catholic!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">proof of these statements I am sending a magazine composed of newspaper accounts exposing the real objectives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. These disclosures of such world-wide conspiracies will not surprise students of the history of this infamous gang. Martin Luther, over four hundred years ago, as a priest of the Catholic cloister, turned them up as vicious liars hiding the real truth of the Bible from the Catholic population. Other brave men followed Luther’s example, and most of these objectors met a cruel fate at the hands of the Roman Catholic Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is not the place to describe several hundred years of crime. But witness the fact that the Hierarchy does not change, and popes always bless their henchmen just as the present officeholder adds his benediction to the crimes of Mussolini, Franco, and Hitler, to mention the most outstanding. Attention is called to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the fact that there is complete aceord between Hitler and the pope despite the newspaper accounts of Catholic persecution in Germany. (See leading article in magazine enclosed under separate cover.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These facts are brought out because of their direct relation to the effort in America above referred to, which has for its object the forcing down the throats of Americans such Catholic rigmaroles, from which our ancestors fled to escape and which are riling even in pieturi-zation. There arc an abundance of Catholic churches that one can attend if he desires this thing. I believe I speak the sentiment of the majority when I say that I do not go to the movies to be converted, nor to be propagan</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dize^ </span><span class="font5">by any form of superstition that appeals to an organization with a centuries-old crime record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is in keeping with their conspiracy to control the whole earth that the Hierarchy injects pictures of its representatives into films. Through the medium of cinemas with theaters all over the world and the audiences for each picturization running into the millions, and by means of benign roles for priests and nuns, the Hierarchy expects to silence much criticism and cultivate many admirers among the uninitiated. Why are the producers falling for this scheme wholesale? Is it not an indication that America is following suit of the Fascist states where everything is censored and doc-’ tored ? As one citizen, I protest this abuse and call attention to it as further evidence that American liberties are being endangered. Had not America better awake and remember the Rome that drove their kindred to these shores?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in favor of liberty without propaganda,</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>The Political Situation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">„• The terrible action of Germany against the Jews which has shocked and startled the world has greatly discounted the hopes of those who expected so much from the Munich agreement betweerf the British premier and Hitler. The world is getting accustomed to the terrible records of the wars, served up daily by the newspapers, and exploited by some of them; but , there is no question that Germany’s action shocked it out of its almost easy acceptance of these things. Modern warfare waged on civilian populations has hurt the world, but the apparent impossibility of preventing the ruthlessness has brought a feeling of helplessness, and, in turn, one of acceptance almost as when the suffering is caused by a convulsion of nature. The &quot;civilized” world, which flatters itself on its advancement, as it reads of the horrors perpetrated during the Dark Ages when Papal Rome was ascendant, had told itself that all those things were for ever in the past. Now a great nation, themselves held in the bonds of a hard dictatorship, has committed arid is committing acts of cruelty which are comparable to those of the dark, cruel past. Hitler believes in “purging” as a remedy. When he wanted to get rid of some who were in opposition to him, and were in the way of his advancement, he caused that which recent history knows as the &quot;bloody purge”, and it is credibly recorded that he took a personal share in the murder of his former personal friend and aide. Now his State must be purged of the race whom he and his fellow rulers have made themselves believe are a eurse to Germany. The world is aghast at his method. What Hitler has done to the Jews is news, and the newspapers spread themselves over it. But Hitler’s actions towards Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are as cruel as these which the world is now told of. Known there as “Earnest Bible Students”, most of them of truer German blood than Hitler, they have been most shamefully ill-treated and most inhumanely manhandled, some of them done to death in the coneentration camps where thousands of them have been imprisoned, their 'offense’ being their refusal to acknowledge Hitler’s Nazi State as supreme, and to give the Hitler salute as representing obedience to him in all things. They will not give to Hitler that which belongs to God alone, and they give the Bible’s witness to the present establishment of the kingdom of God. Once and again the newspapers mention the case of Niemoeller, the pastor of a congregation, who, because he will not promise to give Hitler preeminence in worship, is kept in close confinement. The religious journals in Britain keep his case prominent; but neither these journals nor the newspapers (with a few exceptions) give a mention to Jehovah’s witnesses who thus suffer, and from the actions of the Roman Catholic organization, and words written and spoken by some of its prominent members, it would be well pleased if Herr Hitler purged his country of these in his regular w<sup>r</sup>ay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is evident that the world is getting its senses dulled: the daily portion of news of war murders and atrocities perpetrated by order and routine have their effect. Judge Rutherford in his treatment and explanations of the prophecies of Scripture, and Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth, have for many years endeavored to call the attention of all men to the fact that the Day of Jehovah is here, and that His judgments must soon fall upon the inhabitants of the earth, even as His prophets foretold. In his call to the world from the Royal Albert Hall the judge showed that the time of the fulfillment of Jesus’ words when He said, <sup>f</sup>As the days of Noah were, so shall the days of the Son of Man be,’ is come. Certairfly there is hardly a restful place in the whole earth, and certainly it is being filled with violence.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Facing the Facts</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• Since the day, Sunday, September 11, 1938, when Judge Rutherford called upon London, and Britain, and all the English-speaking world, to face the facts, and in the Royal Albert Hall delivered his warning of the danger threatening the peoples from the totalitarian monster—the exaltation of the State as supreme power over the bodies and minds of men, and the association of the Hierarchy of Authority in Rome with the dictators—the words “Face the Facts” have been in common use by those who have something they want to emphasize. The judge’s speech put the words in a special setting; no doubt the Devil wants to discount the warning and the message which was then given, by diverting attention. The latest use noted is a six-page folder (10 by 7^ inches), boldly scribed in red, issued by the Conservative party on behalf of Mr. Chamberlain. Since the relief of the first days after the Munich agreement the country has not been certain that lasting gain accrued to Britain from that agreement, and the Labor party, it is said, has started a campaign to discount it and the premier’s services. The Conservatives now call on the people to face the facts, the main one being that war was averted. There are many facts to be faced in both the domestic and the international relations of the State, but the one with the greatest danger to state, and to people is burked; nor vyjll the people face the fact of the menace of the Papal schemes to assert themselves and get control in Britain as in past days. There is no power on earth so active and so persistent in seeking its objective as the Roman Churcii, and it is the world’s most subtle menace.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>Forgetting the Devil</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• A writer in a religious journal, puzzled by the decline in religion, and the increase of violence in the earth, asks, “Have we forgotten the Devil?” Of course they have, all the lot of them, particularly the so-called “Protestant” section. They willingly forgot him; for their philosophies have no place for Satan,' the Devil. As a subject, the Devil is not fashionable in these enlightened days. The Devil, the great deceiver of the nations, did a great thing for himself when he got religionists to drop al] talk of him, and of what is “said in the Scriptures, and actually got most of them to believe there is no sueh creature. But in this day of enlightenment, when the Scriptures are being made plain, and the message of Truth is going abroad in the earth, the part this set enemy of God and Christ and of righteousness has in the events now happening in the earth and among men is made clear. That is one reason why he is so active through his chief agents in trying to suppress the witness of the truth. He is exposed, and he hates the light.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Fascism</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• Fascism in England is nearer to realization than most people suspect.

Perhaps there is but little danger of Britain turning into a Fascist State such as is seen in Italy. But the weakness' of democracy in the face of totalitarian dictators has been exposed: force must be met with force, since force is that which rules in this unrighteous world. A democracy has perforce to place itself under the absolute rule when war comes, as was definitely proved by the Great War. The so-called “National Government” which now controls the country is gradually bringing in a sort of Fascist rule. There is a clear indication that many politicians want to get a general register of the people, to register labor, and certainly if war threatened there would be industrial conscrip-tionyThe Sedition Act, passed some years ago, is capable of much misuse, and censorship of the Press is creeping on, aided by an Act^which was never intended to be used for purposes other than to prevent or to catch spies in the service of possible enemy countries.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Air Raid Precaution</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• Belief that gas masks are unlikely to be of real service in the event of an air raid is gaining ground. The greatest danger to life is expected to be from the use of incendiary and explosive bombs. The nations that have adopt-; ed the “non-intervention” policy in the Spanish rebellion, as well as those actively engaged (though professing non-intervention), have been learning <sup>-f</sup>how to do it” when the next great war comes—as they expect it will come when all the preparations for peace are made. Besides the fact that gas as a means of destruction is not as effective as the other kinds of bombs, there are difficulties in preparation; and the effect is not so spectacular and therefore not as fearsome as explosion and fire. The chief p'urpose is to create panic and to cause the people to clamor for peace at almost any price. To cause the wholesale slaughter of a people would suit the Devil: ho would destroy all men rather than that any should hear the message of Jehovah’s provision and they should turn to<sup>r</sup> Him.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>“On the Make”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• The Roman Catholic population of Liverpool is a very considerable proportion of the whole, in great measure because of immigration of Irish peoplb. The “holy church” is making a strong bid for its future there, and to influence all Lancashire. A great cathedral, already “dedicated to Christ the King”, is in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">process of building. It is to be a metropolitan cathedral, and when finished (!), 25 years hence, it will be exceeded in size only by St. Peter’s in Home. The cost is heavy, but a very wel] organized system of begging is in operation. The pennies of the poor are consistently gathered, and no Roman Catholic in that neighborhood can hope to escape the nuns and the priests of the diocese. The “holy church” is not expecting Christ the King to come in the power of His kingdom, as He said He would do: it expects to continue, and ultimately to rule fully in the earth, and this particular building is expected to last a long time. One of the schemes for getting money for its construction is a bold assumption of the Divine order. The Roman Catholic papers in Britain carry an announcement that a “Book ox Remembrance” is open for entries. A donor of £1 haS his name inscribed in this “Golden Book of Remembrance”, “to endure for all ■ time” ; “the book will remain within the precincts of a glorious temple built on the sacrifices of all classes.” The donors have a share in the benefits of two weekly masses, one monthly, and one yearly. The scheme has been widened to allow more money to get into it: now the names of the dead may be entered, on payment of the stipulated amount. To help things along, a similar book is there for the young; they can get in for 5/-. As a support to this scheme the local “holy fathers” have the audacity to quote Malachi 3:16: “And a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.” The difference between these is that one is written before the Lord, and the others are not; and the difference is such as to make the imitation almost like blasphemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wisdom from the Young</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• When Jesus had made His “triumphal entry” into Jerusalem lie went on to the temple. He cast out of its courts the sellers and the buyers who were trading there; he overturned the tables of the moneychangers, and of them that sold doves. He said to these and to those responsible for the house of God, “Ye have made it a den of thieves.” The blind and the lame came to Him to be healed; “and he healed them all:” While this was happening the children continued the song of praise and prayer, “Hosanna to the son of David,” with which He had been met on the way into the city. The healing of the blind and lame could hardly be made a cause of objection, but the vexed leaders, the chief priests and scribes, called His notice to what the children were crying out, and implied He should stop them. Jesus replied that He heard what the children were singing, and said, “Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” which answer was a heavy blow at those haughty men, intimating as it did, that they and their like were not those of whom God accepted praise. The circumstances of those days are being repeated. The time of judgment is come, and the final clash between the self-righteous, haughty religious leaders and the witness of the Lord’s disciples; the witnesses to Jehovah are doing the works of God. Their children are learning fast, and are witnessing with their parents, and arc singing the song of prayer and praise to the Lord. In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study at the latest united meeting of the Greater London company (study of November 1 issue), when the leader put the question, “Would it be proper for the Jonadabs to begin now to ‘fill the earth’, to marry and rear children ?” immediately the piping voice of a boy said, “Definitely, No!” The answer was so surely spoken as to surprise and give much pleasure to the company. The boy is in his eleventh year, gets his own </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> studies it and marks it for his guidance, and shares with his mother in the joys of the Lord. The psalmist’s words, the words of the spirit of God, may be allowed to have a figurative application, but Jesus gave them a very literal application of fulfillment; and surely they are again being literally fulfilled, for young children are entering into and are taking the place of the “wise and prudent” leaders of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Saints</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• It seems that the present pope may hold the record in making “saints”. It is stated that he has now “beatified” 42 dead persons, and has “sanctified” 30 others. When he recently “beatified” three dead women a re lie of each was carefully preserved ; and in good time, according to the pleasure of the pope and the policy of the Hierarchy, two or three “miracles”, probably of “healing”, would have been wrought in connection with the relic. This would have “proved” that the dead one has got out of “purgatory” into heaven. Then at the pleasure of a pope the “beatified” one would be elevated to the glory of “saintship”, and another added to the number of “heavenly suppliants of Mary”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Airplane Stalling Signal</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Everybody knows that to keep a bicycle upright it is necessary that it be in motion. .When the cyclist stops pedaling or coasting the machine tips over. Much the same principle is involved in the safety of an airplane. It is safe while it is in motion upon the air. It stalls when the attempt is made to fly the wing at too steep an angle to the oncoming air, and an unintentional stall at a low altitude almost inevitably results in a crash. A Hew apparatus now sounds a horn, or turns on a light, or shakes the control stick or rudder pedal the moment the plane is in danger of becoming stalled. This should mark an important step forward in safety of flying.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The regular American air traffic has 362 planes in operation, with an average daily ‘ flight per plane of slightly over 500 miles, at an average speed of 152 miles per hour. There are four pilots and copilots per plane, nine ✓mechanics and riggers per plane, and an office 'personnel even larger. Of the trips scheduled, 88.44 percent are completed, and 5 percent more are started but not finished, due to unfavorable weather conditions.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Near Seattle the giant Boeing clipper ercat-ed an artificial rainbow by dumping 1,500 gallons of water from a height of a mile, to test the action of the gasoline dump valves. This ship, one of six sister ships, is intended to carry up to 35,000 pounds in its 24-hour flight across the Atlantic, and has demonstrated its ability to lift and carry such a load.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent In the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark15"></a>NEUTRALITY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&quot;—John 17:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">J</span><span class="font9">EHOVAH is the God of peace: “The God of peace be with you all.” (Rom. 15:33) “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.” (1 Thess. 5:23) Jehovah is not a pacifist, as that word is generally defined. In his own due time Jehovah makes war against those who blaspheme his name and defy Him and who oppose The Theocracy. “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” (Rom. 16:20) Jehovah God is always neutral in a controversy or war between nations or peoples who are on the side of Satan and a part of Satan’s world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Christ Jesus is “the Prince of Peace”, and when his kingdom is fully in operation there will be no end to peace. (Isa. 9:6,7; Heb. 7:1,2) But Christ Jesus is not a pacifist. In God’s due time and at God’s command he makes war upon Satan and all of his organization and will completely destroy all the wicked. (Rev. 19:11; Ps. 110:2-4) When there is a controversy or war between those who are of Satan’s organization Christ Jesus is always neutral as to the contending sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> “Neutrality” means to decline or refuse to engage in a controversy or war which is between others, and particularly when such warring nations are unfriendly to the neutral one. In such controversies or wars the neutral one does not take the part of either side, but refuses to take up the fight of one as against the other; and this is particularly true where the neutral one has no just cause to interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">* The position of Jehovah’s witnesses should be clearly and definitely defined, and that position must be fully supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah’s witnesses are Christians, who follow the lead of Christ Jesus their Head in obeying the commandments of the Almighty God, and who are therefore wholly and entirely devoted to the kingdom of God, which is The Theocracy. The mere fact that one claims to be a Christian does not mean that he is in fact a Christian. His course of action must prove his claim. A Christian is one who has fully covenanted to do the will of Almighty God and therefore to be obedient to God’s commandments even as Christ Jesus, the beloved and exalted Son of God, obeys Jehovah’s commandments. As Christ Jesus is, so are his followers, Jehovah’s witnesses, in this world.—1 John 4:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> There is now war among some of the nations of earth. Some of the nations not actually at war have declared their neutrality. It will be difficult for the officials of the nations to clearly understand the real neutrality of Jehovah’s witnesses, but their position must be so clearly stated that there may be no occasion to have any doubt as to where they stand and no doubt as to the correctness of the position they take or have taken.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ENTIRELY NEUTRAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> The true followers of Christ Jesus must follow where Christ Jesus leads, because they are called to take that exact course and they must be diligent to obey his and Jehovah's commandments. (1 Pet. 2:21) Wherever there is a conflict between the laws of the nations and the laws of Almighty God the Christian must always obey God’s law in preference to man’s law. All laws of men or nations in harmony with God’s law the Christian obeys. The words of Jesus, spoken to his disciples, apply to all persons who have made a covenant to be obedient to Almighty God. Concerning such Jesus says: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:16) That Jesus intended this rule to apply to everyone who becomes a real Christian is proved by his words, as follows: “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.” (John 17: 20) Jesus is sanctified or set aside entirely to the work of his Father, Jehovah, and concerning those who agree to follow in his steps Jesus says: “As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.”—John 17:18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> The world mentioned by Jesus consists of the nations of earth under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan. (2 Cor. 4:4; John 12:31; .John 14: 30) The world of Satan, therefore, consists of the invisible, called “heavens”, and the visible, called “earth”; and which world, in God’s due time, will be completely destroyed. (2 Pet. 3:7) Jehovah’s witnesses are set aside and commissioned by Jehovah God to be the representatives on the earth of the Most High, the Great Theocrat. Jehovah’s witnesses are not a political or religious organization, and they have no part in the political affairs of this world, not even of the nations wherein they have their domicile. The authority for this position is clearly stated by Jesus, to wit: “I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them [like aliens and strangers], because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.”—John 17:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Further addressing his true followers, the Lord Jesus says: “If ye were of the world [that is, a part of any of the nations participating in war with other nations], the world [that is, the rulers and supporters] would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you [the followers of Christ Jesus] out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.”—John 15:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">* The fact that the true followers of Christ Jesus, real Christians, are hated by the nations of earth is conclusive proof that such Christians must be neutral and not enter into any alliance with nations that are engaged at war with other nations. Some of the nations of earth, such as the United States, are now neutral toward other nations, but the United States or other neutral nations are not hated because of that neutrality. They are a part of the world and continue to have commercial dealings with the nations that are at war. The position of Jehovah’s witnesses is entirely different from that of the nations of earth. Jehovah’s witnesses are entirely neutral for Jehovah’s name’s sake, and because thereof they are hated, as Jesus stated, “for my name’s sake,” and the sake of his Father’s name. Jehovah’s witnesses are entirely for the Theocratic Government of the Almighty God by Christ Jesus the King. The uninterrupted rule of Satan has ended, and therefore great woes have come upon the nations of the earth. (Rev. 12:12) Concerning the end of Satan’s world the Lord Jesus says: “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom”; and in this connection Jesus, further speaking concerning the Christian, says: “And ye [the followers of Christ Jesus] shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24: 7-9) This alone proves that Jehovah’s witnesses are entirely separate and apart from the nations of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE THEOCRACY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Many centuries ago Jehovah, the Almighty God, declared his purpose to set up the Theocratic Government, which is his kingdom by Christ Jesus, and which kingdom shall rule the earth in righteousness. In the year 29 (A.D.) Christ Jesus was anointed and commissioned as King of the Theocratic Government or Kingdom, which he declared would be set up at his second coming. Christ Jesus was entirely neutral toward nations when he was on earth. He did not instruct his followers to take sides with any government or any nations of earth in their controversies, but he emphatically instructed all his true followers to devote themselves entirely to God’s kingdom, The Theocracy. He urged upon them the necessity of always praying for the coming and full operation of The Theocracy: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”— Matt. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> He told his followers that the nations of this world seek entirely after material or selfish things, and then to his followers he said: “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness [that is, seek The Theocracy, and not democracy, totalitarianism, Fascism, or any other political government] ; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (Matt. 6: 33) The Christian, that is to say, the true follower of Christ Jesus, who is for the government of Jehovah, could not take sides for or against any political government now on earth. Great religious organizations and the Fascists say, “We expect to rule the earth”; while the democracies say, “We will rule the earth”; and all of these are against Jehovah God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. That his followers might have no reason to take a wrongful course Jesus instructs them to give no concern to the affairs of this world, and then adds: “For all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 30-32) Here is the positive and emphatic instruction that those who will have a part in the Theocratic Government, that is, in God’s heavenly kingdom, must be entirely neutral with reference to earthly nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> Every nation on the earth, including those that are at war and those that are not now at war, endorses and practices religion, and religion and politics operate together, and not one of such nations is for the Theocratic Government of Jehovah, but all are against it. The nations of the earth pursue the selfish course for commercial and political gain. Some of these nations call themselves “Christian” nations, but they are all opposed to the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus. Every religious institution under the sun has some part in the affairs of this world, and therefore constitutes a part of this world; and that explains why the rulers of the nations of this world do not hate the religious systems, as Jesus stated his followers are hated for his name’s sake. That proves that these religious systems are not for the name of Jehovah God nor for the name of Christ Jesus, but against God and his kingdom. The instructions given to those who are for the Theocratic government are that their citizenship is in heaven and their duty is to be entirely loyal and faithful to the heavenly government by Christ Jesus. Concerning this it is written: “(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things [commercial, political and religious things].) For our citizenship is in heaven [</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.]</span><span class="font9">; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Phil. 3:18-20) Mark this strong contrast pointed out between those who are Christians and those religionists, that is, who are of this world.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> Does the Lord instruct his people to indulge in war for one nation against another nation? No; but, on the contrary, the emphatic instruction to the Christian is stated in these words: “Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this [world]; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.”—2 Tim. 2: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> One could not be a soldier of Jesus Christ and at the same time a soldier of the nation that is under the supervision of God’s enemy, the Devil. Hence the Christian does not entangle himself with the affairs of this world: “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God [the great Theocratic Government], and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ [the King of The Theocracy].” (2 Cor. 10:3-5) Then the Christian is specifically instructed as to the warfare to which he is subjected: “For ours is not a conflict with . . . flesh and blood, but with the despotisms, the empires, the forces that control and govern this dark world—the spiritual hosts of evil arrayed against us in the heavenly warfare.”—Eph. 6:12, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> The war of one nation against another nation of the earth is not the fight of the followers of Christ Jesus. If the nations of this world desire to fight, that is their affair entirely, and it is not at all the affair of one who has made a covenant to be faithful to Almighty God and his King and Kingdom. The Christian must not interfere in the least manner with the war between the nations. The Christian is not to interfere with the drafting of men of either nation that goes to war. That is the affair of the nations of this world. The Christian must be entirely neutral, and this without regard to his place of birth or nationality. It is the privilege of each Christian to make his own position and relationship to the Lord clearly to be understood, that he is separate and apart from any of the nations of this world. Jehovah’s witnesses have separated themselves entirely from this world by covenanting to be faithful to God’s kingdom, and they have received the commission from Jehovah God to aid and comfort the peoples of the earth who seek righteousness, and that without regard to what nation such people may be subject to. They bring comfort to those who are seeking the right way, by declaring to them the name and the kingdom of Almighty God by Christ Jesus, calling their attention to the emphatic word of Cod that his kingdom is the only hope for mankind. (Isa. 61:1,2; Matt. 12:18-21) To those who have covenanted to do God’s will as followers of Christ Jesus he says: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God”; that is, the Supreme One, and who gives peace and salvation to those who do his will. (Isa. 43:10,12; Ps. 3:8) Officials of the nations of this world and who have to do with the selecting of the army cannot have a proper appreciation of the scriptures hereinbefore mentioned, for the reason that they are of the world and have not devoted themselves to Almighty God. Concerning this It is written: “But the natural man [the man devoted to the things of Satan’s world] receiveth not the things of the spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.”—1 Cor. 2:14,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> The fact that worldly men and officials do not understand and appreciate the clear distinction between the nations of this world and the great Theocratic Government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus is no excuse for a Christian to yield to the demands of worldly nations. The Christian has made a covenant to be faithful to God and to his kingdom; and for the Christian to willingly break that covenant means his everlasting destruction. The position here announced of the Christian is nothing new, but was clearly set forth in the Scriptures long centuries ago for the guidance of the man of righteousness who has agreed to be faithful to Almighty God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">neutrality foreshadowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">” Jehovah used the Israelites to set up a typical theocracy, which foreshadowed his real and great Theocracy, his kingdom by Christ Jesus. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were faithful representatives of Jehovah God, and they were always neutral in the wars of other nations. Abraham had nothing to do with the fight between the rulers of Sodom and Gomorrah and their enemies. The invaders overran the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, and a great conflict raged between them. Abraham and Lot, his nephew, were there, but they took no part whatsoever in that war. (Gen. 14:1-3) After that war between the contending nations was all over and one side seized Lot and his property and fled with the same, Abraham did pursue the invaders, not because he was an ally of the defeated ones, but because one of the enemy had seized and carried away Lot, the “righteous man”. (2 Pet. 2: 7, 8) Then Abraham pursued the invaders and recovered Lot, his nephew, and not because he was his nephew, but because Lot was a faithful servant of Almighty God. Thus the divine rule is established that one of God’s devoted servants is justified in acting in behalf of his fellow servants, the servants of God. The rescue of Lot accomplished by the armed forces of Abraham was fully approved by Jehovah, as shown by the following scriptures: “And Melchiz-edek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.” —Gen. 14:18-20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> Abraham’s neutrality and the fact that he was not in any alliance with either of the warring factions are further proved by his refusal to accept any reward whatsoever or any part of the spoils taken from the enemy. (Gen. 14:21-24) This proves that Abraham was not the servant of any earthly king, but that he was the servant and representative of Jehovah God, the great THEOCRAT. Abraham’s neutrality was due to the fact that he was wholly devoted to the Theocratic Government, and therefore God addressed him as his “friend”. This is further proved by what is written concerning Abraham, to wit: “By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; for he looked for a city [government] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”—Heb. 11:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> This scripture proves that he was a stranger and did not act as a native nationalist, putting the state above Almighty God. He dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, and thus showed himself separate and apart from the others and that he was a noncombatant. He was a sheep herder, engaged in a peaceful business, and had no part in the affairs of the government in the land where he resided. lie had his mind and heart set upon God’s kingdom, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Great Theocracy ; and further it is written concerning him: “Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced [saluted] them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.”—Heb. 11: 12,13. (See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott, Rotherham’s,</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Young’s</span><span class="font9"> translation.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>20</sup> He &quot;saluted” and thus attributed salvation to Almighty God, and hence he did not salute the flag of those worldly governments and attribute salvation and protection to them. He did not look for protection or salvation from any earthly government, and therefore it is written concerning him: “For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.”—Heb. 11:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>81</sup> He could have returned to those governments whence he came by saluting their flag, and thus denying Jehovah God. And why did he not do so? The Scriptures answer: “But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly [that is, The Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus]: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.”—Vs. 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TYPICAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>82</sup> Abraham’s neutrality was typical, and furnishes the true and correct guide for the Christians, who form a part of God’s “holy nation”; and concerning which it is written: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him [Jehovah, the Great Theocrat, by faithfully representing him and his government, and not by showing forth the praises of men] who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”—1 Pet. 2: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> Further showing that the true followers of Christ Jesus are separate and distinct from the nations of this earth, the scripture continues: “Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrim* [that is, not native nationalists or any part of Satan’s world], . . . having your conversation [behavior, course of action] honest among the Gentiles [nations] ; that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works [of faithfully representing Jehovah’s theocratic government by always bearing testimony to his name and kingdom by the course of action you take], which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation [that is, the coming of distress and trouble upon the nations of the earth at Armageddon].”—1 Pet. 2:11,12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">** The only reason for any of the true followers of Christ Jesus to now be upon the earth is that they might bear witness to the name of Jehovah God and proclaim his kingdom. By remaining absolutely and entirely neutral in the controversies and wars between the nations, these Christians stand forth for the witness of the Most High and thus fulfill their commission, maintain their integrity, and prove their faithfulness to Almighty God and his King.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>28</sup> There was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> time when those who are now Jehovah’s witnesses were a part of this world, but, having made a solemn covenant to do the will of Almighty God and having become the true followers of Christ Jesus, such are no longer any part of the world. “That at that time [as citizens of the world and hence a part of earthly governments] ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world; but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”—Eph. 2:12,13,19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>20</sup> Being in Christ Jesus, one can no longer take sides in the controversies and wars between the peoples and nations, all of which nations are against Jehovah’s kingdom: “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.”—Col. 3:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>27</sup> The truly covenant people of Almighty God now on earth are not pro-“foreign power”, nor hyphenated nationalists, with a divided human allegiance; they are not propagandists for either side of the warring factions. They are separate and distinct from all such and are solely the witnesses of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government, and hence they must stand aloof from every nation of this world. They must declare the kingdom of God, and without doing so they cannot be faithful to God and receive his approval and-salvation to life. To them obedience to the world means everlasting destruction; obedience to Almighty God means everlasting life. What, then, must they do? They must be witnesses for the Lord and obey his commandments by pointing the people to his King and his Kingdom. —Matt. 24:7,14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL’S WARS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>28</sup> It has been claimed that the wars of the nation of Israel against other nations is proof that wars between nations may be properly indulged in and hence that Christians should join with other nations in making war. Such reasoning finds no support whatsoever in the Scriptures. The nation of Israel was not organized by any political ruler or dictator or usurper. That was God’s typical nation, formed and organized by the great Theocrat for the purpose of picturing the real Theocracy that shall rule the world by Christ Jesus. Israel had no man-made laws and no political parties and no religious advisers to direct the political affairs. This was true as long as that nation remained faithful to God. God chose the earthly location for his typical theocratic nation, as it is written: “A land which the Lord thy God careth for; the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.” (Deut. 11:12) “When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” (Deut. 32:8) Jehovah God, the great Theocrat, was the ruler of that typical nation Israel, and his will the only law of the nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>29</sup> The land assigned to Israel was held in possession previously by the Canaanites and others who were devoted to devil-worship, and who therefore were against Jehovah God. That land God had given to Abraham and to his seed after him. (Gen. 13:14-17; 15:18-21; Ps. 105:8-12) The Canaanites, who were against God, refused to surrender possession to God’s chosen people and refused to come over on the side of the great Theocrat, and therefore they must be ousted. The only exception was the people of Gibeon, who voluntarily put themselves on the side of Jehovah and who therefore received protection and deliverance at the hand of God’s chosen servant, Joshua. Israel’s wars against the Canaanites were carried on by the direction of Jehovah God. —Deut. 7:1; Ex. 34: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>80</sup> Joshua, whose name is the same as Jesus and who foreshadowed Christ Jesus, carried on such wars by the direct command of the Almighty God. and Joshua gained the victory for that reason.— Joshua chapters 9 and 10; Joshua 11: 20-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>31</sup> Israel was the only nation of earth to which God ever assigned any territory and authorized them to take possession of it by force. Hence the wars of Israel for gaining possession of what belonged to them by the gift of Almighty God foreshadowed Christ Jesus’ taking possession of the entire earth, a gift to him from Jehovah God, and Christ acts under the command of the Almighty. (Ps. 2:6-12) The Israelites did not invade that which belonged to others. They took the land that belonged to them by a gift from Jehovah. Their participation in war was by the command of the Almighty God, and their obedience to his commandment was more acceptable than sacrifice. (1 Sam. 15:20-23) Such wars were righteous; hence God heard and answered the prayers of his typical people as long as they obeyed him. Victory was not granted to them by reason of their superior military equipment, but because God exercised his almighty power in their behalf. (Joshua 10:14) King David carried out God’s command in taking possession of the entire domain which the great Theocrat had assigned to His typical people. (2 Samuel 8; 1 Ki. 4: 21) Thus he pictured the Greater David, Christ Jesus, taking possession of the entire earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> When the Israelites violated their covenant with God he permitted them to be punished by their enemies, and they never gained the victory over their enemies under such circumstances. But when the Israelites repented and turned to God he drove out their enemy invaders and gave Israel the victory. (Judges chapters 6 and 7) All these things happened to Israel for types and were written and recorded for the advice and guidance of faithful Christians now on the earth. (I Cor. 10: 11) None of the nations of “Christendom” ever had any territory assigned to them by the great Theocrat, Jehovah. The so-called “Christian” nations have taken possession of land by what they call “the right of discovery” or by purchase or by conquest, and not by God’s will. “Christendom” is the antitype of unfaithful Israel, which unfaithful people lost the whole land by reason of their unfaithfulness to God. “Christendom,” that is, the so-called “Christian” nations, are without any authority whatsoever from Almighty God to engage in war and with his approval and blessing. Hence the wars between the nations of the earth, even defensive wars, find no support or justification in the wars that Israel engaged in. There is nothing, therefore, that would justify the true Christian in obeying the political and religious rulers in taking up arms for aggressive war or even for defensive war of one worldly nation against another worldly nation. If the nations of “Christendom” or any other nations of earth desire to engage in war and do so, that is their affair, and it is the duty of God’s covenant people to remain entirely neutral as to such wars. Religious leaders, forming a part of this evil world, insist that Christians should engage in war between nations, citing the experiences of Israel as authority. The most powerful religious organization on earth now attempts to justify war, that is, war now raging between the nations, and hence the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority urges the religionists of the various nations to take sides and go to war. Evidently they have overlooked their own previously announced conclusions upon this point. Some conscientious member of the Hierarchy at one time wrote and published the correct position in this matter, to wit: “Here, also, it is to be noted that nations cannot draw a parallel from the Old-Testament titles. The Israelites lived under a theocracy; God, as Supreme Lord of all the earth, in specific instances, by the exercise of His supreme dominion, transferred the ownership of alien lands to the Israelites ; by His command they waged war to obtain possession of it, and their title to war was the ownership (thus given them) of the land for which they fought. The privation thus wrought upon its prior owners and actual possessors had, moreover, the character of punishment visited upon them by God's order for offences committed against Him. No state can find such title existing for itself under the natural law.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font9"> Volume 15, under the heading “War”, and subtitle IV, page 548, column 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>83</sup> Contrary to their once announced correct doctrine, the Catholic clergy in various nations now advise the “Catholic population” to participate in a war, evidently reasoning that their failure to do so would cause the Hierarchy to lose much financial support. It is therefore apparent that they are willing to repudiate their former and once correct position and sacrifice human lives in order to maintain their own present position with the parts of this wicked world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>81</sup> The Scriptures furnish no precedent or authority for a Christian to engage in war for one nation as against another, for the manifest reason that all such nations are against the great Theocratic Government and hence the fight between the nations is not the fight of one who is in a covenant to do the will of the Almighty God. The Israelites’ wars, which Jehovah approved, were for the purpose of taking possession of their own land. Outside of their own territory assigned to them by the Lord they were not authorized to extend their warfare to any more territory at any time.—See Deuteronomy 2:1-9, 19, 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>85</sup> When the holy land was invaded by other nations the Israelites were authorized to fight in a defensive war against such invaders. Specific examples are found in the Scriptures in reference to invasion by Egypt, Ethiopia, Syria and Assyria, and in which Jehovah not only approved the action of his typical people but came to their defense and fought their battles for them. (2 Ki. 18:9-37; 19:1-36; 2 Chron. 14: 9-15) When the internal enemy who was against God and his people rose up against them in war they were authorized to fight in self-defense and to subdue the anti-theocratic uprising. Such was the rule that God gave to the Israelites.—See Judges, chapters 3 to 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> In the wars that raged between the nations in the outside world beyond the boundaries of the Theocratic territory of Israel the Israelites were commanded to remain neutral, and did remain neutral as long as faithful to Jehovah. When they violated that neutrality they suffered defeat and did not have God’s help. (2 Ki. 23:29-35; 2 Chron. 35:20-24) This rule governing the typical theocracy fixes the rule by which those who are of the real Theocracy must be guided.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“CHRISTENDOM” NOT THEOCRATIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">” There is no so-called “Christian nation” of so-called “Christendom” that is a theocracy, or any part thereof, because not one of such nations even claims Almighty God as the Ruler. All these nations are ruled according to man’s law. If such nations had Jehovah God for ruler the political power could not enforce conscription laws. The law of the political governments is not theocratic. Since God commands all of his covenant people to keep themselves aloof from the world and thereby devote themselves entirely and wholly to his kingdom, no person in a covenant to do the will of God is under obligation to take up arms for one political government as against another political government. The interest of the state and the interest of God’s theocratic government are not common. The ordinances or laws of the state do not express the will of Almighty God, because God has not authorized any political nation to act for him in declaring and making war on another nation. Exactly the opposite is the Scriptural rule: “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world [of which ‘Christendom’ is a part]; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence [not from the source of ‘Christendom’].” (John 18: 36) Again says the Word of the great Theocrat: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (Ps. 33:12, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font9">Not one nation within the realm of so-called “Christendom” has Jehovah for its God and Ruler, but all such nations hate Jehovah God and his government by Christ Jesus and hate those who bear testimony to his name and his government. (Matt. 24:9) In Germany there are some Christians that are truly and fully the covenant people of God. Why should they fight for Hitler and his gangsters that defy the Almighty God and persecute those who serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesusl Some of these faithful Christians have recently been, as the press announces, executed, that is, put to death, because they would not bear arms at the command of Hitler. Thus the executed one proved his integrity and faithfulness to the great Theocratic Government and is guaranteed resurrection and life everlasting; which no gangster such as Hitler will ever get.—Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRACY</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> The Theocracy is the heavenly, invisible government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, the King, who is invisible to human eyes. (Isa. 9:6,7) That government is not allied with or represented by any religious, political, judicial government on the earth. If the church-state governments were a part of God’s Theocracy, then there would be only one government, under one Leader, Christ Jesus. Hence there could be no war between them. There would be no international division, and no rivalry, and hence no bloody conflict between the peoples of those nations. Neither would the clergy of one of such nations pray to some reputed “god” to favor one of such countries at war as against another nation at war. Christ is not divided. The Theocracy is one inseparable, righteous government, always righteous. (1 Cor. 1:10-13; 3:1-4) It follows, therefore, that Jehovah must be neutral, and hence his ear is deaf to the prayers of the clergy of all sides of the war between the nations. Jehovah God hears only the prayers of those who are for his Theocratic Government. (1 Pet. 3:12) A religious state is anti-Theocracy, and to such state God shows no favors over another like svtle or nation. Jehovah God is neutral, and his covenant people who have vowed to serve him and his Theocracy must therefore remain neutral, depending wholly and entirely upon God for protection and salvation.—2 Cor. 10: 3,4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SELF-DEFENSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>89</sup> A “pacifist” may properly be defined as one who refuses to fight under any and all circumstances. The covenant people of God are not pacifists, even as God and Christ are not pacifists. God’s covenant people are authorized to defend themselves against those who fight against the Theocratic Government. Nehemiah of Judah was in times of peace the official of the Persian government. He did not engage in building up military defenses for Persia. Because he remained neutral he was falsely accused as a sedi-tionist. (Neh. 1:11; 2:1-20) Nehemiah devoted himself to building up and strengthening the interest of Jehovah’s typical covenant people as against the anti-God forces. (Neh. 4:7-23) His opponents conspired together to fight against Jerusalem and to prevent God’s covenant people from carrying out the commandments of the Almighty. Therefore Nehemiah armed the servants of God, who worked with him, and commanded them to “fight for your brethren”.—Neh. 4:1,14.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>40</sup> Likewise Zerubbabel, who was commanded by Jehovah to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem. (Ezra 1:1-11; 2:1,2; 3:1-13) He did not devote himself to the building up of military defenses of Medo-Persia; and because he remained neutral as to the political state Zerubbabel was accused of sedition, which charge was false. (Ezra 4: G-24) But Jehovah God protected and blessed Zerubbabel in his work in behalf of the covenant people of God. (Ezra 5:1-17; G: 1-22) Thus God’s rule is fixed. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses today, in caring for the interest of The Theocracy by arranging for and holding public meetings and there proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his King, and by advertising the kingdom as commanded, have the right to defend themselves against the assaults of the anti-God, anti-Kingdom crowd who would hinder such work which God has commanded them to do; and in defending themselves they have the approval of the Almighty.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> “Doom of Religion,” September 15, 1939, page 279.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>41</sup> Being entirely neutral as between the nations of earth Jehovah’s witnesses do not pray to God for one political ruler as against another. They do not pray, as commanded by the ruler of any earthly government, for the success of the armies of one nation against another, but they pray as Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, has commanded them to pray, to wit: ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.’ (Matt. 6:10) God’s people are now living on the earth practically under all earthly governments, and it would be entirely inconsistent for them to pray for one government as against another, and particularly in view of the fact that all of such earthly governments are against God's kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses pray to their Father in heaven, who is eternal, and who is neutral as to all earthly governments, and who declares that in his own due time he will by the hand of Christ Jesus completely destroy all governments that are opposed to and against The Theocracy, for the reason that such opposing governments are under the hand of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>42</sup> Jehovah’s neutrality is further proved by the fact that he ordered his anointed King, following his resurrection, to take no action for or against any other nation on earth until due time for the Theocratic rule to begin. He commanded Christ Jesus to remain inactive toward all such nations until God sends hint forth to rule; which He did in 1914: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:1, 2; Heb. 10:12,13) At the end of the world, that is, after the time came for Satan to be ousted, God sent forth his King to rule. That did not mean that Jehovah was taking sides between the nations which rise up against each other in war (Matt. 24:7,8), nor did Jesus tell his faithful followers to take sides, but, on the contrary, he commanded them to go about amongst all the nations and preach the good news, giving testimony that Satan’s world had ended and that the kingdom of righteousness is at hand, which shall vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring blessings to the obedient people. (Matt. 24:14) The end of Satan’s world has come, and God by Christ Jesus takes a hand in completely ousting Satan and all of his supporters from the earth because the earth belongs to Christ Jesus as a gift from Jehovah God. —Ps. 2:8,9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>43</sup> The rule by which Jehovah’s covenant people must now be governed is that of strict neutrality between the nations at war. It is the privilege of all nations to fight it out amongst themselves, but the Christian must not interfere, by word or act, with the governments in any action they may take with reference to the conscription of men or material for the war. The covenant people of God must keep their hands off, because it is not their fight and it would be wrong to try to induce others not to fight. Each one must determine for himself his relationship to God and his government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>44</sup> Jehovah favors no political nation as against another like nation. In due time he expresses his wrath against all such nations, because all are against his kingdom. “Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people; let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is upon all nations,</span><span class="font9"> and his fury upon </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all their armies;</span><span class="font9"> he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.” (Isa. 34:1,2)—Jer. 25: 31, 32; Zeph. 3:8; Hag. 2: 22; Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVIDING THE PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>45</sup> Jehovah assumes no responsibility for national division, that is, for one system of government of men as against another system of government. On the contrary, Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s King, is now present, judging and separating the people of all nations into two classes, that is to say, the obedient ones in one class, designated as “sheep”, and tli&lt;‘ disobedient or opposing ones, designated as “goats&quot;. (Matt. 25: 31-46) The questions or issues upon which the individual division takes place and which all such individuals must by their course of action answer are these: Are you for the Theocratic rule by Christ Jesus the King? Do you, on the contrary, favor tiecontinuation of Satan's rule by the political and religious elements of this world? Each individual must choose for himself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>48</sup> Jehovah’s covenant people stand aloof from the nations that are anti-Theocracy, and they must remain neutral as to all such nations. There is but one nation that has Jehovah’s approval, and that is his “holy nation”, composed of Christ Jesus, the Head and Ruler, and all those who fully support and are associated with Christ Jesus. (1 Pet. 2:9) These faithful followers of Christ Jesus, in order to live, must prove their integrity and remain true and faithful to Jehovah and his King. Now the nations of earth, controlled by the religious and political rulers, conspire together to cause God’s covenant people to be cut off from being a holy nation. (Pss. 83:2-18; 2:2-6) As to all such opposing nations, they are the enemies of God and of his covenant people, and therefore the covenant people must not mix up with or become a part of any of such opposing nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>41</sup> What shall be the end of those nations that oppose the Theocracy and that persecute the faithful witnesses and their “companions”, who obey the commandments of God by preaching this “gospel of the kingdom”? Jesus answers that question as follows: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”—Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>48</sup> Even if some nations of earth have heretofore declared that they are God’s nation, it is certainly true now that every nation on earth has forgotten God and now opposes his Theocratic government. Because they oppose that kingdom and those who work under the King’s supervision, all such nations are wicked and their end is fixed. “The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.... The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">goyim]</span><span class="font9"> that forget God.” (Ps. 9:16,17) Concerning such Jehovah directs his covenant people to pray: “Arise, 0 Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">goyim;</span><span class="font9"> nations] be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, 0 Lord; that the nations may know themselves to be but men.” (Ps. 9:19, 20) “0 God, the heathen [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">goyim]</span><span class="font9"> are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.” “Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen-that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name [in spirit and in truth and without hypocrisy].” (Ps. 79:1, 6; 2 Tim. 3: 5) (Isa. 64:1, 2; Rev. 11:17,18) It would be entirely inconsistent and in disobedience to God’s commandments for any covenant child of his who supports His Theocracy to line up with and fight for one earthly nation as against another earthly nation, both of which nations are against the Theocratic Government. Therefore the position of Jehovah’s witnesses is complete neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>48</sup> Without a question of doubt every nation of earth has violated the everlasting covenant of God concerning the sanctity of life. This they have done by wrongfully killing human and beast creation, and particularly by killing those who are devoted to God, and whom they have killed because such were faithful to Jehovah God. (Gen. 9:4-6,16,17) The only justified killing of any human creature is in selfdefense or as God’s executioner. (Ex. 22:2) No nation on earth has ever claimed that it is free from the wrongful taking of the lives of others, and which has been done in disregard of God’s law. Concerning all such it is written: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.”—Isa. 24:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UNSPOTTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>80</sup> Those who are for the great Theocracy and who have therefore made a solemn covenant to do the will of Almighty God, the great Theocrat, must keep themselves unblemished and uncontaminated from the affairs of the nations of earth, which are against the great Theocrat ; as Jesus plainly declared: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.” (John 17:16,17) By the truth of Jehovah’s Word they are completely set aside to his exclusive service. Therefore such are commanded to 'keep themselves unspotted from the world’. (Jas. 1:27) “Unspotted” means to be free from blemish and from mixing up with the affairs of this world. Those who worship God in spirit and in truth must do that very thing. Such constitutes the true worship of Almighty God. There has crept into the Authorized Translation of the Bible, in James 1: 27, the word “religion”, which is improperly there. The correct translation of that text is as follows: “For the worship that is pure and holy before God the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and that one keep himself unspotted from the world.” —Jas. 1:27, Murdock’s Syriac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>01</sup> Within the realms of warring nations there doubtless are many who have devoted themselves to Jehovah God and his kingdom by Christ Jesus. Those respective nations by law conscript the manpower and send men to war against other men. That is the affair and responsibility of each of such nations, about which true neutrals have nothing to say. Public officials who have to do with conscription and the hearing of applications for exemption from military service do not understand and appreciate the relation of Jehovah’s witnesses and their “companions”, the “other sheep” of the Lord, to Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and Christ Jesus. In order to induce Christians to withdraw their application for exemption from military service the conscription officer propounds this question: “Would you defend your mother from attack?” Of course, the Christian would give the answer which the Lord Jesus gave, because such is the Scriptural answer, by which he is governed. It is not for one person to decide for another what answer should be given, but the Lord himself fixes the matter. Each person must decide for himself his own relationship to God and Christ. Christ’s definition of who is the mother or brother of one of the covenant people of Jehovah God furnishes the true and correct guide for all Christians. Jesus was instructing the people, and concerning those who would love him and his kingdom he said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” — Matt. 12:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>M</sup> Necessarily one who is against the King is not for him, and one who is for the King cannot be against him. (Mark 9:40) The two texts above referred to are in exact harmony. Stated in common phrase, the position of every person is either for the King and his kingdom or against the King and his kingdom. There is no middle ground. At that point of his discourse to the people the following took place and these words were uttered by Cinist Jesus: “While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren I For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.”—Matt. 12: 46-50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">•<sup>8</sup> Further, Jesus clearly defined the relationship of those who do the will of Jehovah God: that all who sincerely do the will of God by obeying his commandments occupy the relationship to each other as brother, sister, and mother, that is, the family relationship of the family of God. The fact that one has a brother and sister and mother after the flesh but who are against the Theocracy by Christ Jesus does not at all mean that the Christian is under any obligation whatsoever to care for or protect such opponent of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptural answer to the propounded question, therefore, is this: If the one who is called “my mother” is against the kingdom of Jehovah by Christ Jesus, then the only duty I have towards such is to tell her of God’s provision for mankind. If she is really devoted to God and his kingdom, then as my real relative in Christ Jesus I will do whatsoever I can for her protection and defense; but that does not mean that I must fight against the nation or people that is fighting another nation, both of which are against God and his kingdom. As to such nations I am entirely neutral and cannot and will not fight for one as against the other. If an enemy of the great Theocracy and His King attempts to do me harm and to hinder me and my work for the kingdom and fights against me and my spiritual mother or brother, then I have the right to defend myself against such assaults, and the right to defend my brethren, and I will do so.—Neh. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">” Thus the Christian clearly defines himself as for peace and righteousness but not as a pacifist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIAN’S POSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The position of the true follower of Christ Jesus is clearly set forth in the Scriptures. Such follower of Christ Jesus cannot compromise. One is either for The Theocracy or against that righteous government. If for the Theocratic Government and His King, then he is not going to compromise in order to escape hatred or punishment at the hands of enemies. He is now in a position to prove his integrity toward God and to prove that the Devil’s challenge to Jehovah is a wicked lie. (Job 2: 5) Therefore as a follower of Christ Jesus he can be faithful and true to God, and will do so, come what may.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>67</sup> Jehovah the great Theocrat has now enthroned his King and sent him forth to rule. (Pss. 2:6; 110:2; Rev. 11:17) Christ Jesus is now at the temple of Jehovah conducting his judgment of the nations. God’s “strange work” of exposing the fallacy and the hypocrisy of religion, and pointing- the people to the fact that The Theocracy is the only hope for the peoples, is now in progress, and that work will be finished in his due time. (Isa. 28:21; Matt. 12:18-21) The Lord’s “other sheep”, the “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9-17), are now hastening to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his King. The “strange work”, when completed, will be quickly followed by God’s act, “his strange act,” at the battle of the great day of God Almighty called “Armageddon”, and at which battle all the opponents of The Theocracy will die. Only those who have declared themselves for The Theocracy and who maintain their integrity shall live. Some of them may be killed by the enemy because of their faithfulness, but such have the promise of resurrection to life. Therefore all who receive protection and salvation from Jehovah must prove their integrity to the great Theocrat and to his King. No one who is devoted to the Theocratic Government and its King will fear what man can do to him. He will fear God and obey him. (Isa. 8:13,14) Let all the faithful ones keep in mind the words of Christ Jesus spoken to them: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10:28) “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) It is far better to die faithful to God and because of faithfulness and receive at the hands of the Lord everlasting life than to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization and suffer everlasting destruction. Concerning the faithful it is written that those who now die faithful shall have an instantaneous resurrection from d</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eath</span><span class="font9">, (1 Cor. 15:51,52) Jehovah God is the fountain of life, the everlasting Father, and the Giver of life to those who obey him, which gift he makes through Christ Jesus, his beloved Son. (John 3:16; Rom. 6:23) “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah,” and not to man nor to any organization of men. (Ps. 3:8) There is no room for compromise with the enemy. Remember that God has said to his people concerning the enemy: “And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” —Jer. 1:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>68</sup> Those who have taken their stand on the side of the great THEOCRAT and his King will stand fast in that position, trusting in and relying solely upon God, well knowing that God will deliver them and grant unto them everlasting life. All who are on the Lord’s side will be neutral as to warring nations, and will be entirely and wholly for the great THEOCRAT and his King.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RELIGIOUS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH made Jerusalem to be “beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth”. (Ps. 48:2) For his own purpose he selected it when, in ancient time, this naturally favored spot of earth was held and used by a people that neither acknowledged nor obeyed him. He translated the control of the place from the polluted Canaanites and delivered it from the power of darkness into the kingdom of one with whom his everlasting covenant was made. The Most High God “chose the tribe of Jtdah, the mount Zion, which he loved”. There “he built his sanctuary like high palaces”. (Ps. 78:68,69) “For [Jehovah] hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.”—Ps. 132: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the time of Jehovah’s selecting this place for his exclusive use, strict justice could only consign it to destruction, but the mercy and loving-kindness of God exercised for and in her behalf permitted the city to stand. Of this act on his part Jehovah said: “Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, . . . and thou becamest mine.” (Ezek. 16:8) It was a time to exercise love and mercy over it, and Jehovah did so, and it became Jehovah’s. lie covered its unsightliness by taking it from beneath the control of the first “covering cherub”, now the Devil, and placing it under the rulership of David his beloved King, that the name of the Almighty God might be there. “But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.” (2 Chron. 6: 6) “I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David.” (Ps. 89: 3, 28, 34, 35) When Jehovah put David his king at Jerusalem he cleansed the city of its pollutions by the washing of the water of his Word, and by his kingly administration. “Then</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark19"></a>HARLOTRY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">washed I thee with water: yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.” (Ezek. 16:9) The anointing here mentioned is, in Hebrew, not the word denoting official designation, but is rather the anointing Ezekiel describes as done for a newly born and abandoned baby girl, cleansed, refreshed and made sweet. It symbolizes that God planted the city and put his name there, and that the royal city of his anointed was there. It was made ‘the city of the great King”. — Ps. 48:2; Matt. 5:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ezekiel’s further figurative description appears in these words: “I [Jehovah] clothed thee, . . . and shod thee, . . . and I girded thee, . . . and I covered thee. ... I decked thee . . . and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen: . . . thou didst eat, . . . and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.” (Ezek. 16:10-13) The psalmist says of Jerusalem that it was the “perfection of beauty”. (Ps. 50:2) Jehovah God blessed and enriched the city by his kings, David and Solomon; he made it to prosper into the grandest kingdom the world has thus far ever had. What contributed chiefly to its beauty was that it had the ark of God’s testament placed there on Mount Zion, and that later God caused Solomon to build the glorious temple within the city and on Mount Moriah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fame of Jerusalem spread throughout the earth. Even the queen of Sheba, hearing of the fame of Jerusalem and its king, came from the uttermost parts of the earth, and, beholding its glory, exclaimed: “The half was not told me.” In harmony with this Ezekiel prophesied: “And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 16:14) God made the city famous: “And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.” (1 Ki. 10:24) “And [Jehovah] magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.” (1 Chron. 29:25) Jehovah’s name made Jerusalem famous. At the dedication of its temple Solomon’s prayer was in fact a prophecy when he said: “Moreover, concerning a stranger that is not of thy people Israel, but comcth out of a far country for thy name’s sake: (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house.” (1 Ki. 8:41,42) It was God’s city, symbolical of his organization on earth. Out of this glorious eity and its people, the Israelites, so wonderfully favored of Jehovah, only a small remnant remained true and faithful unto God.—Isa. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let it now be noted how God has duplicated all of this in the spiritual manner toward his true organization, his chosen “people for his name”. To earth he sent his beloved Son, whom David foreshadowed and who with his own blood purchased the right of men to live. It was Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King, that brought life and immortality to light. (2 Tim. 1:10) With Christ Jesus and his faithful apostles whom God gave to him Jehovah laid the foundation of his glorious new organization, and at Pentecost the way was opened for others to enter and the selection of the members of the kingdom began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All these were originally “dead in trespasses and sins”, all “children of wrath [and polluted], even as others”, a people “which had not obtained mercy”, symbolized by the accursed Canaanites. Upon the intercession and mediation of Christ Jesus those who came seeking the way to life Jehovah justified. He brought them into the eovenant by sacrifice, and made them his children by begetting and adoption; and he cleaned them up ‘by the washing of the water of his Word’. (Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5) Then he called such into his kingdom and clothed them with the insignia of service in his organization. He fed them upon “food convenient” for them, beautified their hands and feet, and made them “stewards of the mysteries of God” and “ambassadors for Christ”; and he anointed them and brought them into the covenant for the kingdom. Thus Jehovah did for those who were faithfully devoted to him ; and thus he shows forth the rule that must govern all who start to follow in the footsteps of Christ, and who shall thereafter be approved by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning Jesus’ faithful followers Paul the apostle wrote: “For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Aehaia, but also in every place you)<sup>1</sup> faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.” (1 Thess. 1:8) In those days the fame of the little band of faithful followers of Christ Jesus was spread throughout the land: “Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.” (Rom. 1:8) These faithful ones learned and boldly performed instructions Jesus had given them from his Father. God’s purpose is that his chosen people shall be witnesses to all creation, concerning his own supremacy, his glorious name and the majesty of his King and kingdom: “The gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven.’’ (Col. 1:23, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">li.V.)</span><span class="font7"> “For we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.” (1 Cor. 4:9) Heathen religionists, their beliefs and their practices, have been at all times and are now of the Devil, and an abomination in the sight of God. True and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are a sweet savor unto Jehovah: “For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; to the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?”—2 Cor. 2:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus instructed his apostles to let their light shine, and says to his faithful followers: “That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life.” (Phil. 2:15,16) “Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.” (1 Pet. 2:12) Such are “a peculiar people”, chosen for Jehovah’s name’s sake, “zealous of good works.” (1 Pct. 2:9; Acts 15:14; Titus 2: 14) That which makes the earthly members of God’s organization beautiful and a spectacle for men and angels is the ‘Word of life and truth held forth’ by them. The laying of the foundation of Jehovah’s capital city or organization in the days of Jesus’ service on earth marks the beginning of the greatest favor that ever came to creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what is the net result as of today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Out of all those who have been favored with some knowledge of God’s truth, and who have been brought into the covenant by sacrifice, today there appears but a small remnant that is true and faithful to Jehovah God and to his Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All that came to pass upon the Israelites foreshadowed what has come to pass and is to come to pass upon “Christendom”. One is a parallel of the other. The reason for the falling away of the Israelites, and the reason that there has been a great falling away of “organized Christianity”, and the reason for the destructive calamity that is about to come upon her, God caused Ezekiel to foretell and state in these words: “But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was.”—Ezek. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The physical facts completely prove the fulfillment of this prophecy. The clergy and the “elective elders” and the principal of the flock, because of pride, have exalted themselves and boasted of their own glory, and have neglected to look to and honor God, from whom all things good proceed. When mention is made of the clergy, no individual is singled out, but reference is made to those who assume to be preachers in the church and who glorify themselves and not Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus. As to those who seek the favor of men, and who give honor and glory to men, such are mentioned as a class. Pride and extreme ingratitude mark all such. All of God’s favors bestowed upon “Christendom” are ignored and forgotten. “And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou want naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.” (Ezek. 16:22) Thus it was with natural Israel, and so it is and has been with so-called “organized Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul, addressing the boasters and comparing them with the faithful, wrote: “For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.” (1 Cor. 4:7,10) What is said about the clergy applies to all who profess to be on the side of God and Christ, whether mature or immature ones, who take a similar or like course, who cause strife and division, and who prostitute the truth and gain popularity with the world. Of and concerning such it is written: “From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.” (Jas. 4:1-4, 8) The clergy of “Christendom” have prostituted and commercialized the Word of God in order that they might satisfy their own selfish desires. They have prostituted “Christianity” with the political powers in order to gain popularity and favor among men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That which marks the true followers of Jesus Christ as the people of God is symbolized by their “garments”. Claiming to be Christ’s, “organized Christianity” and all its representatives have used their garments, or means of identification, to adorn the polluted places of Satan’s organization, and this they have done in order to draw to them the support of worldly organizations. “And of thy garments thou didst take, and dcckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon; the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.” (Ezek. 16:16) The ‘fair jewels of gold and silver’, picturing the truth which God gave to the followers of Christ, have been polluted and employed in the worship of images of men, and used as a means to commit spiritual fornication with Satan’s organization. “Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them.” (Ezek. 16:17) The clergy and the unfaithful elders have perverted the service of Almighty God by substituting their own ceremonies, or ostentation of “character development”, or the worship of men as leaders in “Christendom” by setting up religious images to be worshiped, thereby intending to draw others after them; and thus they have committed whoredom, in the language of the scripture. The food which Jehovah has graciously provided for spiritual Israel, to wit. his Word, and the refreshing “oil” and “incense”, symbolizing their refreshment and sweet savor that comes from proper use of his Word, have been polluted by being mixed with devilish doctrines and satanic worship.—Ezek. 16:18,19.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark21"></a>LETTERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH A GOD OF ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, Jehovah’s witnesses of Switzerland assembled with our companions at Zurich, September 3, 1939, at convention, herewith declare solemnly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our hearts are filled with joy in the realization of the fact that we, by Jehovah the Highest, who is a God of order, and by his Son Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd, have been brought into a condition of complete and unshakable unity, whereby alone it was possible, and will be so in the future, as it pleases Him, to give to the nations of earth the witness as commanded by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this firm conviction we declare that the institution organized by Jehovah for the proclamation of the coming just rule on earth is Jehovah's visible Theocratic Government. Moreover, that Jehovah and Jesus Christ are the “higher powers” to whom the anointed and their companions on earth must render unconditional obedience and absolute confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We further declare that even though persons in God’s great organization are not of importance, we recognize that the Lord has placed special responsibility upon Brother Rutherford as the president of The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and that the Lord has given to him a special measure of his spirit whereby he has been enabled to serve the people of the Lord, that is, his brethren, in an unselfish manner, and has so been able to help them to fulfill their covenant obligations to the Highest faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, who are thus blessed by the Lord, anointed and Jonadabs, declare on this day, because of a burning desire to do so, that we will faithfully support our dear Brother Rutherford and also Brother Harbeek who, thirteen years ago, under direction of the Lord’s spirit, was appointed by Brother Rutherford as the servant of the Central European office in Berne, and thus help to push the work of proclamation with all our might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, we declare that we will sever any connection with such as do not possess with us this spirit of loyalty and unity and who refuse to form a closely united front against the enemy Satan and his allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whoever can support with his whole heart what was read, may now manifest it by rising from his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brothel<sup>-</sup> Harbeek is charged to communicate this resolution to Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Realizing that this is a time of great peril and of great shaking and that subtle dangers beset the people of Jehovah as the Devil attempts to destroy the morale of the Lord’s people, to safeguard the kingdom interests committed to its care the Milwaukee [Wis.] company of Jehovah’s witnesses desires to go on record as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are first, last and all the time for Jehovah’s Theocracy. We wish to once more reiterate our full faith and confidence in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> as the channel of Jehovah’s truth and in you as the one to whom the Lord has intrusted the responsibility of the kingdom interests therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This resolution was passed by the Milwaukee company at its regular meeting in Kingdom Hall, Sunday, October 1, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May Jehovah bless you as you seek by all means within your power to press the battle to the gate. We are with you and by the Lord's grace will permit nothing to disrupt or retard the Lord’s work in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NEXT: ORGANIZE THEM FOR STUDY, SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The woman accepted a Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font7"> Being short on funds she requested me to come back on some later date to receive the contribution. Taking an afternoon off from my regular seeular work (I am a farmer) I decided to journey over and make this call so long pending. Approximately an hour’s drive found me at my destination. I found the lady home. She was pleased to see me and was only too glad to contribute for the literature placed. I gave a short witness, my phonograph being loaned to an interested person. She appeared more interested; told me to go next door, that her sister lived there, that she wanted to see me. I went next door; found her sister in. She asked me various questions. She saw the books her sister had, was interested, and wanted a set like them. I placed with her a Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> Then she informed me of a friend of hers also interested. She too wanted to see me. I took the address and went immediately. I found her in. She saw the books and wanted a set. I placed a Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> Her married daughter came in, saw me, and saw the books her mother just got. She wanted a set. I placed a Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> Both asked me a lot of questions, appeared deeply interested, said they had been waiting for me to come around. Daughter said: ‘I have a friend that wants to see you. She’s interested in this. Could you go and see her?’ Did I! After a short verbal testimony I made straightway to the person mentioned. I found her in. She wanted a set. I placed a Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> She asked me many questions, was deeply interested, and wanted to know much about this work. All this took place within twenty minutes’ time: 4 Bibles, 4 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font7"> among four people, not including the first lady, of course. All contributed cash!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PHOTOGRAPHIC TESTIMONY UPHELD INF. MARCHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They were given traffic tickets, and it came up before the court last Thursday. There were 24 publishers who were given tickets. The police officer put in his story, and, as in most cases, the truth was not told. He informed the court that the marchers were about two feet apart and were causing a commotion, blocking the sidewalks, and told other untruths. The officer was allowed to complete his story. When he was finished, the enclosed pictures were handed to the judge. The judge looked at the pictures and could not see anything wrong and certainly not like what the officer described, and he turned to the officer and asked him what he was trying to do. By this time the officer’s face was getting redder all the time. Then all cases were dismissed and the judge told the officer he could not do this again. These pictures really settled the case, and it seems a good plan to have someone follow along with a camera who is not visibly identified with the marchers. In this way valuable information can be obtained and the pictures come in handy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LOST NO TIME WHILE PARKING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A publisher recently, while accompanying her husband on a business trip to York, Pa., was sitting in their parked car on a downtown street. Deciding to make good use of the time she took up a number of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font7"> booklets, got out of the car, and spoke to passers-by concerning the booklet. In a few minutes she had placed twenty-three booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOKMARK EFFECTIVE IN NEW YORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Shortly after </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> was released and the new bookmark put into use a publisher called at a gas station. After she told the attendant of the purpose of her call, he flatly turned it down. Turning, she noticed a man near-by doing nothing, and not connected with the station. She approached him and told him about the message in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> and the importance of studying it. He listened carefully and then said: ‘That sounds good to me. I think I would like to read that book.’ Upon reaching into his pocket he found he had only 20c. He then persuaded the gas station attendant to lend him 5c to make the 25c contribution for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font7">with which was left the bookmark. Several days later, with the aid of the bookmark, the man called at the Mount Vernon unit’s headquarters and stated he was not quite through reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> but wanted three more, because he found it to be very interesting and that he was giving these to his friends. One week later he called again, obtained four more to distribute among his friends. A bookmark was given with each </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> Another publisher left a bookmark with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> when placing it. Two weeks later a family of three, father, mother, and young daughter, attended the Sunday night meetings, the lecture series and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, and stated after meeting that they have been reading Watchtower publications for some time and knew it was about time they did something else besides reading, but they never could locate any of the meetings. With the aid of the bookmark bearing the address and time of meetings they were able to get in touch with the nearest meeting. At our Sunday night 6:30 meeting, during the recorded lecture a person of good will was seen coming in with the bookmark in her hand, evidently referring to it in finding the unit headquarters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">60-HOUR QUOTA EFFORTS IN LONDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Looking through the publishers’ record cards it is grand to see the efforts being made by the faithful to reach the quota of 60 hours a month. Four have passed their quota and reached 78, 72, 71 and 62; while 47 is the average of others. One Jonadab reports 65 hours for his first six weeks’ work. As an illustration of how Jehovah has provided all the necessary equipment that the great multitude may share in his strange work, I cite the instance of my little girl aged 5, who has joined with us in the service whenever possible and has become proficient in using the testimony card. In July she worked 22 J hours and placed 78 booklets, besides </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font7"> and 6 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 516 since. Since August 1 she has been permitted to carry the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> book as well, and yesterday in 4 hours placed 2 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> books, 10 booklets and a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Last week she asked me for a midget phonograph.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW PIONEER GOT SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“During the last three weeks it has been my privilege to receive seventeen subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font7"> This was accomplished by continually presenting before the public the contents of said magazines and the necessity of their obtaining these magazines. First, however, I endeavor to play the series ‘Face the Facts’, or ‘Fascism or Freedom’, showing them the dangerous condition existing, thus arousing the interest. Interesting them, I present the magazines. With remarkable results seen.”</span></p>

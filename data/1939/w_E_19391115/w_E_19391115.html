<p><span class="font6">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos Is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark16"></a>SNARES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thorns and snares are in the way of the frotoard; he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.&quot; —Prov. 22:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TEHOVAH duly warned his typical covenant peo-I pie concerning the snares that endangered their </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8"> lives. In the face of such warning the typical people fell into snares, and the nation was destroyed. Jehovah’s words of warning were recorded for the specific benefit of those upon whom the ends of the world are now come, meaning the end of Satan’s world and the beginning part of the world of righteousness. (1 Cor. 10:11) Such warnings were “written for our learning” (Rom. 15:4) and for the protection of the people of God, who are today in a covenant with him, to the end that they may give heed to such warnings. “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise.” (Eph. 5:15) To “walk circumspectly” means to look carefully round about and to see to it that one is moving in harmony with the way the Scriptures point out and is doing at all times that which is strictly in harmony with and in the interest of the Theocracy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A snare is a noose, a net, a hook, or a trap, into which the creature is liable to fall, and especially in danger, when he is not watchful and diligent in doing the will of God. Snares are laid by Satan, the wicked one. In placing snares the Devil uses the wicked spirits and wicked men, all of whom are mortal enemies of the covenant people of God: “The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet I erred not from thy precepts.” (Ps. 119:110) “The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.”— Ps. 140:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">* The chief work of the wicked one, the Devil, is to destroy creatures who have made a covenant to do the will of God. This the Devil does in his endeavor to carry out his challenge to Jehovah that he, Satan, could turn all men away from God. (Job 2: 5) There are many snares or nets laid now by the Devil in his endeavor to entrap the covenant people of God, that is, both the remnant and the Jonathan class, which will form the “great multitude”. To enable God’s people to detect and to avoid such snares </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> calls the attention of the covenant people of God, and of all who desire righteousness, to the scriptures which give warning of such snares, and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">also to the scriptures which point to the way of the only means of escaping such snares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> A snare that stands at the head of the list of those prepared and set by Satan the Devil is religion. Any form of worship that gives adoration, praise or reverential recognition to any object, creature or thing or image is properly designated as religion; and religion is a snare. For this reason Jehovah commanded his covenant people: “Thou shalt have no other gods before [above, besides, in the place or stead of] me.” (Ex. 20; 3) Jehovah God is the source of life, and salvation belongs to him alone. (Ps. 36:9; Ps. 3:8) He grants salvation only to those who obey him. A creature that claims to serve God and who at the same time gives reverential honor, worship or praise to any creature or thing in connection with such worship, is practicing religion. Jehovah God commands all to worship Christ Jesus because Christ Jesus is the express image of his Father, Jehovah, and because he is the Executive Officer of Jehovah always carrying out Jehovah’s purpose. (Heb. 1:3-6) But any creature performing a ceremony of adoration or worship, in which reverential honor, praise, or worship is given to a man, to woman or any image or thing, is hereby ignoring God’s commandment and is practicing religion in direct violation of the command of the Most High. The setting up and use of images of anything, claiming the same to be a part of the worship of God, is wrong because in violation of God’s commandment: “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.” —Ex. 20: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Knowing this, the Devil shortly after the flood set forward Nimrod as one before, above and in the place and stead of Jehovah God to be worshiped by the people. Nimrod was a mighty hunter and slayer of </span><span class="font4">330 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">animals and men and always did so in violation of God’s everlasting covenant. In worshiping Nimrod the people entirely forgot the Creator, Jehovah God. Nimrod was the beginning of organized religion. The people were induced to worship Nimrod while he lived and also after his death. He was made a “god” or mighty one, whom the Devil induced the people to worship. (Gen. 10:8-10) The Devil ensnared the people of many nations by leading them to worship the various wicked spirits called “gods” or mighty ones. Religion was thus used as a trap to ensnare the people of all nations. Long thereafter God chose Israel, the descendants of “his friend” Abraham, as his people and made a covenant with them and led them out of Egypt and started them on their way to the promised land. Thereafter he used that people to make pictures foreshadowing things that would come to pass in the end of the world. To safeguard the Israelites from the Devil religion, and to thus enable them to escape the snares of religion, God gave the Israelites specific commandment concerning religion or the worship of gods, spirits, or human mighty ones. Note the specific commandment of Jehovah warning the people against such snares: “Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.” “They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a snare unto thee.&quot;—</span><span class="font8">Ex. 23: 24, 25, 33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The people that inhabited Canaan and the countries round about practiced the Devil religion. These included the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites and the Jebusites. In making a covenant with the people of Israel and giving them warning against religion, God said to them: “Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord; for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. Observe thou that which I command thee this day; behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">lest it be for a snare in the midst</span><span class="font8"> of thee: but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: for thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice.” (Ex. 34:10-15) God thus gave his law to his people to safeguard them from religion, the snare of the Devil, in order that they might be as a people ready to receive Christ when he came.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>T</sup> Shortly before reaching the promised land Jehovah caused Moses to deliver to the Israelites His commandment concerning their proper conduct, and in this He specifically pointed out religion as a snare of the wicked one into which the Israelites were liable to fall and which they must be diligent to shun: “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">will be a snare unto thee.</span><span class="font8"> If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? Thou shalt not be afraid of them; but shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not desire</span><span class="font8"> the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.”— </span><span class="font8">Deut. 7:16-18, 25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Here God warns specifically against the snare of religion and also against the snare of fear: “Take heed to thyself, that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to the Lord, which he hateth. have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. What thing soever I command you, observe to do it; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.”—Deut. 12:30-32.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Joshua succeeded to the place occupied by Moses. Both Moses and Joshua were types of Christ Jesus, and their words delivered to natural Israel applied specifically as commandments given by Jehovah through Christ Jesus to those now on earth who are in a covenant to do the will of God. They both spoke God’s commandments to the people, warning them against the snare of religion. Joshua delivered to the people God’s commandment: “Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your God.” “Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">but they shall be snares and traps unto you,</span><span class="font8"> and scourges in your sides, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">and thorns in your eyes,</span><span class="font8"> until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.” “When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.” (Josh. 23:11,13,16) By his angel God delivered this further message to the people of Israel: “And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars; but ye have not obeyed my voice; why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their gods shall be a snare unto you.&quot;—</span><span class="font8">Judg. 2:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> At the prosent time and for some time past men have been made mighty ones in the eyes of the people. These include the pope, the cardinals, and bishops and others of the Hierarchy; and images are used in connection with their worship, and while the people are induced to believe they are worshiping God they give honor and praise and adoration to creatures, in direct violation of God’s law, and thus they practice religion, which originated with the Devil and which constitutes a snare into which many people are caught.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Although duly warned of the snares which the Devil had laid for them, the Israelites forsook their covenant and practiced religion, recognizing and bowing down to the wicked spirits: “And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger. And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.” “And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">whoring after other gods,</span><span class="font8"> and bowed themselves unto them; they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.” (Judg. 2:12-15,17) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them.</span><span class="font8"> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils.”-Ps. 106:36,37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> When the Lord Jesus came to the earth and went about preaching the truth to the people he found that religion had been adopted and was being practiced by that people in the place and stead of the true worship of Almighty God. The Pharisees or other teachers who led in the practice of religion made the claim that they were serving God, even as the Papacy makes that claim today, but Jesus told them that they drew near to God with their mouths only, but their heart devotion was not to Him and therefore they were serving the Devil and had become the children of the Devil.—Matt. 15:1-9; John 8:42-44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee and a practitioner of religion, which religion originated with Satan and was supported by the traditions of men and taught by them, yet the claim was made that such was the worship of Almighty God. (Gal. 1:10-14) The Lord revealed to Saul the truth concerning himself and opened Saul’s understanding, and he immediately thereafter abandoned religion and worshiped God in spirit and in truth. Thereafter he was known as Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, and henceforth served God and Christ, proving his faithfulness and devotion to the Lord to the end. (Acts 9:1-20; 26:1-21; 2 Tim. 4: 6-8) Saul was a zealous Pharisee and persecutor of Christians and was caught in the religious snare of the Devil. Because of his honesty of heart the Lord delivered him from that snare of religion and made him the true servant of Christ Jesus. The foregoing scriptures prove beyond any question of doubt that religion is a snare of the Devil; and when religion is practiced in the name of God and Christ it is even a greater means of deception and is an abomination in the sight of God because it is fraudulent and hypocritical and subtly turns the people away from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> Let it be assumed that the Papal church system was organized originally by sincere men. Early in the existence thereof the teaching of men was substituted for the true worship of Almighty God. From then till now images have been employed in connection with the religious practices of the Papal system. In that church system men are honored and praised, and to such men others bow down. Images are used and prayers are made to creatures, contrary to God’s Word. Great reverence and devotion are shown to creatures. The Papal religion is clearly and openly a violation of God’s law. It is proved to be one of the most subtle snares of the Devil. Millions of sincere persons have been caught in that snare, and the result is that millions of persons ignorantly worship creatures and images, in defiance of God’s law. Religion has become a political organization, carried on in the name of God, and by religion the men who practice it are enabled to carry on the worst racket known amongst men. It is not at all necessary to find that all who are practicing religion are dishonest. On the contrary, many sincere persons have been caught in the snare of religion, even as Paul was ensnared. Many are the victims of the religious racket, and these are repeatedly robbed of their material substance by the false claims of religious leaders who take their money upon tbe pretext that they are getting for the people favors with God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1S</sup> In the present day God has revealed to the honest seeker after truth that religion is a snare of the Devil, and one who has received such knowledge from the Lord has laid upon him the obligation to tell others about that snare in order to aid others in gaining a knowledge of the truth, that they may flee from religion and fmd the true way to life. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses and their “companions” proclaim to the people the Word of God, that “religion is a snare and a racket”. This is done not for the purpose of holding up creatures to ridicule, but for the purpose of aiding honest and sincere persons to escape from these snares of the Devil and to learn what it means to worship God in spirit and in truth, and to find the way to life. The sounding of the message of truth today is a warning to the people, and such warning should be sounded with firmness and yet with kindness, because God has commanded such warning to be given. The purpose is not to offend anyone, but to aid sincere persons to see the danger into which they have fallen and the only means of escape. It is now fatal to be caught in and remain in the religious snare. At the same time there are other snares laid by the Devil and which are closely allied to religion, and into those snares many are caught and held and which lead to their destruction. Attention is here called to some of these snares.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> It is written in the Word of God: “The fear of man bringeth a snare.” (Prov. 29:25) This text, of course, means that to have a dread or fear of men leads into a snare; but the fear that men may do one an injury is not the only fear included in this text. The word “fear” has a much broader meaning than merely to anticipate that you are about to receive some physical injury. The word here used means “to tremble”, means “inciting reverential adoration toward others”; hence it is seen that fear is not limited to anticipated bodily injury. It also means the fear that one may not have the approval of men or receive the plaudits of men. One who is anxious to receive the approval of men is therefore the victim of fear. To dread to be disapproved by men even for doing one’s duty is fear that leads into the Devil’s snare. If one is commanded or commissioned by the Almighty God to do and perforin a certain thing, and then fails or refuses to carry out that commission because of fear that the performance thereof would call down upon himself the disapproval of others, then he is thereby led into the snare of the Devil. Often one is heard to say: “If I go into the witness service, going from house to house and speaking the gospel message, what will the people think of me?” It is the fear of men that leads one to such conclusion, that is, fear that human creatures will not think well of the one who goes into God’s service. God commands his covenant people to sound the doom of religion and the warning to the people of the means of escape. One who has made a covenant to do the will of God, and who then refrains from sounding the message of Jehovah against religion because he fears to receive the reproach of others for so doing, is thereby led into Satan’s snare. One who refuses to tell the truth of God’s Word by announcing that religion is a snare and a racket thereby refuses to speak the truth of and concerning the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as set forth in the Scriptures. Or if he refuses to speak the truth concerning other religious practices, or if he puts on the soft pedal concerning religion and does so because of a desire to escape adverse criticism of men, such person is the victim of fear and is thereby caught in the snare of the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>17</sup> The great issue is God’s kingdom, the Theocracy by Christ Jesus, against Satan’s organization. All of God’s covenant people are commanded to proclaim the kingdom message as his witnesses, and anyone of such covenant people who fails or refuses to proclaim that message against Satan’s organization and in favor of the Theocracy as commanded, and so fails or refuses because of fear of receiving adverse criticism of men, is thereby led straightway into the Devil’s snare. The professed Christian who desires and seeks approval of men cannot be faithful to Jehovah and to his King. The man who desires to be highly thought of amongst men, and refrains from bold service to the Lord for that reason, is ensnared by the Devil. When Paul received the truth and became the apostle of Jesus Christ he no longer sought the approval of men, but proclaimed the kingdom gospel in spite of all criticism and persecution that were heaped upon him. As the apostle of the Lord Paul wrote: “Do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.” (Gal. 1:10) It was because of his boldness and faithfulness in preaching the gospel concerning Jehovah and his King and Kingdom that he not only was reproached but suffered all manner of cruel persecution at the hands of men. In this he rejoiced, because, as he pointed out, such was necessary to prove faithfulness under persecution in order to have a part with Christ Jesus in his kingdom.—Col. 1: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> The man who claims to have consecrated himself to God and who then seeks to be what is generally called “a good fellow” amongst others, and craves the favor of men, proves himself thereby to be a </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">November 15, 1939 man-pleaser, which is an abomination in the sight of God. (Eph. 6:6; Col. 3: 22) If a man claims to be consecrated to God and is a lawyer and appears in court as counsel for another consecrated person, and then conducts himself and the case on trial in such a manner that he might receive the approval of other men in the court, such lawyer is a man-pleaser and proves his unfaithfulness to God and to the kingdom. The treatment of one of God’s children is the treatment of the Lord Jesus Christ, as Jesus himself declares: “Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.” (Matt. 25:45) One who fails or refuses to look well to and defend the interest of a Christian, and does so in order that he might appear as a good fellow in the eyes of other men, is therefore the enemy of Christ. What God requires of his servants is to be wholly devoted to him and his kingdom. There can be no proper course of compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. To receive the Lord’s approval one must be wholly and entirely for the Lord. Fear of receiving the disapproval of men is due to self-pride, which is also fear, and which leads into Satan’s snare and ends in destruction. “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. Better it is to be of an humble [obedient] spirit with the lowly [the followers of Christ], than to divide the spoil [honor] with the proud.”—Prov. 16: 18, 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>19</sup> Those who practice religion seek the approval of others and thus attempt to make others believe that they are exceedingly of good character, and this they do because of fear, that is to say, fear that others may not think so well of them. In this they fail to be obedient to God’s commandment and are led into a snare. Because of his imperfection no one can develop himself to perfection that God would approve him, but he can keep his heart perfect and his devotion wholly to God, and such is required in order to receive God’s approval.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> Reverence exhibited toward men, such as that shown toward the pope and other officials of the Hierarchy, is induced by fear and leads into the Devil’s snare. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">heiling</span><span class="font8"> or hailing of men and praising men is induced by fear of man, is an abomination in the sight of God, and leads into the snare of the Devil and ends in destruction of such fearful ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FROWARD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>21</sup> Within the meaning of the Scriptures, the word “froward” means “being perverse”, and therefore means that one is disobedient to God’s appointed way, not willing to obey instructions from the Lord, but is one who seeks the approval of men and becomes a murmurer and complainer against God’s organization. The indisputable facts have shown and do show that there have been many persons who claim to be in a covenant to do the will of God, and who not only have shown their unwillingness to be obedient to God’s commandments but have caused divisions amongst God’s people by evil speaking and by speaking against the manner and means through which God carries on his kingdom work. Concerning such it is written: “Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward; he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.”—Prov. 22: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> Thus it is seen that the disobedient one, the murmurer and complainer, is led straightway into the trap of the Devil and becomes the enemy of God’s kingdom. Moses prophetically wrote concerning such as vowed to do God’s will and then took a perverse course: “And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.”—Deut. 32: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>23</sup> From time to time there are some who claim to be God’s servants, and who because of fear of receiving the disapproval of men have become offended, then murmur and complain, and withdraw from God’s organization and his service and return to worldly vocations. In order to find an excuse or justification for such action such persons indulge in perverse speech concerning the Lord’s organization on earth and murmur and complain and speak wickedly against those who are endeavoring to serve the Lord. Such is a froward or perverse person within the meaning of the Scriptures, and concerning such it is written: “Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. But these speak evil of those things which they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.”—Jude 8 and 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> Such perverse persons seek a personal reward or gain by posing in the presence of others, hoping to be classed as approved critics of God’s organization by reason of their feigned goodness, but are hypocritical; and concerning such Jude further says: “Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Co're. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear [of God]; clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withercth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.”—Jude 11,12,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TONGUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>M</sup> The tongue of the evil speaker becomes a snare, of which Satan takes advantage to entrap the one who claims to be devoted to the Lord and who indulges in evil speech: “A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.” (Prov. 18:7) Such persons hope to make themselves of good reputation among men by falsely accusing God’s organization and his servants, and, thus indulging in false and evil speech, they find themselves ensnared in Satan’s trap. One whom the Lord favors with a place in his organization, and which person occupies a position therein of confidence toward his organization and has in charge confidential matters, and who then assaults the organization with false and evil words, shows himself to have been ensnared by the wicked one. He discloses that he has ignored God’s Word and has been led by fear that he will not receive the approval of others unless he follows the course of evil speaking. Such a person shows that he has no fear of God, but that he does fear men, desiring their approval. He likewise shows that if he ever had a vision of the Kingdom he has entirely lost such vision. Having once started to serve the kingdom, unless that one has a vision of the Theocratic government and then wholly and completely devotes himself to and endeavors to promote the interest of the Theocracy, he is certain to be ensnared by the Devil. Being thus insincere, he indulges in evil speech against God’s organization, showing his offense against the Lord. What is the result of such ? Jesus answers: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.” (Matt. 13:41) The facts show that such persons generally return to the religious organization and indulge thereafter in religious practices by reason of being completely in the snare of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MILLIONS ENSNARED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>29</sup> There are numerous snares which the Devil has set for men, but without a doubt it is the religion snare that has caught the greatest number. Fear has led almost all of the people into that snare, who have thus been caught in the organizations. Millions have allied themselves with religious organizations, being induced to believe that they are thereby serving the Lord for self-protection. Concerning such it is written in the Word of God: “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” (Isa. 29:13) Thus it is shown that their fear is due to the teachings of men. That is exactly the condition of many religionists today; and the leaders in those religious organizations having proved their unfaithfulness to God and to their covenant, Jehovah then commits his “strange work” to his humble and obedient servants on the earth, and hence he uses them ‘to do a wonderful work’. (Isa. 29:14) Such privilege is denied religionists.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">&quot; Today the fear of men controls almost all who are a part of or under Satan’s organization. The entire world is “jittery”. The people of the world fear what men may do to them and what others may think of them, but they do not fear God, and are hence against him and his kingdom. The Lord Jesus pointed out specifically that this condition would exist at the end of the world, and all the facts prove that that prophecy is in course of fulfillment. (Luke 21:26) And what is the end of such fearful ones? The answer is found in the Scriptures, and the following are some of the texts: “I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, 0 Babylon, and thou wast not aware; thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord. The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.” (Jer. 50:24,25) “Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, 0 inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord. He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 48:43,44) “Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, 0 inhabitant of the earth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.”—Isa. 24:17,18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>28</sup> The ungodly and the wicked do not fear Jehovah, but they do fear men. “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” (Rom. 3:18) “But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.”—Eccl. 8:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>29</sup> But what of those who have made a covenant to do the will of God and who because of fear of creatures fail or refuse to serve God faithfully?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>80</sup> Suppose one claims to be in a covenant to do the will of God and has then committed to him service of a confidential nature in God’s organization and which confidential relationship he occupies and serves in for a time, and suppose such person suddenly conceives the idea that he must forsake the service of God’s organization and return to worldly pursuits, and in doing so he is moved by some selfish reason, such as fear of what men might think of him, that is, what his reputation might be amongst men if he continues in his position of service with God’s organization, or because he does not like and approve someone else in the Lord’s organization. As an excuse for returning to worldly pursuits he then writes and files with the Society a paper in which he makes many accusations against others who are serving in God’s organization. Desiring to have the approval of other men as to his course of action in leaving God’s organization, he notifies men in advance of his return to worldly pursuits and that he intends to do so because of his disapproval of the Society’s methods of carrying on the Lord’s work and of his disapproval of certain servants of the Society. What is his position with the Lord? (Rom. 14:4) The moving cause for such action is a failure to fear God and having a fear of men, that is to say, fearing that he will not receive man’s approval. Such a course of action shows a lack of love for God and hence a failure to perfect love and practice perfect love. “There is no fear [of men or devils] in love; but perfect love [of Jehovah and his kingdom] casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth [men] is not made perfect in love.”—1 John 4:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>81</sup> One who has “put his hand to the plow”, that is, has undertaken to serve God and the people of his organization, and who then turns back to worldly pursuits, shows a failure to fear God; and of such the Lord Jesus speaks: “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”—Luke 9: 62.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>82</sup> It is not for man to judge, but the judgment of the Lord has been written and it is man’s duty who serves the Lord to call attention to the same, in order that others may be warned of the snares and pitfalls in the way of those who are in a covenant to do God’s will. In the following text it is shown by the Lord Jesus that the fearful and unbelieving and abominable are all in the same class, and other texts of the Bible show that the fearful are those who fear they will not receive the approval of men, and concerning such the Lord Jesus says: “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burnetii with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.” (Rev. 21:8) One who has a vision of the kingdom now, and who loves the King, fears God, and thus continuing to fear God he will never turn back to the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MEANS OF ESCAPE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>88</sup> How can a man escape the snares of the Devil? “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29:25) Thus it is shown that one’s only safety is to put his trust wholly in the Lord. Fear of man leads into the Devil’s snare and into destruction. Fear of God is the way of escape from the Devil’s snare and leads to life. One who undertakes to serve God must love him, which means to be unselfishly devoted to God and to his service. That man who has unselfishly devoted himself to God’s service is pursuing a wise course: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10) Otherwise stated, the man does not begin to be wise until he fears God. He begins to see and to appreciate the relationship of man to Jehovah the Creator. He learns that God is the fountain of life. (Ps. 36: 9) Only those who fear God can receive the blessings of the fountain of life. “In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall have a place of refuge. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.”—Prov. 14: 26, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>34</sup> The man who fears God does not give heed to what other men may say about him. The wise man is one concerned altogether about what God may think of him. He craves the approval of God because he knows that he must have God’s approval before he can obtain life. To have the disapproval of Jehovah God means destruction. As the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom on the part of man, it follows that man must ever thereafter continue to fear God and particularly to fear that he might not receive God’s approval. The only means, therefore, of escaping the snare of the Devil is the fear of God and to have no fear whatsoever of man. The approval of man by the Lord God means everything. Jehovah therefore said to his typical covenant people, and his words with far greater force now apply to his covenant people on earth, to wit: “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary.”—Isa. 8:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>35</sup> That sanctuary is the holy place and the place of safety from the snares of the wicked one. For a Christian to manifest fear of man, even the fear that he would not receive the approval of man, is an open and direct insult to Jehovah God, and God permits him thus to be led into the Devil’s snare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>30</sup> This is the day of evil, the time of wickedness, and wickedness has gone to seed. It is the time of peril. For a Christian to have fear of man means lack of faith in God. Therefore says the Lord: “Let [Jehovah] be your fear, and let him be your dread.” He is the God of battle, and he will destroy the enemy, and all who ally themselves with the enemy will suffer destruction. Therefore the Christian at all times craves the approval of Almighty God and fears that he might come short of that approval. “Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.”—Heb. 4:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>87</sup> The Christian must devote himself wholly to God’s service and completely trust the Most High. For a Christian to fear that he might not have the approval of others is certain to result in his disapproval by the Lord God. His fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and if he continues to be wise he will continue to fear Jehovah and particularly to fear that he might fail to receive Jehovah’s approval. “In God I will praise his word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.” (Ps. 56: 4) “The Lord is on my side ; I will not fear; what can man do unto me?” (Ps. 118:6) “Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.”— Isa. 51:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE THEOCRACY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>88</sup> Jehovah’s government by Christ Jesus is The Theocracy. Set over against the Theocracy is Satan’s world, which soon shall be completely destroyed. The conflict between the Theocracy and Satan’s organization is therefore a deadly one. There can be no compromise. At the end every creature will be on the side of one or of the other. Only those who are of the Theocratic government, and those who find refuge under that Theocratic government, can hope for life. All opponents of the Theocracy are certain to be destroyed. The desire to have or seeking to have the favor of any part of Satan’s organization, or to have the approval of men of that organization or outside of it, means that such person does not have a vision of the Theocracy, or else he is deliberately and knowingly opposed to the Theocracy. In either case the result will be the same. The man who now has a vision of the kingdom with appreciation sees that everyone who is not for the kingdom is against it. “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattered) abroad.” (Matt. 12:30) Either one must be working for the kingdom or else he is against the kingdom. If a man has a vision of the kingdom, which God has now revealed to those who love him, that man loves the kingdom and will permit nothing to turn him away from a full devotion to and service of the kingdom. He sees that the kingdom is the means of the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name and is the only means of salvation for man. He sees that the Theocracy by Christ Jesus is the hope of humankind. (Matt. 12:18-21) He sees that one who enters into and becomes a part of the kingdom, or who finds protection under the kingdom, must be wholly and entirely devoted to God and to his King. He sees that all who receive life and the attending blessings thereof must have the approval of Jehovah, and therefore he gives heed to the admonition: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed”; nor does he fear what man might say about him. ((2 Tim. 2:15) He desires to have no part in the things of this world, and therefore he does not covet anything that the world can possibly give, including the approval of men. “Let your conversation [course of action] be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have [temporal things included]: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.”—Heb. 13: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>38</sup> One in a covenant with the Lord may be working in His organization by the side of one who does not please him. He may think that he has cause for offense because of the action of others of the Lord’s organization who are serving; but if he has a vision of the kingdom he will not permit that dislike of others to be an excuse for separating himself from the Lord’s organization and the service thereof, which he has undertaken by the Lord’s favor. He will have in mind that God is conducting his own affairs according to his own sovereign will, and that the Lord alone chooses his own servants. (Rom. 14:4) He knows that God alone is right and righteous, and if he has a vision of the kingdom he loves God and loves his law and so he continues in peace and contentment to serve in the place where he is put, and that without offense: “Great peace have they which love thy law; and nothing shall offend them.”—Ps. 119:165.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>40</sup> Having a vision of the kingdom, which is made possible for him by reason of the love of God and his King, that person fully determines that nothing shall separate him from the love and service of God and his King: “Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”—Rom. 8:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>41</sup> The man who now has a vision of the kingdom and who loves the kingdom beholds the glorious high Throne thereof, and he knows that such is the sanctuary of all who hope for life, and that there is none other. He knows that whether he lives or dies at the hand of the enemy his hope is in that glorious Theocracy and that it is the hope of all spiritual Israel, and of the “great multitude” that shall “fill the earth”. He appreciates the prophetic words recorded by Jeremiah and which apply to those who now trust Jehovah: “A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary. 0 Lord, the Hope of Israel [God’s faithful people], all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.”— Jer. 17:12,13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AVOIDS PITFALLS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>42</sup> The man who has a vision of the Theocracy, and whose hope is centered therein, walks circumspectly, fearing God, lest he fail to receive God’s approval. (Heb. 4:1) Therefore he watches out for snares or pitfalls and is diligent to avoid them. He shuns religion because he knows that religion is one of the most fatal snares set by the Devil. He refuses to have anything to do with religion, but, on the contrary, is diligent to warn those who will hear that religion is an abomination in the sight of Almighty God. He knows that, once having been enlightened concerning God’s purpose and his kingdom, to then turn again to the “beggarly elements” of the world means complete disapproval of God, ending in destruction. (Gal. 4: 9) “For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.”-2 Pet. 2:21,22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>42</sup> To him who visualizes the kingdom the full-time service to the King and kingdom is dearest to his heart, and he fears to lose the opportunity of service, and he will not voluntarily withdraw himself from that service for any reason.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>44</sup> The man visualizing the kingdom hates flattery, because he knows that flattery is a net into which he is liable to be caught and destroyed. “A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.” (Prov. 29:5) He yields not to flattery of one, even the one nearest to him, including his wife, because he believes, as it is written, “A flattering mouth worketh ruin.” (Prov. 26:28) He refuses to give flattery to men, knowing the danger resulting therefrom. Elihu, who pictured the faithful members of the body of Christ, with authority from God said: “Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person; neither let me give flattering titles unto man.” (Job 32: 21) “The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.” (Ps. 12:3) Therefore the man who loves God and has a vision of the Theocracy does not glory in himself or in his selfish attainments, hut glories in the Lord and in his kingdom. He does not desire or crave the approval of men, but he greatly desires and craves only the Lord’s commendation: “But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.” —2 Cor. 10:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>45</sup> The man who now has a vision of the kingdom and who has his heart fixed upon it casts away from him all fear of men or devils. He loves God, and he serves him wholly and continuously: “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment ; because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love easteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.”—1 John 4:16-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>46</sup> He who loves God does not fear that he might fail to receive the approval and commendation of men, because he knows that such fear opens before him a pit into which he is likely to fall. He does fear God, knowing that by fearing God he begins to be wise, and he desires to forever pursue a wise course, that he may receive God’s approval. Like the faithful apostle, he obeys God rather than men. (Acts 5: 29) Free from fear of the opponents of the Theocracy, he goes forward in obedience to his divinely given commission, proclaiming the good news with a light and joyful heart. He has entered into the joy of the Lord and craves to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4T</sup> A man who covenants to be obedient to God’s law may awake to the realization that he is tied in marriage to a woman who opposes the kingdom and who attempts to force her husband to cease serving the King. Even the wife may be also consecrated to the Lord but attempts to control her husband in the course of action W’hich he takes. The man who yields to such influence walks right into the pitfall or net set by the adversary. The one who has a vision of the kingdom recognizes that his first obligation is to Jehovah God and to his King, Christ Jesus, and he gives full consideration and obedience to the words of the King, to wit: “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.” (Luke 14:26) His love must be for God and against all who are against God’s government. Likewise the woman may find herself bound to a man who opposes the kingdom, but she is reminded that her first obligation is to Jehovah and his King and kingdom, and she takes the course of serving God first and all the time. To yield to any human creature because of fear that one will not receive the approval of men is certain to lead into a snare. Therefore the Christian who wholly devotes himself to the Lord, and who has a vision of the kingdom and continues to faithfully serve the King, rejoices that, so far as he is concerned, the snare set for him by the Devil has been broken and that he has escaped therefrom and found refuge and peace and safety in the Lord. Out of his mouth come with joy the appropriate words of the psalmist: “Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.”—Psalm 124: 6-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>48</sup> The members of the remnant yet on the earth, and who are in line for the kingdom, are in themselves very imperfect and hence make many mistakes. Those who are their “companions” are likewise imperfect and make mistakes. All such fully realize that their strength comes from the Lord and in his strength they can accomplish the work committed unto them. They know that if they keep a perfect heart devotion to God his everlasting strength will be manifested in their behalf: “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chron. 16:9) The faithful see and appreciate the greatness of the kingdom and that it is their privilege to firmly stand together and fight for their brethren and, doing so, to never yield because of fear of any man or devil and to never quail before the enemy. (Phil. 1: 27-29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font8"> They are not surprised when some do yield to fear and fall away to the enemy and are ensnared. The faithful do not sorrow or weep because of the fall of such, because to do so would be to violate God’s commandment.—Ezek. 24:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>49</sup> The faithful remnant and companions recognize the kingdom as the greatest creation of God, and in the kingdom is centered their hope. God has builded up Zion, his capital organization, and made Christ Jesus the Head thereof, and there Jehovah establishes his dwellingplace. (Ps. 132:13) Those who truly love and fear God, who are fully and completely devoted to him, have fixed their hearts upon the kingdom, and hence they joyfully sing the song of Jehovah’s prophet: “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God is known in her palaces for a refuge.” (Ps. 48:1-3) “Truly my soul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence: I shall not be greatly moved.” (Ps. 62:1, 2) “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.” (Ps. 145: 3) The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom: “The fear of [Jehovah] is clean, enduring for ever.” (Ps. 19:9) All those who get life shall fear Jehovah. “0 fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.” (Ps. 34:9) “Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.” (Ps. 33: 8) “With [Jehovah] is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in [Jehovah].”—Ps. 62:7, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark18"></a>SATAN NEVER IN HELL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">((JEHOVAH GOD declares in his Word that he permits I Satan to go on unhindered in his wicked work until the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> end of a certain and fixed time and at that time He would then destroy Satan and all of his agencies. When Jesus ascended on high Jehovah said to him: ‘You must wait until my due time to put down the enemy and destroy him.’ (Psalm 110:1) The Scriptures then show that the year 1914 marks the end of that period of time for waiting and the beginning of the reign of Christ. In his great prophecy recorded in Matthew [chapter] twenty-four Jesus states that that time would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence, revolution and distress of nations. A.11 of these things have come to pass since, and which began to have fulfillment in 1914. At that same time, the Scriptures show, a war was fought in heaven by Jesus and his angels against Satan and his forces and that Satan was ousted from heaven and east down to the earth.” (Quoted from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font6"> page 24) This statement of Scripture truth drew the fire of The Bellarmine Society of England, and that Jesuitic Society published this year (1939) an attack on the author of the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font6"> and in which attack, on page 3, it sarcastically said this, to wit, that the writer of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance </span><span class="font6">“has not thought it worth while explaining to us how Satan ever got back into heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This gibe is no doubt based on the teaching in the religious catechism, to wit: “All the angels did not remain good and happy; many of them sinned and were cast into hell; and these are called devils or bad angels”; to which a religious clergyman adds this further explanation: “One of these angels was most beautiful, and was named Lucifer, which means light-bearer. He was so perfect that he seems to have forgotten that he received all his beauty and intelligence from God, and, not content with what he had, became sinfully proud and wished to be equal to God Himself. For his sin he and all his followers were driven out of heaven, and God then created hell, in which they were to suffer for all eternity. This same Lucifer is now called Satan, and more commonly the devil, and those who accompanied him in his fall, devils, or fallen angels.”—Quoted from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Explanation of the Baltimore Catechism,</span><span class="font6"> 1921 edition, page 58, 38 Q., Imprimatur of archbishop of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Holy Scriptures do not bear out the thought that Satan has been debarred from appearing in heaven since the fall of man in Eden, nor at the time of the flood in Noah’s day. On the contrary, the Scriptures and the physical facts indicate that Satan was permitted to remain in heaven, God permitting it for a wise and good purpose. The context of Luke 10:18 shows that Jesus’ words there were prophetic of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In proof of this the following is submitted: Job, the man of Uz, probably lived about the time of Abraham. Certainly the experiences recorded of him occurred subsequent to the great deluge. Job 1:6 reads: “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came [along] also among them.” Without doubt at that time Satan was permitted to communicate with God, because there is recorded the conversation. The Lord spoke to Satan, and Satan responded. There he made an accusation against Job, showing that he had an opportunity to make accusations before Jehovah against the righteous; because Job was called a righteous man. (Job 1: 6-12; 2:1-7) To this agrees the vision of the prophet Micaiah in the days of King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. And the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? . . . And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets.”—1 Ki. 22:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the end of Satan is to be destruction there is no doubt. The inspired apostle, at Hebrews 2:14, writes: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, [Jesus] also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.” Lucifer, now Satan, was given charge over the perfect pair, Adam and Eve, in Eden, to shield, screen and protect them. That he was there for that purpose there is no doubt, because Ezekiel 28:13-15 says of him: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God, . . . Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: . . . Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” God gave to Adam his law. He plainly told Adam that a violation of God’s law would result in the enforcement of the death penalty. Since Lucifer was given charge over man to shield and protect him, it follows that he had the power to inflict punishment for any infraction of the rules or laws governing man. Lucifer was made the executive officer of Jehovah over man. Then it would seem it would be his right and duty to put man to death for violating God’s law. According to Hebrews 2:14, above quoted, there can be no doubt that he was given the power of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ezekiel 28:17 tells how Lucifer was impressed with his own beauty: “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.&quot; Addressing him under the figure of the king of Babylon (Satan’s organization), Isaiah 14:12-14 tells of the conception of Lucifer’s wicked scheme; “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” His heart was malignant ; that is, his purpose or motive secretly conceived was wicked. This does not prove that he was a usurper of power, but does prove he used the pow'er and authority with which he was clothed for his own selfish gratification. Be it here noted that Satan has tempted everyone of God’s righteous creatures along the same line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To carry out his wieked, diabolical scheme he told Eve that the eating of the forbidden fruit would not result in death. “Ye shall not surely die.” (Gen. 3:4,5) Intending doubtless to refuse to exercise against Adam and Eve the power of death, he expected to see them have the eyes of their understanding opened, that they would still live, and that they would then believe God to be a liar and believe Lucifer (Satan) to be their benefactor, and that therefore they would readily worship him and turn from God. In order that he might be adored and worshiped like the Most High God he was willing to betray his sacred trust, to make God out a liar and devoid of love; and he was willing to risk his own ability to save man from death. God knew of this wicked scheme in Satan’s heart, of course; and that was when iniquity was found in him.—Ezek. 28:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Satan’s destruction has been deferred until his wicked works are destroyed is sure. (See 1 John 3:8.) In pronouncing judgment against him Jehovah said: “I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain [kingdom] of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire [angelic hosts of heaven] . . . I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. . . . And never shalt thou be any more.”—Ezek. 28:16,18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the tragedy in Eden there were no nations on earth. But looking down to the end, in prophetic phrase God said to him: “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. Hell [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol;</span><span class="font6"> (Bible marginal reading) The grave] from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee.” (Isa. 14:12,15,9) These words of final judgment clearly refer to the future, both by reason of the phrase used and by the physical facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua</span><span class="font6"> means the same as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus,</span><span class="font6"> to wit, “Jehovah (is) Savior.” Jesus is the Head of The Christ of God. Jehovah God, through his prophet Zechariah, gives a picture of the development of The Christ. Zechariah 3:1-3 gives testimony to the fact that during the period of Christian sacrifice under the Greater Joshua, while the true Church has been in course of selection and development, Satan has been standing by to resist: “And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, 0 Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was in the wilderness forty days Satan appeared to him and boldly claimed that the world belonged to him, and that he had the right to give it to Jesus only upon condition that Jesus would fall down and worship him. He, at that time, still possessed the great desire to be worshiped as Jehovah is worshiped. (Luke 4:1-8) Jesus did not deny that claim to ownership of the world. On the contrary, Jesus spoke of Satan as “the prince of this world”.—John 12:31; 14: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Michael” means “who is like God?” and applies to “the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people”, to wit, Christ Jesus, who is the “prince of the kings [the 144,000] of the earth” and who is also “the express image of his [Jehovah God’s] person”. (See Daniel 12:1; Revelation 1:5,6; Hebrews 1:1-3.) The prophet Moses, who was of God’s people, was permitted to see the land of Canaan from a mountain height, but was not permitted to go into it. Moses died. It seems evident that Satan then possessed the power of death because he claimed the right to the body of Moses. Michael seems to have recognized that Satan still had some authority and official power at that time before the birth of Jesus, because it is recorded that he contended with the Devil about the body of Moses. “Yet Michael the archangel [chief messenger of Jehovah], when, contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him [Satan] a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.”—Jude 9; see also Deuteronomy 34 :1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Satan, up to A.D. 1914, has had access to heaven, and the privilege of communication with Jehovah, seems quite evident from the fact that during the period of Christian sacrifice he has been the accuser of Christ’s brethren day and night before Jehovah. At Revelation 12:10, the apostle John, writing of “things which must shortly come to pass” (Rev. 1:1), tells of the joy at Satan’s being cast out of heaven: “For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Michael, who is Christ the Lord, remained silent until his time to rule in the midst of his enemies had come. “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting [waiting] till his enemies be made his footstool.” (Heb. 10:12,13) (See also Psalm 110:1,2.) The time of Satan’s uninterrupted rule expired in A.D. 1914, as shown by prophecy and the physical facts. Daniel 12:1 reads: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There the Lord Jesus did stand up, and took his power to reign as representative of the Lord God Almighty. Hence it was then said: “We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” (Rev. 11:17,18) Then it was that there took place the birth of The Nation, Jehovah’s theocratic government or kingdom under Christ, and Christ Jesus was brought forth as Jehovah’s acting King on his throne, coming forth from Jehovah’s “woman” or holy organization Zion. Revelation 12:1-5, further describing “things which must shortly come to pass”, thus symbolically pictures the event: “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: and she being with child [the Kingdom] cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder [not down in hell, but] in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child [the Kingdom, Christ Jesus being the King], who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be expected that the first work the newly elevated and installed King, Christ Jesus, would do would be to throw the Devil out of heaven; and then and there the fight began. After describing the birth of the theocratic kingdom The Revelation 12:7-9 reads: “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was east out into the earth [not down into hell, or Sheol or Hades, which is the grave], and his angels were cast out with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No imaginary thing this! it was a real fight. The dragon and his official family, members of his invisible spirit government, fought and fought hard; but they lost, and were literally hurled out of heaven. It is inconsistent to think that Jesus, the righteous One, would take his power to reign in heaven in God’s due time and permit the Devil to remain there; and he did not. Both Satan and his angels, namely, his official family, his invisible joint-rulers of the wicked world organization, were hurled down to the earth. That fight must have begun in A.D. 1914, being accompanied by the world war of Satan’s visible organization on earth. Just how long thereafter the “war in heaven” lasted the Scriptures do not indicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was no more place found in heaven for the dragon and his angels, but they were cast out into the earth, and Revelation 12:12 says: “Therefore rejoiee, ye heavens [now freed from Satan the Devil], and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea 1 for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because lie knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Do not the physical facts bear witness that since A.D. 1914, particularly since 1918, there has been a greater element of wickedness in the earth than ever before, and that this wickedness is on the increase? Crimes, wickedness indescribable, and ascribable to none other than the Devil’s influence, have become a common thing in these years since then. When Satan was hurled out of heaven and into the earth, then there was “heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the kingdom</span><span class="font6"> of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is east down, which accused them before our God day and night.” (Rev. 12:10) This is further proof that the casting of Satan the Devil out of heaven did not take place until the Lord Jesus Christ took his power and began to reign, in A.D. 1914; and with the ousting of “that old dragon” from heaven comes the salvation of Jehovah’s royal family under Christ, the birth of the new Nation, the new and theocratic government, which is for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and for the salvation of men of good will and for the destruction of Satan and all of his organization. No wonder, then, that there should be great rejoicing!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark20"></a>LETTERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FULL DEVOTION TO KING OF ETERNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I will praise thee, 0 Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. ... I will sing praise to thy name, 0 thou Most High. For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: . . . Unto thee, 0 my strength, will I sing.”— Psalms 9:1,2; 18:39; 59:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With hearts overflowing with gratitude and praise to Jehovah and the beloved Vindicator of his name, we, Jehovah’s witnesses and companions of Kansas Zone 3, assembled this day in Wichita, Kansas, desire to express from the depths of our hearts our full devotion to the King of Eternity, and to declare in most emphatic terms our determination to stand uncompromisingly for the King and kingdom. Appreciating the loyal, courageous stand, Brother Rutherford, that you have taken in behalf of that kingdom we desire also at this time to send our greetings to you—may we make it quite clear, and that in all sincerity, that our appreciation of your untiring efforts in the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom and in the interests of your brethren is of such degree that we fail to find words to adequately express the same. Simply we say: It is our united prayer that Jehovah’s richest blessing be ever bestowed upon you; may you ever be in his favor as you continue to serve humbly and earnestly in the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having in mind the above-quoted words of the psalmist, we pray that Jehovah will place within our minds and hearts a keen and fervent desire and determination to be more diligent from this day henceforth in the work of giving praise to Him, and showing forth his marvelous works. Well do we realize that these are days of real battle, and only in the strength of Jehovah of Hosts are we able to stand. Be it known, therefore, that this day we do leave behind us all slackness, idleness and indifference toward the kingdom service, and by God’s grace we will serve the King and kingdom, and will vigorously proclaim the message thereof until Jehovah says “it’s done”. Realizing that the time draws nigh for Jehovah’s “strange work” to come to an end, we will hasten to declare the warning of the impending tribulation at Armageddon. It is our desire to aid all of good will, to the end that they may take a firm stand for the kingdom before it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We rejoice as we call to mind the ringing words, to wit: “Onward, soldiers of the Lord!” What a blessed privilege is ours! Action! Action!! And more action upon the battlefield, going forth with the assurance that we are fighting a winning fight under the command of the Almighty Warrior! Our hearts are filled with inexpressible joy as we realize that we are not meeting the enemy in our own strength, but rather meeting them ‘in the name and strength of Jehovah of Hosts, whom they have defied’! To see the part we are permitted to have in the fulfillment of the many prophetic dramas causes us to strive all the harder to have some small part at least in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. May Jehovah ‘gird us with strength unto the battle’. Well do we realize that within ourselves there is no strength, but Jehovah is the strength of his people. Therefore let the enemy come on and fight 1 Let them come forth with great pride and boastfulness. Let them say, “Oh, we’re strong!” God’s people welcome the fight which will prove that Jehovah is supreme. We are ready. We are prepared. We are armed in the cause of righteousness and truth, and we have full assurance that our God will sustain us in the time of great peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be it known, therefore, that tbis constitutes a fighting declaration on our part. To be sure, we are not fighting men; our weapons are not carnal. We have no hatred or ill will toward anyone, but we are unalterably opposed to anything that Satan brings against the Kingdom under Christ, and we have fully determined, and that without reservation, to stand for the Theocratic government first, last, and all the time. We are mindful that in this fight we will suffer at the hands of Satan’s agents; so be it. Some may die; even so, our only petition is: “God grant that we prove faithful to the very last, thereby proving Satan the liar that he is, and Jehovah to be true.” Even now we know that our brethren in many lands are being violently persecuted. Our hearts and prayers are with and for them as they stand firm in the strength of the Lord. We rejoice to know that ere long Satan and his entire organization shall be smitten to the dust, and Jehovah’s own great name exalted and vindicated, and his people delivered. Praise ye His name forever!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Assuring you of full co-operation in the fight for the kingdom, and with best wishes and warmest Christian love, we remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brethren in the Lord’s army,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kansas Zone 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOW SERVES GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although we have been in the witness work since 1920 this is the first time we have ever written you. This has not been because of lack of appreciation of your devotion and faithfulness to Jehovah. We have hesitated to interfere with your important work in the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now we come in behalf of an old man of good will whom we have found in our territory. He was born in Switzerland and was once a Catholic. After having sent for some French literature for him, he wrote for a French Bible. He has asked us to tell you that he loves you for your faithfulness and that he serves the same God as you do although he is of different nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we study the recent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font6"> and look back upon the years since we first started in the service with a team and covered wagon, we realize we are just beginning to appreciate the privilege we have had in carrying the message of the kingdom to others. And may we take this opportunity to thank Jehovah and you for the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yours in the interest of the Theocracy, Mrs. H. H. Nichols and Helen, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARREST AFFORDED OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This note is an expression of deep appreciation to Jehovah and to you, one of his witnesses, for the refreshments and instruction contained in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> and now the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font6">book, a well of sparkling waters for a barren and parched humanity. The Westwood arrest afforded an opportunity to take the stand and declare some of its contents to the court, lawyers, and crowded courtroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we approach the darkest time in earth’s history and (I have heard the mob crying for your blood) when the responsibilities of your office are so vast, there seems to be no good reason why you should sit on tacks and wear itchy underwear to show that you are suffering for Christ. I know that your love for all of the Lord’s little ones is limited only by your capacity to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yours in the Lord’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">D. E. Morgan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VICTORY IN A MILL-OWNED GEORGIA VILLAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I succeeded in reaching the officials of the Tubize Silk Mill, who for years have interfered with the Kingdom work in the village. I requested an appointment with the manager, who was very secluded. I had to state the nature of my business at the Information Desk. After prolonged ’phone conversation I was requested to be seated, that he would see me. Presently the preacher appeared and was ushered in without any formality. Then the assistant chief of police entered. They were in conference for some time. When they departed I was told that the manager had referred me to the personnel man. I explained the work, our method of doing it, stating my attention had been called to the interference with Jehovah’s witnesses in the village by the officials for several years, they declaring the village was private property, that no one could visit the homes of the employees without first getting permission. I reviewed the Supreme Court ruling with him when he declared that ruling did not apply to them but to a municipal corporation. I assured him it did apply to his village and that the State court gave a person the right to enter and leave his premises without interference; also any guest could do the same if peaceable. In reply he stated: ‘Brother, you can’t bluff me, and I’m making the statement </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font6"> can’t do your work here.’ I assured him we were not bluffing, but that I would make a positive statement to him that the work would be done and I was asking him not to interfere with it. He then asked for time to consult his attorney. Result: We could do the work all right, but if we disturbed the sleepers we would be run out. I warned him against interference, and as for running us out, that would be settled later. Last Monday, August 6, the Rome (Ga.) locusts invaded the village and ate up the varnish while Mr. Preacher, Mr. Policeman and Mr. Personnel Man watched, but no interference. So the King triumphed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MORE COURAGE, THE BETTER THE RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Personally I felt up against a stone wall. I had plenty of literature and pioneer territoiy, and no grub nor money. The zone servant arrived next day. Meeting went fine. Following day we went out together in the witness work. I observed carefully the confidence, kindness and fearlessness with which he approached people. I recalled the remark of Judge Rutherford: ‘Henceforth we will take the offensive in this warfare . . . ’ The next day I went out determined to be bold in proclaiming the truth (though not rude). In seventeen hours (two days’ work, I placed ten </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font6"> 25 booklets, had 27 sound attendar and made three back-ealls, one hour each. Montana is a w ide and vast country, but I am convinced that the more courageous we are the better results we get. The coyotes are yapping on the hill in the timber near by.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RURAL TELEPHONE PHONOGRAPH SETUP (SASK.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘He said: ‘My son was telling us all about it. I would like to hear more, and I wish my wife was here as well.’ I put on the record ‘Relief’. When it was about half through he mumbled something about getting her (his wife) on the telephone; which he did as soon as the record was finished. I put on ‘Resolution’ and a loud-tone needle and held the phonograph up to the ’phone. He kept the receiver at his ear, and during the lecture he whispered to me that there were two listening in (which is common on these Saskatchewan rural telephone lines). His wife said she heard and liked it all. I then arranged a back-call for a later date.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXAS SOUND-CAR CO-ORDINATED WITH MARCHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When we were all prepared to march there were 22 in this march. The sound-car played a march and the marchers, keeping 15 feet apart, marched through the main streets of the city. Every so often the sound-car announced the plaee of meeting, the Court House square, where ‘Fascism or Freedom’ was played. About 100 heard the lecture, and two men came up to the operator of the soundear, identified themselves with the work, and each obtained </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font6"> and one of the men asked that a meeting be started in his home. Immediately after the lecture we left for another small town, eight miles away. There had been considerable opposition here while working with the books. When the march started a man rushed out of a store and accosted the leader, asking where his permit to march was. Without stopping, the marcher said: ‘We need no permit to advertise the Kingdom.’ The sound-car operator obtained permission to park his car on an empty lot in the business district and went down the street announcing that Fascism would be exposed in a few minutes at the Economy Feed Store corner. Several Catholics came to the car and attempted to start an argument. The windows were up to prevent damage to the equipment, and the lecture went on Several would stand and listen for a while, then walk away, astounded at the information given. One man contributed 50c, saying he realized this was a good work, although he was not much interested in Rutherford. I believe the soundcar, used in this way, advertising the marches and plaee of meeting, will be of great help to those wishing to identify themselves with Jehovah’s organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AMONG TEXANS TENTING LIKE JONADAB</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Disregarding the sandstorm, which was doing much havoc, we decided to work these tents down near and under the river bridge. The sand was blowing too much to continue using the phonograph at this time, and as I announced myself as ‘one of Jehovah’s witnesses’ a voice quickly welcomed me, saying: ‘I don’t know who you are, but if you have any books like this I sure do want them.’ I had to look a second time before I recognized the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> booklet he held up, for it was so disfigured, the back torn completely off, and it was soiled and rumpled. He had been so down and out—no work, nothing for him to live for—and had even considered suicide. 'When coining along the highway, someone had thrown this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> out of the car and it had landed in his face. He examined it and found it the best reading he bad ever had. He saw it was the truth and that he did have much to live for. Of course, I left him magazines and more books and the address of the meeting. He said he wanted to come soon to meetings and insisted upon contributing his last dime towards the literature, even though I had given it to him. A few days later, when I went back to make a back-call, he was gone. The people in the tent next told me he had been called to take a good job a few hundred miles from there and he had gotten them to read some of the booklets. I am sure he will never rest until he has gotten in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses where-cver he goes.”</span></p>

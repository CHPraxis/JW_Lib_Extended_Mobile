<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DRAMA OF VINDICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law.” —J osh. 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH was never under any obligation to disclose to human creatures the means of executing his purpose in vindication of his name. What he has done is a manifestation of his loving-kindness toward those who obey him. God has caused to be enacted and recorded many prophetic pictures setting forth in detail the manner of carrying out his purpose. “The last days” are here, and these are times of peril, and Satan and his forces are viciously assaulting the people of God, and for the purpose of giving to those faithful ones courage and comfort and hope Jehovah now reveals to them the manner of carrying out his purpose, and this he does through prophetic pictures. (Rom. 15:4) Because Christ Jesus, the Beloved One, is the Executive Officer and Vindicator of Jehovah, the prophetic pictures identify him specifically. Aside from Jesus, however, the prophetic pictures do not foretell or foreshadow individuals and do not show God’s dealing with individuals, but do set forth the work of God and Christ in which the faithful people of God are privileged to have some part. Individuals are not important, but the work in which they engage is important. Generally the faithful are permitted to have some part in the Lord’s work relating to the execution of his purpose, and thereafter they are permitted, by the grace of God, to see how they have been led by the hand of the Lord and used in his service. Such revelation serves to increase their faith and courage, and hence they joyfully sing the praises of God and say: “By his hand he leadeth me.” Surrounded by the enemy that viciously assaults the “remnant” and their “companions”, these faithful ones, full of faith and confidence in the Lord, say: “In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. For thou art my rock and my fortress: therefore, for thy name’s sake, lead me and guide me.”—Ps. 31:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* Prophetic pictures enable those who trust Jehovah to keep in mind that underneath are his everlasting arms’ bearing them up (Deut. 33:27), that the battle is God’s and not man’s, and that the victory is with Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and that those who remain true and steadfast shall profit by that victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah withdrew his chosen people from the land of Egypt, and by the hand of his servant Moses he led them for forty years on a trek through the wilderness, using them in that time to make pictures of greater things that must come to pass in future days. When Moses had about finished the work committed into his hands he assembled the Israelites on the plains of Moab and there recounted to them what God had done for them and instructed them what they must do in the days to come. That instruction was given for the benefit of the antitypical Israelites, the true followers of Christ Jesus, whom God builds up into his capital organization. Finishing his work, Moses died, and Joshua was assigned to the place once filled by Moses. God was about to enact a prophetic drama foretelling events that lead up to the full vindication of his name. Those dramas which are here considered were, to wit: The crossing of the Jordan; Rahab, who because of her faithfulness gained God’s approval; the siege and fall of Jericho; sin in the ranks of God’s typical people; and the assault upon and destruction of Ai. The fulfillment of these prophetic pictures are today of keenest interest to the people of God on earth who are in a covenant with him to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">* This drama opens with Joshua in command of the host of Israel, which host were encamped on the plains of Moab waiting the commandment from their visible leader: “Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister.” (Josh. 1:1) There Joshua pictures the Lord Jesus Christ, engaged in the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name and in which work he associates with himself his faithful followers on the earth. The death of Moses and the transfer of authority to Joshua pictures the transition period from the “Elijah work” of the Lord to the “Elisha work” of the church under the direction of its Head, Christ Jesus. Joshua had been the ‘minister of Moses’, just as, thereafter, Elisha was minister to Elijah. (Ex. 24:13) Before his death Moses, at God’s command, had invested Joshua with authority as his successor to lead the Israelites into the promised land. (Num. 27:12-23; Deut. 31:14) Likewise Elijah, in obedience to God’s command, designated Elisha as his successor. (1 Ki. 19:13-21) The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span><span class="font6"> means “drawing” or “rescued”, as he was rescued from the waters of the Nile, and the suggestion is also that of God ‘taking out a people for his name’ during the period of time from A.D. 1878 to 1918. The death of Moses was due to his disobedience of God. (Num. 20: 7-12, 24) This pictured the death of the Elijah work, which work came to an end because of the ‘lawlessness of lip* of Jehovah’s servant class on the earth and fleeing for fear, as Elijah fled from before Jezebel. (Isa. 6: 5, 7; 1 Ki. 19:1-3) The prophetic picture and the physical facts exactly fit, and therefore we are certain we have the right understanding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• Moses died in the last month, that is to say, the twelfth month of the fortieth and last year of Israel’s wilderness journey. Israel mourned thirty days from his death, and at the end thereof only three days remained before the host of Israel must cross the river Jordan, which they did on the tenth day of Nisan or tenth day of the new year, that is, the forty-first year after their leaving Egypt. (Deut. 34:7,8; Josh. 1:10,11; 4:19) The period of mourning for Moses well pictures the period or duration of time during which the witness work was stopped by the acts of the enemy in the spring of 1918 and when some of the witnesses of the Lord were imprisoned and “appointed to die”. That period of time is there pictured as ‘a half hour of silence in heaven’. (Rev. 8:1) This period or pause was shown in the prophetic picture when, after Elijah had been taken away, Elisha returned to the Jordan and stood over on its eastern banks just opposite from Jericho, at the same place where Joshua had crossed the Jordan centuries before.—2 Ki. 2:4-8,11-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• In fulfillment of the picture the events began to come to pass in A.D. 1918. Thus it appears that the covenant people at the end of the world (1914) would not cross over their Jordan, nor did they do so, before or during the year 1918. Moses, leading the Israelites, reached Moab on the east side of the Jordan at the end of forty years and came over opposite Jericho, and Moses still lived. So Jehovah’s covenant people during the Elijah work survived until the end of A.D. 1918, when the Elijah work came to an end. Israel’s victory over Sihon the Amorite and Og, the king of Bashan, was accomplished before the death of Moses and, of course, before the time of crossing the Jordan; so, while the Elijah work was yet alive and active, the Greater Moses, the Lord Jesus Christ, gained the victory over Satan in a “war in heaven” and cast Satan and his angels to the earth, and this was accomplished between 1914 and 1918. (Rev. 12:1-9) The Devil tried to prevent the Israelites from crossing the Jordan, by causing the unfaithful Balaam to curse Israel and by turning some of the Israelites to the devilish religious practice of Baal-peor. (Numbers, chapters 22 to 25) Satan has made similar efforts against Jehovah’s witnesses to prevent their crossing the antitypical Jordan and moving against the modern-day Jericho, and Satan has failed in this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>T</sup> At the end of forty years, as it is written, “it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua.” At that time a settled place had been assigned to the Israelites by Jehovah, which country was on both sides of the Jordan river, and that part on the east side of the Jordan was already occupied by some of the tribes. Unlike Abraham and other faithful prophets of Israel, who “looked for a city which hath foundations”, having faith in the coming kingdom of God under the Messiah, the Israelites were now certain of their assigned place, and in their assigned territory pictured the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who, in 1918, had arrived at the kingdom country represented by Jesus’ coming to the temple. (Mal. 3:1-3) The King, Christ Jesus, was enthroned in 1914, and in 1918 appeared at the temple, and the journey of the antitypical Israelites unto the kingdom had come to an end. The time of the fulfillment of the prophetic picture here made is therefore definitely fixed. This, however, we could not see, understand and appreciate until after the facts had been performed and came to mind which exactly fit the prophecy and thus show its fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The original name of Joshua was Hoshea or Oshea. (Deut. 32:44, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font6"> Moses, as the representative of the Lord God, had given Joshua a new name, to wit, “Joshua,” which means “Jehovah the Savior”. (Num. 13: 8,16) That “new name” was given to Joshua at the time Moses sent twelve spies into Canaan. The change of name shows that Joshua would magnify and celebrate the name of Jehovah God. Likewise Jehovah’s people, the faithful followers of Jesus Christ, originally known at times as “Bible Students”, received the “new name”, Jehovah’s witnesses, and they must magnify the name of Jehovah God. (Rev. 2:17; Isa. 62:2; 65:15) At Acts 7:45 and at Hebrews 4:8 the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font6"> is used instead of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua, Jesus</span><span class="font6"> being the name in Greek and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua</span><span class="font6"> the name in Hebrew. The father of Joshua was named Nun, and that name means “perpetuity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•Joshua therefore pictured Christ Jesus, the Son of the only perpetuating one, Jehovah God, and this particularly after 1918, when Christ engaged in the work of vindicating his Father’s name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Joshua descended from Joseph, through Joseph’s son Ephraim. Joshua was born in Egypt, where he served as a slave, and at the end of forty years’ wilderness journey he was approximately ninety years old. He was preserved by the Lord to cross the Jordan into Canaan because he and Caleb brought back a good and faithful report after spying out the land, on which mission they had been sent by Moses. (Num. 13:17; 14: 6-10,30) He fought in battles for the name of Jehovah before reaching the Jordan and crossing it. He took command of Israel in Shittim, on the east side of Jordan, opposite Jericho. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Shittim</span><span class="font6"> means “Acacias” or “scourge trees”, by reason of the thorns on them. (Num. 25:1; 33:48-53; Josh. 2:1) Likewise Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, came to the temple and took direct command of God’s people on earth amidst a time of scourge or trouble upon the faithful remnant, which was brought on them by the &quot;scourge trees” of human creatures acting under Satan’s command. Joshua assigned three cities of refuge west of the Jordan, in addition to the three cities of refuge Moses had assigned east of the Jordan. (Joshua, twentieth chapter) Joshua began the celebration of the feast of tabernacles in the land of Canaan after crossing the Jordan. (Neh. 8:17) These definite facts further serve to fix the time of fulfillment of the book of Joshua as after 1918, as this will be observed as progress is made in this study. This is further and conclusive proof that all things recorded in that book were written aforetime for the special aid of the faithful people of God upon whom the ends of the world have come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Not until A.D. 1919 did the faithful followers of Christ Jesus then on earth realize that the Elijah work had ended. In the picture the Lord said to Joshua: “Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.” (Josh.. 1:2) The Elijah work likewise was then dead, and the Elisha work must be done from that time forward. The Lord, without a question of doubt, directed and caused to be published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> August 1 and 15, 1919, the articles under the title “Blessed Are the Fearless”, which brought forth the distinction between the Elijah and the Elisha work and showing that the Elijah work was done and that the Elisha work must begin, and that without any fear of the enemy. The same message was published and publicly proclaimed at the Cedar Point (Ohio) convention in September of that same year. Of the Israelites that came out of Egypt only a remnant, Joshua, Caleb and Eleazar, survived and crossed the Jordan and entered the land of Canaan. Even so also only a small remnant of those who, during the Elijah period, covenanted to do the will of God, and hence who left antitypical Egypt, survived the Elijah period and came over the antitypical Jordan and engaged in the Elisha work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">** As the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua were commanded to arise, cross the Jordan and take possession of the land occupied by the enemy, so likewise the faithful followers of Christ Jesus under his leadership were commanded to engage in the kingdom work and to take possession of the land, which the enemy had been permitted to occupy and claim. From that time onward activity must increase to its full limit, and this is shown by the command of the Lord to Joshua, to wit: “Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.” (Josh. 1:3,4) Also for the benefit of Jehovah’s witnesses God said to the Israelites who stood on the east side of the Jordan: “There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”—Josh. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COURAGEOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” To be courageous one must have full faith and confidence in the power that is backing him up, and relying completely on that power he must vigorously press forward in doing the work that is set before him. Therefore it is written: “According to your faith be it unto you.” The command to Joshua to take with him across the Jordan “all this people’’ proves that Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Joshua, makes his faithful followers share with him in his kingdom work, and which faithful ones become his joint-heirs in the kingdom. His faithful followers need not be fearful; they do need to be very courageous in order to meet the onslaughts of the enemy; and this is further shown by the words of the Lord spoken through Joshua: “Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.” (Josh. 1:6) Jehovah covenanted with Jesus the kingdom, and Jesus covenants with his faithful followers that they shall share with him in that kingdom by the grace and according to the will of God.—Luke 22: 29, 30, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Full faith and great boldness are required to carry forward the Elisha work, and certainly greater courage than was required to do the Elijah work, because of the more strenuous opposition. In proof thereof are these words of Joshua: “Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”—Josh. 1:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’‘The Lord does not require that his people do spectacular things, but does command that they be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and have full faith in his power. They must be very courageous, and hence must not permit the slightest doubt in mind that God can carry out every word he has promised and that he will do so, and that as long as they serve him in obedience to his commandments no power can prevent the doing of the work which he has assigned them to do. Having this courage, they go forward with joy. Jehovah’s witnesses have been put to the test during the period of the Elisha work and can fully realize what is here stated. His witnesses have come to well know that they must study the Word of God and be fully obedient to his law if they would have God’s guidance and protection. They are not to turn aside to discuss with opponents their views; they do not need to hear the arguments of all opposers; they are to rely solely upon the Lord and, knowing that his Word is true, they go forward, and in so doing the Lord says to them that “thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest”. God’s people must feed upon his Word, which is, as Joshua stated, “this book of the law.” They must study it and carefully meditate upon it at all times and follow carefully the instruction given therein. Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Joshua, is leading his people and instructing them from the temple, which instructions he transmits to his people in his appointed way and channel, and Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to follow his instructions so transmitted to them, and, doing so, the promise is to them: “Thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.” The Devil’s agents viciously assault Jehovah’s witnesses, threaten and abuse them, and attempt to wrongfully enforce their laws against them and to compel Jehovah’s witnesses to do according to the law of the land, which forbids the publication of God’s message without a permit from some human power. But the Lord’s faithful servants will not be deterred from doing their duty by reason of such threats, nor by fines, scourgings and imprisonment. At all times they have in mind the power that is behind them and backing them up and they know that “underneath are the everlasting arms” of the Most High and in due time, as God has promised, “he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee.” —Deut. 33:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> The commandment that Jehovah gave to Joshua and other Israelites, as set out in the foregoing scripture spoken by Joshua, indicates that there would be an occasion for fear on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses during the period of the Elisha work and that some of them would be inclined to go easy and let up on a vigorous campaign, but that the faithful would not do so. Such are exactly the facts, as many of Jehovah’s witnesses can now testify. The less zealous ones have admonished some of the others to be less aggressive and not to bring upon their heads by their acts the vicious assaults of the enemy, but the Lord says to them: “Have not I commanded thee ? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”—Josh. 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” When assaulted because of preaching the gospel, and when persecuted for boldly giving the warning to the people as commanded by the Lord, and when commanded by worldly officials that Jehovah’s witnesses must cease their activities, the faithful and courageous ones have replied and continue to reply: ‘We ought to obey God, and not man.’ Our God has commanded us; his will we will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Those who by reason of fear of man refuse or fail to do the Elisha work cannot have the approval of the Lord, and they cannot have “good success”, because such lack in faith and confidence in the Lord. Those who really love God and his kingdom will not be afraid, and this conclusion is fully supported by the inspired words of the apostle: “Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.”— 1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The kingdom is here, and Christ the King knows no defeat. He will get the victory. The enemy will bluff and bluster and threaten to inflict bodily punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses, but the enemy cannot stop the witness work and it will not stop until finished and until God permits it to be stopped. As Jehovah said to Joshua and the other Israelites, so now he says to his faithful people on earth when facing the enemy: “Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” Today the fight is on, and the faithful, with good courage, are proclaiming Jehovah’s praises and are relying upon the promises of Jehovah, well knowing that ‘the battle is not man’s, but God’s’. The foregoing facts well known, and which have been experienced by many of Jehovah’s witnesses in the recent past, prove also that the prophetic drama, of the book of Joshua concerning the host crossing the Jordan, had its beginning towards fulfillment in 1919 and continues in course of fulfillment to this very day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEGINNING OF FULFILLMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> The imprisonment of some of the Lord’s servants in 1918 put fear into the minds of many of the others. In the spring of 1919 those imprisoned ones were released and the Lord’s people began to get more courage. The command given by Joshua was likewise given in 1919 by the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, to wit: “Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it.”—Josh. 1:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> To prepare victuals is necessary for a journey or continuous activity. It was in the year 1919 that activity began in preparation for the publication of a magazine and other publications and for the building up of the service organization, and that continued for three years, until 1922, when the visible organization of the Lord God was well under way and pushed forward in the increased witness work. During that period much work of preparation had to be done, however, and that work was done. Spiritual food was necessary, and the Lord provided it; his servants, having their minds illuminated by the revealed purposes of God, put forth greater zeal in doing what was given them to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> In fulfillment of the prophetic picture everyone who had covenanted to do the will of God and who had been faithful up to the coming of the Lord to the temple and had received the Lord’s favorable judgment must go forward and do the kingdom work. The “three days” mentioned by Joshua corresponds to the three years in fulfillment of the prophecy from 1919 to 1922. Verses twelve to eighteen of Joshua one shows that there shall be no slacking of the hand, but the work must be done with energy. The original and faithful Elijah workers must now go into the service and do the Elisha work. No one of the remnant could be exempt from that service. No one could rest on his past laurel; and say, ‘I have done my part; let the others do it now’; but all must faithfully share the work with their fellows. No one could hire a substitute to work for him and leave that work to be done by someone else; but he must work himself. Those attempting to take such a course of shirking or failing to do the work were warned by the words which Moses spoke: “Be sure your sin will find you out.&quot; (Num. 32:19-23) Those faithful in the service heard the command by Joshua and obeyed: “And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.” (Josh. .1:16) Those words express the right sentiment of one engaged in the Elisha work, willing to work, and to be willing to work in any place to which he may be assigned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> During the Elisha work those who have really shown their love for God and his kingdom have said in response to the call to go forth in the service, even as the Israelites said to Joshua: “According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.”—Josh. 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> The prophecy indicated that there would be some fearful and who would be rebellious, and the facts show that some were fearful or indifferent and did rebel against the commandments of the Lord, and concerning such it is written: “Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.”—Josh. 1:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Those of the Elisha period who have been fearful and indifferent and have rebelled have been cast out. The faithful ones have had no time nor inclination to mourn over those who have fallen away, but they have joyfully acquiesced in the judgment of the Lord in putting out the unfaithful. To one another the faithful have said and continue to say: “Only the Lord thy God be with thee, . . . only be strong and of a good courage.’’ These words foretold those who were full of faith, confidence and courage, and who would maintain their integrity toward God, doing the Elisha work. As they had gone forward in the Elijah work they continued to go forward in the witness work in the Elisha period, and they have been given understanding and an appreciation of that work in which they are engaged, knowing it has to do with the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The Lord has illuminated their minds and shown them that these prophetic dramas are pictures of vindication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">spies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Another act in the drama is staged at this point, showing another part of the work performed. Men were sent by Joshua to spy out the land beyond the Jordan before the Israelites began to move across. “And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.” (Josh. 2:1) The names of the two men are not given, because the individuals are not important, but it appears that probably one of them was Salmon, who afterward married Rahab. It was a dangerous mission to which those men were assigned, and they went about it with discretion and secretly. Thirty-nine years before that Moses had sent out Joshua and eleven other men on a similar dangerous mission to the same land. In fulfillment, the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, also sent out his representatives in due time to do work assigned to them; as it is written: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.”— John 17:17,18,20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>,T</sup> The two men sent out by Joshua represented all Israel. They would take a view of the enemy organization and the people in and about Jericho, and their attitude toward the Israelites, because at that time the people of Jericho had heard of the coming of the Israelites. Their coming would afford an opportunity to the people of Jericho to do either good or evil to the two messengers. The spying out of the land was not needed by Jehovah before he could act against Jericho, and it is therefore certain that Jehovah was here making a picture for the benefit of others. He caused Joshua to display proper caution in not counting on Jehovah to do everything while certain things were within the power and permission of humans to do them. Also it was a test on those two spies as to their faith in the Lord, just as the twelve spies had to show their faith, having it tested, after Moses sent them into Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Another part of this picture is that Jehovah discerned a woman in Jericho who did show faith in God and who was used to make a part of the prophetic drama, and that part of the picture shows that she was given the opportunity by her acts to show her faith in God and thus to gain his approval, which approval assured her that she might be spared when Jericho would fall. On another occasion God sent two angels down to Sodom and afforded an opportunity for Lot to demonstrate his faith, that he might be saved when Sodom was destroyed. (Gen. 18:16; 19:1) The fulfillment of this part of the prophetic drama concerning the spies and the woman is after 1918, when Jehovah’s witnesses went forth to do the work assigned to them by Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua. There being “two men” in the picture suggests the two parts that engage in the work and that go to make up the remnant of the witnesses of Jehovah, that is to say, the older and the younger part. The older were the ones that survived the period of Elijah and the persecution of 1919, and who continued to be faithful, and whom the Lord Jesus formed into the “faithful and wise servant” (Matt. 24:45-47), and the second or newer part was composed of those who became members of the “faithful and wise servant” from and after 1922. Both parts were foreshadowed by Naomi and Ruth, and by Mordecai and Esther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The spies were commanded to view the land, and particularly the city of Jericho and the environment. The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jericho</span><span class="font6"> means (1) “Fragrance”, probably due to its situation in a place of fragrance produced by the growth of fragrant shrubs in abundance thereabout; it also means the “city of palm trees” (Deut. 34:3); and (2) its name signifies “its month”, which may mean that the people of Jericho worshiped the moon god. The people of that city were descendants of Canaan, who was a son of Ham and who came under Noah’s curse. (Gen. 10:15,16; 9:25,26) This shows that the people of Jericho were cousins of Nimrod (Genesis 10: 6-9) and hence they were worshipers of the Devil. The city of Jericho was full of treasure and had commercial traffic with Babylon. (Josh. 6:24; 7:21) The city was situated on what later became the border of Ephraim, but which territory was bestowed upon the tribe of Benjamin. (Josh. 18:21; 16:7) The description of Jericho, its surrounding conditions and its people, shows that it pictured the religionists of the “present evil world” and known as “Christendom”, and which religionists practice what is improperly called “the Christian religion”, but which is in fact the practice of the Devil’s religion. “Christendom,” by its religious practice, attempts to make itself “fragrant”, and its practitioners ‘smell sweet and look wise’ This they do by applying to themselves the beauties and blessed promises of the Bible respecting those who are the true followers of Christ Jesus, and which Bible texts have no application to them “Christendom” claims to be the organization of the upright ones, that is to say, ones that grow up right as the palm trees do. (Jer. 10:5; Ps. 92:12) But “Christendom” is as crooked as a gimlet. It has the form of godliness or godly piety but denies the power of Jehovah God and worships the creature instead of the Creator, giving honor and praise to men, and not to God and the Lord Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus is authority for the statement that “Christendom” is the product of the Devil, and for the judgment of Jehovah written against “Christendom” that she is to be brought low, greatly “humiliated”, and destroyed; which is the meaning of the name “Canaanite”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The city of Jericho was to be the first city of Canaan to be delivered by Jehovah into the hands of Joshua, his officer leading the host of Israel. It therefore must be the one offered up to Jehovah as the firstfruits of Canaan. The Israelites might let other cities stand, but not so with Jericho. She had to go down. (Deut. 6:10,11) Likewise there is no possibility for “Christendom” to stand. Like Jericho, she must be completely destroyed. At Armageddon “Christendom” is the Lord’s first point of attack, as shown by many of the Scriptures. His armies will destroy it first, and it will never be restored or revived. As a devoted thing it is a cursed thing and must be completely blotted out. — Lev. 27:28,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> Now as to the fulfillment of that part of the picture concerning the “two men”. They represented Jehovah’s witnesses, who spy out the land, the modern Jericho, “Christendom.” This is fulfilled in the fact that Jehovah makes clear to them in his Word concerning Satan’s organization that it is religion which forms the chief part thereof, and by which the people are held together in subjection. Jehovah’s witnesses, by studying the revealed prophecies and by comparing them with the physical facts of history as well as the facts of the present day, discern the fulfillment and the meaning of the prophecies, and thus they are encouraged, and their hope strengthened, to press on. Such discernment, particularly of the enemy organization, began to be made known by the Lord to his people through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> as early as 1921. Note therein the article on Joshua 1:9, “Be of Good Courage,” pages 90 and 91, where “the Devil’s organization” was mentioned for the first time. The opposition of Satan’s organization to the kingdom of God was clarified still more when the Lord Jesus, through the publication </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6">, revealed and caused to be published, in March 1925, the article named “The Birth of The Nation”. In 1926 the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> was published, by which the Lord revealed to his people a clear vision of Satan’s organization, and in 1929 appeared the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font6"> with a more detailed expose of Satan’s organization. Since then the “spying” work has continued by those faithfully devoted to God and his kingdom. The word “spy” (according to the Hebrew) means literally “to walk along”, that is to say, tc reconnoiter. During the years above mentioned Jehovah’s witnesses, who were pictured by the two men Joshua sent to spy out the land, have done much reconnoitering in God’s service, they being sent out into the midst of Satan’s visible organization and getting in communication with the people and ascertaining what is their stand towards Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ and their attitude toward the world, as well as toward the witnesses of the Lord. As we now recount the way in which the Lord has directed his people during the past fifteen years, we can see how God pictured their course of action long ago and how he has made his people walk therein without their knowing at the time just why they were doing so. Beginning with 1919, by the help of Jehovah and Christ Jesus his faithful servants on earth have gone forth to the work, trusting entirely in the Lord and well knowing that according to his promise he who directs their paths will continue to do so and to guide and protect them; and it has made no difference to them whether or not they knew just why they were doing the work, and what it signified at the time, but all that has been necessary is for them to know that they were being guided by the Lord and hence acting according to his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAHAB</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> Obedient to the command received from Joshua the two spies went forth and ‘came unto the harlot’s house named Rahab, and lodged there’. Evidently there were no hotels available in which they might lodge and find a place to sleep and rest while they went forward in their investigations. Aside from the other conclusions, we must know that Jehovah led those two men into the house of Rahab there to make a picture or part of the prophetic drama foretelling his purpose. For this reason there is no occasion to find fault with or criticize the men, or Rahab, or anyone else in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>33</sup> The woman Rahab, because of her course of action, was a disreputable person, and for the two men to go into her house would no doubt put a test upon them; but they were obeying instructions and they were willing to go where sent. No doubt there were many harlot houses in Jericho, but Jehovah led those two men to the one on the city wall where Rahab’s house was situate, and that he did for reasons well known to him. Jehovah’s witnesses going forth to the work have been tested as to their faith in God and their willingness to obey instructions and to go to that class of persons that are less popular than others in the world, even into the places inhabited by disreputable persons, and to there carry the message to a people not of the highest reputation. As Jesus made himself of no reputation, his faithful witnesses do not stop to consider what their reputation might be. Jonah had a like test put upon him to carry the message to Nineveh. Harlots are</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE WATCHTOWER,</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">not always responsible for their course in life. No doubt the cruel “higher-ups” of the world, who put on the appearance of being reputable but who in fact, if generally known, are disreputable, have pushed many a young woman into a wrong course and forced her into a situation that is greatly humiliating. Some women who have found themselves in that situation have sincerely desired righteousness, and are much more susceptible to the hearing of the message of the kingdom and giving heed to it than are the higher-up religionists who appear to be pious and pure but who are in fact abominable in the sight of God. The pompous religious leaders, amongst the Jews, came to Jesus to make a showing of their own wisdom and piety, and they demanded of him by what authority he was working amongst the people without getting permission of the higher-ups. Those same roosters had charged Jesus with associating with publicans and sinners and harlots. Those religionists assumed to be exceedingly good and reputable, and yet Jesus said to them: ‘Publicans and harlots enter the kingdom before you.’ (Matt. 21:31) The reputation that one has amongst men may gain him nothing and may lead to his downfall, whereas one’s standing with the Lord means everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">** It appears that Rahab was used in the prophetic picture to show that those people who are of less reputation than others, that is to say, the common people, are much more inclined to believe and receive the Lord with sincerity and walk in his way than are those who are of high reputation amongst men and who have a desire to receive the favor and approval of men. Jehovah’s witnesses find that it is the common people who are most ready to hear the truth of and concerning the kingdom. It was even so when Jesus was on earth, that the common people heard him gladly, while the higher-ups opposed, rejected and persecuted him, no doubt thinking that by so doing they would make themselves more popular with their fellow creatures. Men must recognize that they need help and that their help comes, not from men, but from God through Christ Jesus, and that this help must be received before they can receive and exercise faith in God and Christ Jesus. They must have a sincere desire for a condition of righteousness. In this prophetic drama Rahab pictured that class of sincere, honest-hearted persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rahab</span><span class="font6"> is derived from the verb “to broaden”, and means either (1) “wide, broad, large, roomy”, or (2) “at large, or at liberty”. Rahab, by receiving the spies, showed she was broad-minded and not a narrow, nationalistic patrioteer or religionist, who thinks by saluting a flag or “heiling” worldly men to gain some profit. Her confession shows that her heart and mind had been widened and enlarged by the things that she had learned, but that she had fear of God. The second meaning of the name, “at liberty,” fits well the class whom Rahab pictured, who are at liberty and stand aloof from the religious fetters that have long held them in restraint or held them in prison. Rahab, therefore, pictured in this drama those honest-hearted, sincere persons of good will, the Jonadabs, who form the “great multitude”, that is, the “other sheep” of the Lord, and who are of those ‘people not desired’. (Zeph. 2:1) “And I will walk at liberty </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font6"> at large; (Hebrew) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rahab]</span><span class="font6">; for I seek thy precepts.” (Ps. 119:45) It is the habit of the ultra-religionists, sanctimonious ones, to say to others: “What will the world think of you if you don’t go to church and if you go about handing out pamphlets to the common people?” To that the Rahab class of the present day respond: “We are seeking the Lord’s approval and care not what the world may say about us. We have left the world behind to obey God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>36</sup> Rahab’s house was on the wall of the city of Jericho, which appears to mean that she was quite at outs and out of touch with Jericho’s elite or important class. When the city should fall, her house’s being on the wall would put her in a very dangerous position, and only the power of God could save her. Such likewise describes the condition of the Jonadabs of the present day. Their position is dangerous, and the fall of Satan’s organization “Christendom”, which is certain to come, would mean their destruction unless those Jonadabs find protection with the Lord. Rahab had heard of the God of Israel and believed on him, and she must have discerned whom she was taking into her house when she admitted the two men. Her subsequent conversation with them shows that she did have faith in God. Likewise as Jehovah’s witnesses spy out the land in “Christendom”, the Rahab class, that is, the people of good will toward God, will discern that Jehovah’s witnesses are servants of the Most High about whom they have heard, and they desire to learn more about God and his ways and to have his protection; therefore they readily receive God’s messengers and do what they can for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SEEKING THEIR HURT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The watchmen of Jericho would know that the Israelites were encamped just across the Jordan river opposite Jericho, and when they saw two strangers in the city and going toward the house of Rahab they reported the matter to the political rulers of the city: “And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.” (Josh. 2:2) Those watchmen making the report pictured the present-day religionists of &quot;Christendom”, who act as clergymen and who are on the watch to see that no one invades their realm and exposes them and interferes with their fences that they have put around the imprisoned sheep. Instead, however, of taking some action themselves by coming boldly to the front, they report to the political rulers and induce them to take action and to do hurt or injury to the witnesses of the Lord. The repeated experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses in the land of “Christendom” exactly fit this part of the picture here made. Those religionists have not the interest of the people at heart, but are looking out for their own selfish interests and see to it that so far as within their power the people are kept in ignorance of what is being done by the religionists and that the witnesses of the Lord are kept from them and are persecuted for going about telling the people the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; The political rulers of the city acted immediately: &quot;And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house; for they be come to search out all the country.” (Josh. 2:3) Likewise today the clergy or chief religionists hope to have the political authorities to compel the Jonadabs to surrender up and testify in the court against Jehovah’s witnesses, that injury or hurt may result to Jehovah’s witnesses. For Rahab to have disobeyed the command given by the police and which had been issued at the direction of the higher officers, who were acting on the advice of the religious priests, would have been rather dangerous for Rahab. They would have charged her with harboring enemies. But Rahab would no doubt have reckoned that, if she delivered the two spies into the hands of the officers, such would have resulted in their death, and that would not have saved Jericho from falling; whereas her receiving the two spies and protecting them would show her faith in Jehovah God, from whom alone help could come to her. She had acted as Jesus has stated concerning strangers who do good unto the Lord, when he said, “I was a stranger, and ye took me in,” for the sake of God’s name and because of your good will toward God. —Matt. 25:34,35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Rahab showed her faith in God, even as the Jonadabs, or “other sheep”, today show their faith in Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ: &quot;And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were.” (Josh. 2:4) Rahab regarded the favor of God much more to be desired than to have the favor of the king of Jericho. She showed her fear of God and no fear of man. Her conduct was approved by the Lord; as it is written in the Scriptures: “Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?” (Jas. 2:25) Her faith was pleasing to the Lord, and for that reason he counted her righteous. (Heb. 11:31) Thus is shown that faith in God is the first essential to protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*° Religious commentators have taken issue with the Lord’s Word concerning Rahab. Their argument is that good morals and obedience to the law of the land required Rahab to tell the king’s police officers the state of facts, even as they existed, though it might result in the death of the two men. This shows that such critics are either ignorant of the Scriptures or else for selfish reasons make such arguments, wishing to appear as upholding good morals and the law of the land regardless of what God may say, in order that they, the preachers, may have a good reputation amongst men. Had Rahab followed the course marked out by the religionists, she would have shown her selfishness and her desire to save her own neck at the cost of the lives of two men who represented Jehovah. Instead she showed her faith in the power of the Almighty God. Rahab was not a betrayer of those who had brought her good information and advice. Likewise those who form the “great multitude” refuse to betray the messengers of the Lord into the hands of the enemy and to thereby do injury to the kingdom witness work. The true Jonadabs show their faith in God, knowing that he will bring about always what is best, and therefore they rely upon him, knowing always that if they do good unto the witnesses of the Lord they are doing good unto the Lord himself. Such faithful men appear in the eyes of others “as deceivers, and yet true” to God and his cause of righteousness.—2 Cor. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Nighttime had then fallen over the city of Jericho, because Rahab mentioned it was the “time of shutting of the gate”. She refused to lend herself to the enemies of God. Even so those of the “great multitude” refuse to render assistance to the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. Rahab used her wits and her head and aided the two men to get away, and therefore she said to the police officers that which would throw them off the track of discovery. (Verse 5) Anticipating the coming of the officers who would raid her house, she let them in without making an objection and then spoke to the officers, having concealed the spies. “But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.” (Josh. 2:6) The roofs of houses in that land were flat, and Rahab’s house being on top of the wall of the city, it raised the roof above the line of vision of the guards and of the people on other roofs. She was no idler, and this is shown by the fact that she had gathered flax and placed it on her roof, and she used that to a good purpose. “Who can find a virtuous woman! for her price is far above rubies. She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”—Prov. 31:10,13, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Likewise those of the “great multitude” are not idlers, but are industrious and fruitful. They may in the eyes of the world appear unclean and disreputable, like unto a harlot, but they are diligent and appreciate their privileges of serving Jehovah God, and hence they busy themselves in doing so as opportunity comes to them, and they serve with joy.—Rev. 7:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">** The Jonadabs, who are lovers of righteousness, see the righteous course of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, anticipating trouble will come to them because they are faithfully delivering the message of the Lord, they take precaution to arrange for the protection of Jehovah’s witnesses and they do what they can to safeguard their interests. The abundant experiences along this line by Jehovah’s witnesses fully support this conclusion. Such action on the part of the Jonadabs receives the approval of the Lord, and this is shown by what afterwards came to Rahab, and is further shown by what Jonathan did toward David when he resorted to a ruse to throw David’s enemies, his cruel persecutors, off the track. He helped David to get away from his enemies. Likewise Rahab aided the two men of the Lord’s army to escape from the enemy, and thus rendered service to the Lord’s organization. In both instances the Jonadabs are pictured, who show their faith in God and the Lord Jesus Christ by doing what they can to aid the faithful men and women who bear the message of the Lord to the people at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The police of Jericho heard the report of Rahab and immediately went forth in pursuit of the two men with the avowed purpose of doing them injury. So likewise since the Lord has begun to gather unto himself his “other sheep”, the religious leaders incite the political officers and the strong-arm squad to pursue after Jehovah’s witnesses and do them injury. What now is the proper course for the Jonadabs to pursue that they may have God’s approval? and is this pictured in the prophetic drama here recorded?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FIRST TRUMPET</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font4">N THE wondrous revelation sent to him by the Lord the apostle John saw the Lamb of God accept at the hand of Jehovah God a scroll, the Lamb’s portfolio, sealed with seven seals, and saw the Lamb open them one by one, and the events that followed the opening of each. John’s description (Rev. 8:1-6) goes on to say: “And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. . . . And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.” Since the Scriptures are written for the encouragement and comfort of God’s consecrated people, upon whom the end of the world has come (Rom. 15: 4; 1 Cor. 10:11), and since The Revelation is prophecy, and God is the interpreter of prophecy (2 Pet. 1:20,21), it is to be expected that God, by and through his deputies, or angels, and particularly his chief one, Christ Jesus, would cause his people on earth to perform certain things that would be in fulfillment of prophecy, and afterwards show those consecrated ones the application thereof for their own encouragement and comfort. Such is an act of love on God’s part; and God is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The angels proceeded with the sounding of the trumpets. The facts seem to clearly show that it was in 1922 that the first angel began to sound his trumpet and God’s consecrated people were given a part therein; and duly after eight years had elapsed the Lord was pleased (in 1930, by the publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Books One and Two) to show his people how they had some part in the fulfillment of his prophecy because they were his devoted and willing instruments. His name be praised! All honor and glory be given to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday, September 10, 1922, more than 10,000 of God’s people were assembled in international convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, U. S. A. A resolution was offered, supported by oral argument, and was unanimously adopted. That resolution was a proclamation declaring that Jehovah is God and Christ is King and that his kingdom has come. It was a challenge to the rulers of the visible part of Satan’s organization to prove that man has wisdom to rule the earth, or else admit the truth of God’s Word that peace, prosperity, life and happiness can come only through Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus. Incidentally it is mentioned that an electrical device with a large horn or trumpet, commercially called a Magnavox, for magnifying the volume of a speaker’s voice, was used to amplify the voice of the speaker and all present in that vast audience heard. Visible human creatures had to do with that message there delivered, yet, in fact, it was a message of the Lord sent through his invisible angels, because without a doubt these are clothed with authority to direct the course of earthly members of God’s organization. The said document reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“resolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“(Adopted by the International Bible Students Association in Convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, Sunday, September 10, 1922)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The International Bible Students in convention assembled deem it a duty and privilege to send this message to the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As a body of Christians consecrated to obey and follow our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we are opposed to engaging in war, revolution, anarchy, or violence in any form; and we are opposed to fraud and deception being practiced upon the people by the misrepresentation of the Word of God or otherwise. We earnestly desire peace, prosperity and the blessing of the people with life, liberty and happiness; and we hold that the only means by which this can be accomplished is by and through the reign of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the light of the Word of God, and particularly of fulfilled prophecy, we submit the following as a true statement of the facts relating to present conditions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">“1. That the rulers of earth have frequently boasted that the World War was fought to make the world safe for democracy, which claim has proved to be a delusion and a snare;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“2. That the international conferences at Paris, Washington, Genoa and The Hague, participated in by the financiers and statesmen and approved by the denominational clergy of the world, held for the purpose, as announced, of establishing peace on earth, have failed to bring forth the desired result;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“3. That all of the nations of earth are now in distress and perplexity, as the Lord foretold they would be at this time, and that the entire social and political structure is threatened with complete dissolution; and the leading statesmen and rulers of the earth, being aware of this fact and of their inability to establish peace and prosperity, are frantically calling upon the denominational churches to save the world from disaster;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“4. That it is the desire of all the nations and peoples of earth that they might dwell in peace and enjoy life, liberty and happiness;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“5. That the people are being misled by those who are attempting to bring about this desire through international conferences and agreements in the form of the League of Nations and like compacts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“We therefore call upon the nations of earth, their rulers and leaders, and upon all the clergymen of all the denominational churches of earth, their followers and allies, big business and big politicians, to bring forth their proof in justification of the position taken by them that they can establish peace and prosperity on earth and bring happiness to the people; and their failing in this, we call upon them to give ear to the testimony that we offer as witnesses for the Lord, and then let them say whether or not our testimony is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Relying upon the Word of God and his providential dealings with mankind through Christ Jesus, we as his witnesses hold and testify as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">“1. That the World War came in 1914 and was followed by great famines, pestilences and revolutions in various parts of the earth exactly as foretold by the Lord;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“2. That 1914 marked the legal ending of the old world and there Christ the rightful King took unto himself his power as king;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“3. That the Lord Jesus Christ is now present, invisible to man, and proceeding with the work of establishing his kingdom, for which kingdom he taught his followers to pray;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“4. That Satan, long the god of this world, has deceived the statesmen, financiers and the clergy, by inducing them to believe that by international agreement or other combined efforts they can bring the desire of all nations;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“5. That all of the world’s present organization constitutes the visible part of Satan’s empire or organization, and that Satan’s empire must now fall before the forward march of the King of glory;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“6. That all international conferences and all agreements or treaties resulting therefrom, including the League of Nations compact and all like compacts, must fail, because God has decreed it thus;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“7. That all efforts of the denominational church organizations, their clergy, their leaders and their allies, to save and re-establish the order of things in the earth and to bring peace and prosperity must of necessity fail, because they do not constitute any part of the kingdom of Messiah;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“8. That on the contrary, during the World War, the clergy of these various church denominations were disloyal to the Lord Jesus Christ in this, that they wrongfully united with big business and big politicians to further the World War; they preached men into the trenches and falsely and blasphemously told them that their death upon the battlefield would be counted as a part of the vicarious atonement of Jesus Christ;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“9. That they further repudiated the Lord and his kingdom and showed their disloyalty by voluntarily uniting themselves with Satan’s organization and boldly announcing to the world that the League of Nations is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, which announcement so made by them was in utter disregard of the words of Jesus and the apostles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“10. We further hold and testify that this is the day of God’s vengeance against Satan’s empire visible and invisible;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“11. That the re-establishment of the old world or [organization] is an impossibility; that the time is here for the establishment of the kingdom of God through Christ Jesus; and that all the powers and organizations that do not willingly submit to the righteous reign of the Lord will be destroyed;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“12. That if the politicians would faithfully represent the people, and big business would cease exploiting the people, and the clergy would tell the people the truth concerning God’s arrangement and the people would cease from strife, the kingdom of Messiah would be established by him without further trouble or distress; but failing thus to do, greater trouble must shortly follow;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">“13. That for this reason there is now impending and about to fall upon the nations of earth, according to the words of Christ Jesus, a great time of ‘tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be’ again, and it is this impending trouble that the rulers and mighty men of earth see coming.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“But we hold and declare that Messiah’s kingdom is the complete panacea for all the ills of humankind and will bring peace on earth and good will to men; that those who yield themselves willingly to his righteous reign now begun will be blessed with lasting peace, life, liberty and endless happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Therefore we bring to the peoples of earth God’s message of good tidings contained in the Bible, his Word of truth, and we publish to them his message of peace and everlasting salvation, to wit, that the King of glory, the Deliverer of man, is invisibly present and has begun his reign; that the old world, under the control of Satan, has ended and soon will be broken in pieces, to make way for the everlasting kingdom of righteousness now being set up, and that millions of people now living on earth, if obedient to the laws of that righteous kingdom, will continue to live and never die; and we call upon all nations, peoples, kindreds and tongues who love righteousness and hate iniquity to recognize and freely acknowledge that Jehovah is the only true God and that his beloved Son Christ Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is stated at Revelation 8: 7 that the first trumpet was followed by “hail and fire mingled with blood” being “cast upon the earth”. The symbols used are deeply significant. Hail is a phenomenon, “a sign and wonder” that glorifies the Lord and fulfills his will. (See Psalm 148: 7, 8; Exodus 9:29; Ezekiel 38:21,22.) It is cold, hard, and destnictive to lies and liars. It is such as is reserved for the time of trouble, and it smites, according to Isaiah 28:2-17; Haggai 2:17; Job 38:22,23. “Hail” causes unconsecrated men to blaspheme; so reads Revelation 16:21. “Fire” expresses God’s indignation, and is destructive, and devours before God’s armv that expresses his judgments. (Pss. 50: 3; 97 : 3; 79: 5; Joel 2:3; Luke 12:49) “Blood” poured out is symbolic of death, and pollutes and befouls those coming in contact with it. These symbols in figurative phrase describe the effects of the “proclamation” upon those of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above-mentioned “Proclamation” charged that the nations of earth had been befouled and polluted with the blood of men unrighteously shed and that the clergy who hypocritically claim to be God’s representatives are largely responsible therefor. The clergy and their allies, the resolution charged, resorted to lies, fraud and deceit to mislead and exploit the people and to misrepresent God and his kingdom. These were hard truths, and destructive of lies. The public press gave wide note of the resolution. October 31, 1922, marked the beginning of a world-wide distribution of the resolution and argument in support thereof in many languages, and upward of forty-five million copies were put in the hands of the rulers and of the people. The visible part of Satan’s organization on earth received it; and the effect the Lord described in the symbols that follow, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.” (Rev. 8:7, R.P.) The peoples of earth may properly be placed in three divisions, to wit: (1) the agricultural group; (2) the artisans, mechanics, seafaring men and other laborers; and (3) the financial, religious and political group; the last forming the ruling class. The proclamation was a challenge to the latter to bring forth their witnesses and prove their position, or admit they are liars; and their failing to do so places them in a position of disrepute and proves their counsel without value, and therefore they must admit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The third part of the trees was burnt up.” “Trees” represent the selfish, exalted and ruling group of living creatures that draw sustenance from the people and cast their shadows upon the earth. “All green grass was burnt up.” Isaiah 40:6, 7 states “the people is grass” and withered!, when the spirit of the Lord blows upon it. “Green grass” would represent the people’s hopes centered in the announced schemes and plans of the ruling class. Such are ‘burned up’, and today the people have no hope in the schemes of men</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The forty-five million copies distributed of that message of truth went a good way toward showing the people that they cannot hope for any blessings from the Devil’s organization, represented on earth by selfish men. With the earth charred, and the trees and the green grass burned, it is a desolate outlook for the Devil’s earthly organization, and this is held up before the people. The clergy warned their flocks not to read the aforesaid “Proclamation” and the accompanying literature, but their warning went unheeded.—See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> 1923, page 83.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LETTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BLESSINGS OF JEHOVAH WERE ABUNDANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank our Teachers for the privilege we had this past year to work in the field uninterrupted. By His grace we placed in the hands of the people 555 bound books and 5,012 booklets; a total of 5,567. We worked in Syria and the Sanjak. In the cities Alexandretta, Laodicea and Antioquia we found a very liberal spirit and we placed literature beyond our expectations. The blessings of our dear Father were abundant. Satan caused us to be arrested; and after we gave a good witness to the authorities about our work we were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One former attorney and his son, a judge, on our two visits provided themselves with all the Arabic books we had, getting the rest on which we were short in the French language. Also the director of the customhouse took all the books in the French language, and another businessman got all the books in the Arabic language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We visited also the two Arabian bishops, and on entering in one’s home we found him reading the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font4"> He received us kindly and provided himself with three other books. The other bishop likewise received us politely and got four bound books and a few booklets. The Orthodox clergy here are not persecutors and have not fanaticized the people. Some people visited us at home to provide themselves with literature, and these as well as others asked us to visit them at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank our Teachers for the food they provide for us and for Jonadabs, which gives us courage, faith, strength and boldness in participating in His “strange work” until every vestige of Satan’s wicked organization is destroyed and the name of the Almighty God given the proper honor and praise due to Him. —Psalm 150.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May Jehovah bless you with strength and wisdom to finish the work committed to you, is our daily prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of late years I have refrained from intruding upon your precious time; however, the article “Organization” in the June 1 and 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font4"> impels me to express in a few words to you, whose faithful service Jehovah is using, my gratitude to Jehovah for the marvelous arrangement that he has made for his visible organization, as outlined in these two </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth,” and I rejoice to see Jehovah’s name take its proper place in his visible organization. What a relief it is to see the end of “Home Rule for Happy Hollow”, including ‘women’s rights’ and other unscriptural procedure that subjected some souls to local opinions and individual judgment, instead of to the Higher Powers, thereby bringing reproach upon Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that only ‘in the recent past the Society has designated all in the organization as “servants” ’, yet I observe that for many years previous to that time you have in your correspondence with your brethren acknowledged yourself as “your brother and servant, by His grace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I delight to serve in the theocratic organization of the Most High, wherever assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praying Jehovah’s continued rich blessing upon your faithful service in this thrilling day of His battle, and with much love, I am</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REAL COMFORT AND JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some time ago two of Jehovah’s witnesses came to see me, and after talking for some time about the kingdom work, and letting me hear some of the records of your speeches, they left several of your books with me, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, The Harp of God,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font4"> Since then I have bought others; and I can say with absolute truth that they have brought me more cheer and understanding of the Bible than I ever had before. I have always been repelled by the church (of any denomination), but have felt in great need of some explanation of the Bible. This I have found in your books. I can now realize the real comfort and joy there is in the Bible, and it has altered my whole life and attitude towards people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan’s organization has certainly strained every effort in this last crisis in Europe, and Mr. Chamberlain seems to have played right into his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am getting more of your books, to give to people who are much distressed in these present times, in the hope that they may find the same comfort and cheer that I have found in them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JOY AND BLESSINGS IN SERVICE OF JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have just arrived back in France from the most marvelous of all conventions we have ever attended, in the Royal Albert Hall, London. We felt we must write you to tell you of our great joy and all the many blessings we constantly receive in the service of our great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prospect of the Jonadabs is thrilling! Brother Harbeck addressed the Paris company on Thursday evening (the hall was packed, and many were standing) and they too were delighted. They are mostly Jonadabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We went to England for our annual rest, and to attend the Birmingham convention. On hearing the wonderful news of an international convention by telephone we decided to stay in England and work there until the great event. We enjoyed the change, and must say how very much easier the work in England is compared with France. No opposition, no police trouble, and the people mostly kind and calm. It has been our privilege to work out here these past seven and a half years, and we really feel we are in a fight. What with concierges in Paris, and dogs in the country, and dodging police and gendarmes, we feel there is something wrong if all goes smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feel, too, we must say a word about the kindness and love we receive from the office here, which makes us feel happy to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now we would like to tell you that we love you very much and are with you wholeheartedly in the work Jehovah has given us to do. May Jehovah richly bless and keep you and give you strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in Jehovah’s namel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Happy and thrilled are we for the privilege of thus sharing with you and others, who really and truly serve Jehovah in this wonderful day of praise to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We arc deeply grateful to the Lord at this time for the privilege of engaging in the special pioneer branch of the service, in which the opportunity is extended in all its fullness and beauty to see and appreciate and aid those of good will to become a part of the “great multitude”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our joy and hope is increased, after studying the new organization arrangement, even now in effect throughout the earth, thus bringing perfect harmony, peace and precise activity. And now while studying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> series “Fill the Earth”, surely all of the Lord’s people rejoice for such a sweet understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured of our Christian love and best wishes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">&quot;A Baptist preacher and wife who heard Brother Rutherford’s lecture ‘Face the Facts’ stated that he had been prejudiced against Rutherford from what others said about him until he had heard for himself the broadcast over the radio, and has changed his mind. He took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches, The Harp,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font4"> and was reading them and showed quite an interest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL PIONEER, “WARNING” SERIES, AND A CATHOLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The prospects are very bright for an active company </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">here. </span><span class="font4">An </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> study has been organized in a home. The first meeting was held last Sunday, with ten in attendance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font4"> study was arranged at that time, to begin this next Saturday (December 3) at seven o’clock and to continue each Saturday night. This study is to be held at the home of a Mr.------, who until ten days ago had never</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">heard of the truth. His wife has had some of the booklets, but did not let her husband know of it. In the first call during door-to-door work, she took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and gave an appointment for a back call. After hearing the ‘Warning’ lecture series, Mr. ------ began reading the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and by the time he was halfway through his enthusiasm was great. He was reared a Catholic. During the War he and a buddy who were to go to the front on Monday went to confession and to take sacrament the preceding Saturday. A couple of hours after leaving the church he saw the ‘holy father’ who had ‘absolved them from their sins’, too drunk to stand alone. He had never been to chureh since. His wife stated that this is the first time in her twenty-nine years that she has received any light on the Bible. They plan to go out in the service Sunday. They already are telling the good news to the extent that his boss cursed him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COUNTERING A PRIEST’S FALSE CHARGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“A </span><span class="font4">Catholic priest walked into an oil station where </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">had the phonograph set up ready for action. Priest: ‘And what do you expect of this fellow after he hears the record?’ Pioneer: ‘I don’t expect anything of you.’ Priest: ‘What do you have in that bag? Do you have some of those pamphlets with you that spread religious hate?’ Pioneer: ‘Do you have any of those Catholic papers with you in which priests have stated that they would like to see Judge Rutherford’s body impaled on hot iron spikes? and another which states that he would like to use a knife to cut his throat?’ Priest:‘I doubt that. I would like to sec a copy of such a paper.’ Pioneer (taking out pencil and notebook): ‘I will see that you get a copy. Your name is------?’ At this point</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the priest declined to give his name and dropped the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASE FOLLOWS THEOCRATIC ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">zone seiwant reports: “At —-----, Oklahoma, the peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of publishers during the past two years in that company of Jehovah’s witnesses was two. Effective with the new government {according to “Organization Instructions”, issued through the Watch Tower] October 1, the interested in that vicinity were called upon and, resulting therefrom, in two months, under Jehovah’s theocratic government, that company is now reporting thirteen regular publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANOTHER ZONE SERVANT REPORTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Honest opposition to the message must not be misinterpreted as indicating the opposer is a goat; his opposition is probably due to misinformation. A publisher witnessed to a very staunch Baptist who had for years opposed the truth; today he is rejoicing in his privileges of service. This former Baptist had had the literature in his home for fifteen years before he saw the truth. Back calls and m 1 cl studies serve to awaken and stimulate interest in the millions of books and booklets hitherto unstudied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An interesting “back call”. Two publishers were riding into town. A woman was seen taking a paper out of the rural mailbox. “Wasn’t that a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower?”</span><span class="font4"> one witness asked the other. “It looked like it,” the other answered. The location of the mailbox was noted, and a call was made upon the woman later. It was found she was a subscriber for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and had all the literature and professed to being a Jonadab. She had met none of the publishers, had never been to a meeting, had not been in the service, and couldn’t explain why, except that she said she just seemed to be waiting for someone to come along. A model study was started with her and her husband. The following Sunday she went into the field and her first placement was a set of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font4"> At the next model study there were seven present—she had rounded them up herself. This is only one experience of many such where back calls and model studies are faithfully pushed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PHONOGRAPH A NECESSITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A group of us were going from house to house. I have become so accustomed to using my phonograph, I’m lost without it. It provides such an excellent means of gaining access to the homes, where conversation is much easier. Additionally, one becomes so confident in the realization that with the clear-toned message on the record one doesn’t have to fear loss of memory, lack of speech or embarrassment. The record speaks for itself. A sister stepped out of our car to call at a home. I loaned her my phonograph. I saw another single house, the last one in the territory. I stepped out; suddenly realized I hadn’t my phonograph, but thought I’d try it without. Never again! I stumbled with my words, I forgot what I wanted to say, I felt terribly embarrassed; in fact, my “trumpet gave a very uncertain sound”. Of course I made no placement and awakened no interest. As I came away from the house I realized as never before the gracious provision the Lord has made in providing the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am convinced that every publisher who has any appreciation of Jehovah’s purposes and his own great privilege as a publisher should value efficiency enough to provide himself with a phonograph. Any publisher who thinks he doesn’t need to use the phonograph is either lacking in the understanding of his responsibilities or is a self-conceited egotist. It is a proven fact that no one, without exception, can possibly improve on the phonograph presentation for house-to-house witnessing. The more one labors in the field, the more does one realize the phonograph is a necessary part of Kingdom publishers’ witnessing equipment.</span></p>

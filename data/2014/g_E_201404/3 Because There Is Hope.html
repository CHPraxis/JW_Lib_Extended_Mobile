<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class = "themeScrp">“The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PSALM 37:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible acknowledges that life is “filled with trouble.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:1-18:14:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>) Today, everyone is touched by tragedy of one sort or another. But some people feel utterly hopeless about life, as if there were no light on the horizon, no prospect for a better future. Is that how you feel? If so, be assured that the Bible offers genuine hope<wbr />—not just for you but for all humankind. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  The Bible teaches that Jehovah God intended something far better for us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Jehovah God promises to make our earth a paradise.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-25</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  The fulfillment of that promise is certain. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a> says:</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>“The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">That hope is not mere wishful thinking. Jehovah God fully purposes to bring it to reality, and he has both the power and the desire to do so. The hope that the Bible holds out is reliable, and it provides a strong answer to the question “Why go on?”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>REMEMBER THIS: </strong>Although your emotions may toss and turn like a boat on a turbulent sea, the Bible’s message of hope can be like an anchor that keeps you stabilized.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY: </strong>Start investigating what the Bible teaches about a genuine hope for the future.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Death can seem preferable to life when you feel that there is nothing you can do to improve your situation. But consider some avenues of help that are available to you.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Prayer. </strong>Prayer is not merely some psychological crutch; nor is it a last resort for desperate souls. It is real communication with Jehovah God, who cares about you. Jehovah <em>wants </em>you to tell him your concerns. In fact, the Bible urges us: “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why not talk to God in prayer today? Use his name, Jehovah, and speak from your heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>) Jehovah wants you to come to know him as a friend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:6-23:55:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> James 2:23</a>) Prayer is an avenue of communication that can become available to you anytime, anywhere.</p>
<div class="blockTxt rule"><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc">According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, “studies have consistently found that the overwhelming majority of people who die by suicide<wbr />—90% or more—<wbr />had a mental disorder at the time of their deaths. Often, however, these disorders had not been recognized, diagnosed, or adequately treated”</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>People who care. </strong>Your life matters to others<wbr />—including your family members or friends who may already have expressed concern for you. People who care also include some whom you may never have met. For example, at times in their ministry, Jehovah’s Witnesses encounter distraught people, some of whom have admitted that they were desperate for help and had considered ending their life. The door-to-door ministry has given Jehovah’s Witnesses a unique opportunity to help such people. Following Jesus’ example, Jehovah’s Witnesses care about their fellowman. They care about <em>you.<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Professional assistance. </strong>Suicidal thoughts often indicate the presence of a mood disorder, such as clinical depression. There is nothing to be ashamed of if you suffer from an emotional illness<wbr />—any more than if you suffered from a physical illness. In fact, depression has been called “the common cold of the mind.” Just about anyone can get it<wbr />—and it <em>can </em>be treated.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>REMEMBER THIS: </strong>It is usually not possible to climb out of a deep pit of depression by yourself. With a helping hand, however, you <em>can </em>succeed.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY: </strong>Seek out a reputable physician who treats mood disorders such as depression.</p>

These are staffed by people who are trained to provide assistance.</p></div>

But beneath Diana’s charming exterior lurks a crippling despair that leaves her feeling utterly worthless for days, weeks, or even months at a time. “Not a day goes by that I don’t think about dying,” she says. “I truly believe that the world would be a better place without me.”</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Diana says that she would never kill herself. Still, at times she sees little point in going on with life. “My greatest wish is to be killed in an accident,” she says. “I’ve come to view death as a friend<wbr />—not an enemy.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many people can relate to Diana’s feelings, and some of them <em>have </em>contemplated<wbr />—or attempted—<wbr />suicide. Experts point out, however, that most people who try to kill themselves do not really want to end their life; they merely want to end their suffering. In short, they believe that they have a reason to die; what they need is a reason to live.</p>

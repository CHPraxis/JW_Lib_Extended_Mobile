<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class = "themeScrp">“We are hard-pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:8-47:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 CORINTHIANS 4:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Suicide has been called “a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” As hard as it may be to believe, a distressing circumstance<wbr />—even one that seems beyond your control—<wbr />may well be temporary. In fact, it can change for the better unexpectedly.<wbr />—See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102014125/4:258-4:287">“Their Circumstances Changed.”</a></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Even if that does not happen, it is best to tackle your problems one day at a time. “Never be anxious about the next day,” Jesus said, “for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But what if your circumstance <em>cannot </em>change? For example, suppose you have a chronic illness. Or what if your despair is the result of an irreversible situation, such as the breakup of a marriage or the death of a loved one?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Even in such cases, there is something you can change: <em>your outlook on the situation. </em>By learning to accept what you cannot change, you become more likely to view things from a more positive standpoint. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:15</a>) You are also more likely to look for ways to cope with the situation rather than resort to drastic means to end it. The result? You start to take a measure of control of what seems to be an uncontrollable situation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:10-18:2:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>REMEMBER THIS: </strong>You cannot scale a mountain in a single step; however, you can take on the challenge one step at a time. The same is true of most obstacles you face, no matter how mountainlike they might seem to be.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY: </strong>Talk to someone<wbr />—perhaps a friend or a family member—<wbr />about your situation. That person may be able to help you view your situation in a more balanced way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:14-20:11:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:14</a>.</p>

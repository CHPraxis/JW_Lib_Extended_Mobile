Explaining Our Beliefs About 1914




The Scriptures encourage us to be “ready to make a defense” of our beliefs, “doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) Realistically, we may find it challenging to explain deep Bible truths, such as how we know that the Kingdom started ruling in 1914. To help us, a two-part series entitled “A Conversation With a Neighbor—When Did God’s Kingdom Begin Ruling?” has been prepared. These articles appear in the issues of The Watchtower that we are featuring in our ministry during October and November. As you examine these articles, consider the following questions regarding the approach taken by Cameron, the publisher in the scenario.



How did he . . .

           use commendation to establish common ground?—Acts 17:22.

           display humility when explaining his beliefs?—Acts 14:15.





Why was it good that he . . .

            periodically summarized before covering additional points?

            paused from time to time and asked whether the householder understood what he had explained so far?

            did not try to cover too much information in one discussion?—John 16:12.


How grateful we can be to Jehovah, our “Grand Instructor,” for teaching us how to explain deep Bible truths to those who hunger for them!—Isa. 30:20.

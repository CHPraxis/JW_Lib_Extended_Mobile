To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in November

“Please note this interesting question. [Read the first question on the back of the November 1 Watchtower.] What do you think? [Read the two paragraphs under that question and at least one of the cited scriptures.] May I return so that we can discuss why Jesus performed these resurrections and what this means for us?”



The Watchtower November 1

“Have you ever wondered why so many terrible things are happening in the world? [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why at Revelation 12:9. [Read.] However, verse 12 gives us reason for hope. [Read Revelation 12:12.] Satan’s evil influence will soon be gone. This article entitled ‘Should We Fear Satan?’ discusses how we can protect ourselves from his influence now and what will happen to Satan in the near future. Here is your copy.”



Awake! November

“Everyone wants to be happy, but many today are not. What do you think leads to real happiness? [Allow for response.] I find the Bible to be helpful in building a happy life. For example, notice this Bible principle. [Read Hebrews 13:5.] This magazine highlights four Bible-based keys to real happiness.”

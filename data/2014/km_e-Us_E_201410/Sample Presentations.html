<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Have you ever wondered why so many terrible things are happening in the world? [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>. [Read.] However, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">verse 12</a> gives us reason for hope. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>.] Satan’s evil influence will soon be gone. This article entitled ‘<a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:2014804/1-11">Should We Fear Satan?</a>’ discusses how we can protect ourselves from his influence <em>now </em>and what will happen to Satan in the near future.

[Allow for response.] I find the Bible to be helpful in building a happy life. For example, notice this Bible principle. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>.] This magazine highlights four Bible-based keys to real happiness.”</p>

Field Service Highlights




We are pleased to report that on April 14, the attendance at the Memorial was 2,610,810 in the United States branch territory. This is more than twice the number of publishers that reported in April. May we be motivated by Christ’s love to follow up on interest generated by this special event.—2 Cor. 5:14.

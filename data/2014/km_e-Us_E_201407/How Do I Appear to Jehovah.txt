How Do I Appear to Jehovah?




 1. How is the Bible like a mirror?
1 How often do you look into a mirror? Most of us do so daily because this helps us see aspects of our physical appearance that need attention. The Bible has been likened to a mirror. Reading God’s Word enables us to see our inner self, the person whom Jehovah sees. (1 Sam. 16:7; Jas. 1:22-24) God’s Word can “discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) How can reading and meditating on the Bible every day help us to see areas that we should strengthen in order to be more successful evangelizers?—Ps. 1:1-3.
 2. How can the Bible help us to make a self-examination?
2 Use the Bible as a Mirror: Bible accounts of faithful servants of Jehovah teach us what qualities are beautiful to him. For example, David demonstrated zeal for God’s name. (1 Sam. 17:45, 46) Isaiah courageously volunteered to preach in difficult territory. (Isa. 6:8, 9) Jesus’ deep love for his heavenly Father caused him to view the ministry as a source of refreshment and satisfaction rather than an unpleasant burden. (John 4:34) First-century Christians preached with zeal, relied on Jehovah, and were determined not to give up. (Acts 5:41, 42; 2 Cor. 4:1; 2 Tim. 4:17) Meditating on such examples helps us to look at ourselves with the objective of improving the quality of our sacred service.
 3. Why should we not procrastinate in making needed adjustments?
3 Act to Correct Defects: Of course, it does us no good to look in a mirror and then ignore a defect. We can ask Jehovah to help us see ourselves objectively and then to help us make needed adjustments. (Ps. 139:23, 24; Luke 11:13) Because the time left is reduced and lives are involved, we must not procrastinate about making necessary changes.—1 Cor. 7:29; 1 Tim. 4:16.
 4. What happens to the man who peers into God’s Word and acts on what he discovers?
4 A person’s inner self—what Jehovah takes note of—is far more important than his outward appearance. (1 Pet. 3:3, 4) What happens to the man who peers into God’s Word and then acts on what he discovers? He “has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.” (Jas. 1:25) Yes, we will be happy and effective ministers because we “reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah.”—2 Cor. 3:18.

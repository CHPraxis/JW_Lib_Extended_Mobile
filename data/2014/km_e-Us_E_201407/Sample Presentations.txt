Where Can We Find Answers to Life’s Big Questions?

Hand the tract to the householder so that he can see the title and say: “Hello. We are sharing in a worldwide campaign to distribute this important message. This is your copy.”
If you are leaving the tract at not-at-homes, place it out of sight and avoid folding it unnecessarily.
If the householder expresses interest or desires to talk, you might ask his opinion on the multiple-choice question on the front. Open the tract, and show him what Psalm 119:144, 160 says. Explain that the tract contains information about a Web site that can help him find satisfying answers in the Bible. Perhaps you can show him a sample by playing the video Why Study the Bible? Before you leave, point out the three questions on the back page of the tract and ask which one concerns him the most. Offer to return so that you can show him how to find the Bible’s answer to that question by using jw.org. When you return, discuss the answer by looking under BIBLE TEACHINGS > BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
If you are also distributing invitations to your regional convention, hand the householder the invitation at the same time you give him the tract and add, “In addition, we have given you an invitation to an upcoming free public event.”

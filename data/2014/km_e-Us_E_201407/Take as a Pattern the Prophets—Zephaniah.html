<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. In what setting did Zephaniah serve as a prophet, and how is he a good example for us today?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It was the mid-seventh century B.C.E., and Baal worship was being openly practiced in Judah. Bad King Amon had recently been murdered, and now young King Josiah was reigning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:33:21-14:34:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:21–34:1</a>) During that time, Jehovah raised up Zephaniah to declare His judgment message. Although Zephaniah may have been a member of Judah’s royal house, he did not water down Jehovah’s message of condemnation to Judah’s leadership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:1-36:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:1-36:3:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:1-4</a>) Similarly, we strive to imitate Zephaniah’s courage and avoid allowing family ties to impact our worship of Jehovah in a negative way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:34-40:10:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 10:34-37</a>) What message did Zephaniah declare, and with what results?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. What action must we take to be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Seek Jehovah: </strong>Only Jehovah can save individuals in the day of his anger. Thus, Zephaniah urged the people of Judah to seek Jehovah, seek righteousness, and seek meekness while time still remained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:2:2-36:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:2, 3</a>) The same is true in our day. Like Zephaniah, we encourage others to seek Jehovah, but we too must act, being determined never to “turn away from following Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:6-36:1:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:6</a>) Rather, we seek Jehovah by carefully studying his Word and by praying for his guidance. We seek righteousness by living a morally clean life. We seek meekness by cultivating a submissive attitude and by readily responding to direction from Jehovah’s organization.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. Why should we maintain a positive attitude in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Positive Results: </strong>Zephaniah’s judgment message struck a responsive chord with at least some in Judah but likely most notably with young Josiah, who started to search for Jehovah while he was still a boy. Josiah later carried out a vigorous campaign against idolatry in the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:34:2-14:34:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:2-5</a>) Today, although some Kingdom seed falls alongside the road, on rocky ground, or among the thorns, some also falls on the fine soil and yields fruit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:18-40:13:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 13:18-23</a>) We are confident that Jehovah will continue to bless our efforts as we stay busy spreading Kingdom seed.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:126:6-19:126:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 126:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we ‘keep ourselves in expectation of Jehovah’?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Some in Judah felt that Jehovah would never act. However, Jehovah assured all that his great day was near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:12-36:1:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Salvation would come only to those who took refuge in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:12-36:3:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:17-36:3:17" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 17</a>) As we ‘keep ourselves in expectation of Jehovah,’ may we find delight in serving unitedly with fellow worshippers of our great God!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:8-36:3:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:8, 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. How is the Bible like a mirror?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>How often do you look into a mirror? Most of us do so daily because this helps us see aspects of our physical appearance that need attention. The Bible has been likened to a mirror. Reading God’s Word enables us to see our inner self, the person whom Jehovah sees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:22-59:1:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:22-24</a>) God’s Word can “discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) How can reading and meditating on the Bible every day help us to see areas that we should strengthen in order to be more successful evangelizers?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How can the Bible help us to make a self-examination?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Use the Bible as a Mirror: </strong>Bible accounts of faithful servants of Jehovah teach us what qualities are beautiful to him. For example, David demonstrated zeal for God’s name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:17:45-9:17:46" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:45, 46</a>) Isaiah courageously volunteered to preach in difficult territory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:8-23:6:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8, 9</a>) Jesus’ deep love for his heavenly Father caused him to view the ministry as a source of refreshment and satisfaction rather than an unpleasant burden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:34-43:4:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) First-century Christians preached with zeal, relied on Jehovah, and were determined not to give up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:41-44:5:42" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 5:41, 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:1-47:4:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:17-55:4:17" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:17</a>) Meditating on such examples helps us to look at ourselves with the objective of improving the quality of our sacred service.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. Why should we not procrastinate in making needed adjustments?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Act to Correct Defects: </strong>Of course, it does us no good to look in a mirror and then ignore a defect. We can ask Jehovah to help us see ourselves objectively and then to help us make needed adjustments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:23-19:139:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 139:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>) Because the time left is reduced and lives are involved, we must not procrastinate about making necessary changes.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:29-46:7:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. What happens to the man who peers into God’s Word and acts on what he discovers?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>A person’s inner self<wbr />—what Jehovah takes note of—<wbr />is far more important than his outward appearance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>) What happens to the man who peers into God’s Word and then <em>acts on </em>what he discovers? He “has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 1:25</a>) Yes, we will be happy and effective ministers because we “reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:3:18-47:3:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:18</a>.</p>

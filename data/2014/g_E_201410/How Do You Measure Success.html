<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s6">            <strong>ALEX</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s6">Alex owns a business. He is honest, hardworking, and courteous. Alex’s business has flourished, and as a result, he and his family live comfortably.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s6">Cal owns a similar business, and he makes far more money than Alex. In an effort to beat the competition, though, Cal has become a workaholic and has numerous illnesses.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s6">             <strong>JANET</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s6">Janet is a middle-school student who studies diligently and loves to learn. As a result, she gets good grades.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s6">Ellen gets even better grades than Janet and is an honor-roll student<wbr />—but she cheats on tests and has little real interest in her education.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If you said that <strong>Cal </strong>and <strong>Ellen<wbr /></strong>—or <strong>all four </strong>individuals—<wbr />were successful, you might be measuring success by results only, regardless of the means by which those results were achieved.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">On the other hand, if you chose only <strong>Alex </strong>and <strong>Janet, </strong>you probably measure success by a person’s character traits and work ethic. It makes sense to do so. Consider the following examples.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">            Which is better for Janet’s <em>long-term </em>welfare<wbr />—that she get the highest grades or that she nurture a love of learning?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">            Which is better for Alex’s children<wbr />—that they have everything money can buy or that they have a father who shows that he values spending time with them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The bottom line: False success is based on image; true success is based on proper values.</p>

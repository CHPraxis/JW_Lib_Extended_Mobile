<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">A HORSE (<em>Equus caballus</em>) can gallop at a speed of up to 30 miles per hour (50 km/<wbr />h). Although this involves considerable mechanical work, relatively little energy is spent. How is this possible? The secret is in the horse’s legs.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider what occurs when a horse gallops. Elastic muscle-tendon units absorb energy when the leg steps onto the ground, and much like a spring, they return it, propelling the horse forward.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Furthermore, at a gallop the horse’s legs vibrate at high frequencies that could injure its tendons. However, the muscles in the legs act as dampers. Researchers call this structure a “highly specialized muscle-tendon design” that provides both agility and strength.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Engineers are trying to imitate the design of the horse’s legs for use in four-legged robots. However, according to the Biomimetic Robotics Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the complexity of this design cannot be easily duplicated with current materials and engineering knowledge.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did the structure of the horse’s legs come about by evolution? Or was it designed?</p>

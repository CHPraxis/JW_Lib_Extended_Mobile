<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">The veneration of images is consistently condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures, commonly known as the Old Testament</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>A COMMON CLAIM</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> According to the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>the Jews had an abundance of images associated with their worship “and these representations were honored, reverenced, and venerated.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> As examples, that encyclopedia cites the numerous engravings of fruits, flowers, and animals that adorned the temple in Jerusalem.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:6:18-11:6:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 6:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:7:36-11:7:36" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7:36</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="8" class="p8 sn"> Contrary to what the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>asserts, faithful Jews did not venerate any of the engravings or figures associated with the temple. In fact, nowhere in the Bible do we read of a faithful Israelite using an image for worship.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 class="inline" id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>A COMMON CLAIM</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="13" class="p13 sn"> “The use of images in early Christian worship cannot now be reasonably questioned,” says the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia. </em>“The Christian catacombs are veritable galleries of early Christian art. . . . Even mythological figures adorn the holy chambers of sacred worship and burial.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="14" class="p14 sn"> The oldest images found in these catacombs<wbr />—underground passages used as burial places—<wbr />date back only to the third century. That was some 200 years <em>after </em>Jesus died. Therefore, what the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>calls “early Christian worship” is not the <em>earliest </em>Christian worship<wbr />—that which was practiced by <em>first-</em>century disciples and described in the Christian Greek Scriptures, commonly known as the New Testament. The fact that such images were in the catacombs merely shows that by the third century, nominal Christians had adopted the pagan custom of using images, likely to attract converts.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>

</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">Veneration of images is a religious practice that has no support in the Bible. For that reason, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not venerate images, nor do they have religious images in their homes or in their places of worship</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>A COMMON CLAIM</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="19" class="p19 sn"> “Since the worship given to an image reaches and terminates in the person represented,” says the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>“the same type of worship due the person can be rendered to the image as representing the person.”</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="20" class="p20 sn"> When Jesus taught his followers how to pray, he did <em>not </em>tell them to use images. The very idea of using an image to worship the true God cannot be found in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="21" class="p21 sn"> “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:10</a>.</p>

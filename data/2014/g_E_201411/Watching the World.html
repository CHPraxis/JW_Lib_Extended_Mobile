<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 2007, Ecuador announced plans to fund the protection of almost 4,000 square miles (10,000 sq km) of pristine Amazon rain forest instead of drilling for oil in it. Those plans have been abandoned because of a lack of international financial support for the conservation plan. This part of the Amazon rain forest is one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world.</p>

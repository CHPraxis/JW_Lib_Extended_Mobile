<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">KING SOBHUZA II of Swaziland ruled for almost 61 years. Even though it is impressive that a man ruled for so long, there is a king who does not live for only a short time, as humans do. The Bible says that he is “the King of eternity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17</a>) One of the psalms gives us the name of this Sovereign. It says: “Jehovah is King forever and ever.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:10:16-19:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The length of time that God has been King makes his rule different from that of any human. But it is the <strong>way </strong>Jehovah rules that draws us to him. A king who ruled over Israel for 40 years praised God by saying: “Jehovah is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love. Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingship rules over everything.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:8-19:103:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 103:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:19-19:103:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19</a>) Jehovah is more than our King. He is also our loving heavenly Father. But in what way has Jehovah been a Father? How has Jehovah shown that he is still King and that he has been in control since the rebellion in Eden? The answers to these questions will draw us closer to Jehovah and strengthen our confidence in him.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Who was the first member of Jehovah’s universal family? Who were also created as God’s “sons”?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>What pleasure Jehovah must have had when he created his firstborn Son! God did not treat him like an unimportant citizen. Rather, he loved him as a Son and invited him to share in the joyful work of creating millions of perfect angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:15-51:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15-17</a>) The Bible says that these angels serve Jehovah with joy as “ministers who do his will.” Jehovah honors them by calling them his “sons.” They are part of his universal family.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:20-19:103:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 103:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Job 38:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>After creating the physical heavens and the earth, Jehovah made his universal family larger. How? After he prepared the earth as a beautiful home, he created the first man, Adam, in His own image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26-28</a>) Because Jehovah created Adam, He expected him to be obedient. As a Father, Jehovah instructed Adam with love and kindness. He did not give Adam rules that unnecessarily limited his free will.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 2:15-17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How would the earth be filled with humans?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Unlike many human kings, Jehovah treats his servants as family. He trusts them so much that he is pleased to give them many responsibilities and the authority to do their work. For example, he assigned Adam the enjoyable and challenging job of giving the animals names. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:19-1:2:20" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2:19, 20</a>) God did not personally create every human who would live on the earth. Rather, he chose to create one perfect woman, Eve, as a wife for Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:21-1:2:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 2:21, 22</a>) Then he gave them the opportunity to fill the earth with their children. Under ideal conditions, Adam and Eve would, over time, make the whole earth a paradise. Then all humans and angels as members of Jehovah’s universal family could worship him forever. Jehovah truly showed his fatherly love by giving Adam and Eve such a wonderful hope for the future!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Sadly, Adam and Eve were not willing to accept Jehovah as their Ruler. Instead, they chose to follow Satan, an <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>angel who had rebelled against God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) The result was pain, suffering, and death for themselves and their children.

But did this mean that he had lost control and that he had given up his sovereignty over the earth? Absolutely not! Jehovah expelled Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden, and to prevent them from coming back, he assigned cherubs to guard the entrance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:23-1:3:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 3:23, 24</a>) At the same time, he showed his fatherly love. He promised that he would still have a family of faithful angels and humans and that one of Adam’s descendants would destroy Satan and remove the damage done by Adam’s sin.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In the hundreds of years that followed, some men such as Abel and Enoch chose to be loyal to Jehovah. However, most humans did not accept Jehovah as their Father and King. By the time of Noah, the earth had become “filled with violence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:11-1:6:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 6:11</a>) Did this mean that Jehovah was no longer in control of the earth? What does the Bible say?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The Bible says that Jehovah gave Noah detailed instructions to build a huge ark that would save him and his family. God also showed his love for humans when he appointed Noah to be “a preacher of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:5</a>) Noah likely invited people to repent and warned them of the coming destruction, but no one listened. For many years, Noah and his family lived in a violent and very immoral world. Jehovah, as a loving Father, protected and guided those eight loyal people. When Jehovah brought the Flood, he removed the rebellious humans and wicked angels and showed that he was definitely in control.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:7:17-1:7:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 7:17-24</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>After Noah and his family came out of the ark, they must have been very grateful to Jehovah for his care and protection. Immediately, Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices to worship Jehovah. God blessed Noah’s family and told them to “be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:8:20-1:9:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 8:20–9:1</a>) Again, mankind had an opportunity to unite in worship to Jehovah and to fill the earth.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>However, people were still imperfect after the Flood. They still had to live with the invisible influence of Satan and the demons. Soon, people were again rebelling against Jehovah’s loving rule. One person who opposed Jehovah was Noah’s great-grandson Nimrod. Nimrod was “a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.” He built large cities, such as Babel, and made himself king “in the land of Shinar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:10:8-1:10:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 10:8-12</a>) What would Jehovah do about this rebel king? How would Jehovah react to Nimrod’s efforts to oppose God’s will? God confused the people’s language so that Nimrod’s followers would scatter all over the world. Wherever they went they brought their false religion and their way of human rule with them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:11:1-1:11:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 11:1-9</a>.</p>

One of them was Abraham. He had a comfortable home in the city of Ur, yet he obeyed Jehovah, left the city, and lived in tents for many years.

Instead, it was Jehovah who protected Abraham and his family. The psalmist wrote about Jehovah’s fatherly protection: “[God] did not allow any man to oppress them, but on their account he reproved kings.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:105:13-19:105:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 105:13, 14</a>) Because he was loyal to his friend, Jehovah promised Abraham: “Kings will come from you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:6-1:17:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> James 2:23</a>.</p>

Did this mean that Jehovah would not fulfill his promise or that he had given up his sovereignty over the earth? No! At his chosen time, Jehovah proved his power and showed that he had much more authority than stubborn Pharaoh. The Israelites put their faith in Jehovah, and he freed them in a wonderful way by leading them through the Red Sea. Clearly, Jehovah was still the ruler of the universe, and as a Father who cares for his children, he used his great power to protect his people.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:14:13-2:14:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 14:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:33:5-5:33:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>) However, for the Israelites, it was not enough to have Jehovah as their invisible Ruler. About 400 years after leaving Egypt, they asked God to give them a human king, just as the pagan nations around them had. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:8:5-9:8:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Samuel 8:5</a>) Even so, during the reign of David, it became very clear that Jehovah was still King.</p>

Jehovah <strong>became </strong>King when he selected David to represent him. Understanding how Jehovah becomes King is very important. Before David died, Jehovah promised him that his rule would continue forever: “I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:7:12-10:7:13" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:12, 13</a>) This promise came true when the “offspring,” or son, of David appeared more than 1,000 years later.

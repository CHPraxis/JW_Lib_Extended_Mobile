▪  Making Wise Choices During Youth
▪  Serving Jehovah Before the Days of Distress Come
What will I do with my life? This is a very important question for anyone who has decided to serve Jehovah. First, we will discuss what options young Christians have if they want to serve Jehovah with all their heart. Then, we will discuss what unique opportunities are available to older Christians who want to serve Jehovah more fully.

▪  “Let Your Kingdom Come”—But When?
Today, many people do not believe that the end is near because they do not see the meaning of world events and are distracted by daily life. This article discusses three reasons why we can be confident that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to this wicked world.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">IN THE spring of the year 31 on a mountain close to the town of Capernaum, Jesus Christ taught his followers to pray: “Let your Kingdom come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) Today, many doubt if the Kingdom will ever come. However, we are confident that Jehovah will answer our prayers for his Kingdom to come.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah will use the Kingdom to unite his family in heaven and on earth. Jehovah’s purpose will be fulfilled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>) The exciting events of the last 100 years prove that Jehovah is already King and that he is doing wonderful things for the millions of his servants.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>About 20 years before 1900, God’s servants began to understand a prophecy that was written by Daniel over 2,500 years ago: “In the days of those kings the God <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) For more than 20 years, the Bible Students preached that 1914 would be a very important year. Many people at that time were very optimistic about the future. One writer says: “The world of 1914 was full of hope and promise.” However, later that year, World War I began, and Bible prophecy came true. The food shortages, earthquakes, diseases, and other Bible prophecies that were fulfilled proved that Jesus Christ began ruling in heaven as King of God’s Kingdom in 1914.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) By enthroning his Son as the Messianic King, Jehovah had become King in a new way.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The first thing that God’s new King did was to fight a war against his Father’s main enemy, Satan. Jesus and his angels threw the Devil and all his demons out of heaven. This brought great joy in heaven but brought more suffering than ever before on earth. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:7-66:12:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 12:7-9,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>After that, the King began to refine, teach, and organize his servants on earth to do God’s will. Let us see how their obedience to Jesus’ direction sets a good example for us today.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What cleansing happened between 1914 and the beginning of 1919?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>After Jesus cleansed the heavens of the bad influence of Satan and his demons, Jehovah had Jesus inspect and refine his followers here on earth. The prophet Malachi described this as a cleansing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:1-39:3:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Malachi 3:1-3</a>) History shows that this cleansing happened between 1914 and the beginning of 1919.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.) If we want to be a part of Jehovah’s universal family, we must be clean, or holy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>) We must keep our worship clean from the contamination of false religion or politics.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How is spiritual food provided, and why is this food so important?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jesus then used his authority as King to appoint a “faithful and discreet slave.” This slave would regularly provide good spiritual food to all those who are part of the “one flock” under Jesus’ care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) Since 1919, a small group of anointed brothers have loyally handled the important responsibility of feeding the “domestics.” The faithful and discreet slave provides us with an abundance of spiritual food so that we can grow in our faith. It makes us even more determined to keep our worship, our actions, and our thinking, <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>as well as our bodies, clean according to God’s standards. This spiritual food also educates us and prepares us to work hard in the most important assignment on earth, the preaching work. Do you regularly partake of this spiritual food?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Jesus began his ministry on earth, he said: “I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) For three and a half years, this ministry was the most important work in Jesus’ life. He taught his disciples: “As you go, preach, saying: ‘The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 10:7</a>) After his resurrection, Jesus foretold that his followers would take this message “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) He promised them that he would personally support this vital work until the end of this system.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did the King motivate his followers on earth to preach?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>By 1919, the “good news of the Kingdom” included a new meaning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) The King was ruling in heaven, and he had gathered a small group of cleansed followers on earth. This group eagerly obeyed Jesus’ clear command to preach in all the earth the good news that God’s Kingdom was ruling in heaven! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) For example, in September 1922, close to 20,000 supporters of the Kingdom were at the international convention in Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A. Imagine how excited they must have been when Brother Rutherford gave the talk “The Kingdom” and declared: “Behold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom.” The next day, two thousand of them went out in the field service, and some even traveled as far away as 72 kilometers <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>(45 miles) from the convention site to preach. One brother said: “Never will I forget the call to advertise the Kingdom and the zeal of the assembled throng!” Many others felt the same way.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) What schools train us for the ministry? (b) How have you personally benefited from this training?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>By 1922, there were more than 17,000 publishers preaching in 58 lands around the world. However, they needed training. In the first century, the chosen King gave his disciples clear instructions about what, where, and how to preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:5-40:10:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 10:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:1-42:9:6" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Luke 9:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:1-42:10:11" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:1-11</a>) In a similar way today, Jesus makes sure that all who preach get instructions and have the tools they need to be good teachers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:17-55:3:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:17</a>) Jesus is using the Christian congregation to train his followers for the ministry. One way he trains them is by using the Theocratic Ministry School in the more than 111,000 congregations worldwide. This school is instructing more than seven million publishers how to preach and teach in a way that will help “people of all sorts.”<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:9:20-46:9:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 9:20-23</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>There are also additional Bible schools to train congregation elders, pioneers, single brothers, Christian couples, Branch Committee members and their wives, traveling overseers and their wives, and missionaries.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (See footnote.) The students of one class of the Bible School for Christian Couples said with appreciation: “The specialized training we received has deepened our love for Jehovah and has better equipped us to help others.”</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How has it been possible for Jesus’ followers to continue preaching despite Satan’s attacks?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The enemy Satan sees all these great efforts to preach and teach the good news. He wants to stop the preaching work and will use any way he can to attack the Kingdom message and those who preach it. But Satan’s attacks will not succeed. Jehovah has put his Son “far above every government and authority and power and lordship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:20-49:1:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>) As King, Jesus uses his authority to protect and guide his disciples to make sure that his Father’s will is done.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> (See footnote.)

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Ever since Jesus began ruling in 1914, he has refined the way God’s servants are organized to do his Father’s will. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:17-23:60:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 60:17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In 1919, a service director was appointed in each congregation to take the lead in the preaching work. In 1927, the congregations began preaching regularly on Sundays. In 1931, Jehovah’s servants began using the name Jehovah’s Witnesses, which motivated them to do even more in the Kingdom work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12</a>) Starting in 1938, those taking the lead in the congregation were no longer elected by vote. Instead, they were appointed. In 1972, the responsibility of overseeing the congregation was given to a group of elders instead of to only one brother. All who qualified to be elders and ministerial servants were encouraged to be willing to help shepherd the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:2</a>) In 1976, the Governing Body was organized into six committees to supervise the Kingdom work worldwide.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How have you been affected by what the Messianic King has accomplished during his rule?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Think of how much the Messianic King has accomplished during the first 100 years of his rule. He has cleansed a group of people to represent Jehovah. He has directed the preaching of the good news in 239 lands and has taught millions to worship Jehovah. He has united more than seven million loyal followers who are willing to give of themselves to do his Father’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>) Jehovah has used the Messianic Kingdom to do truly amazing things.

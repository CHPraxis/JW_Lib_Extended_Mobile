<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>Did Jehovah predestinate the path of human history? Explain.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Originally, the Messianic Kingdom was not part of Jehovah’s purpose. Why not? Because Jehovah did not predestinate the path of human history; after all, he created humans with free will. Thus, he told Adam and Eve his purpose for mankind, stating: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) Jehovah also required that they respect his standards of good and bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:16, 17</a>) Adam and Eve could have chosen to remain loyal. If they and their descendants had done so, we would not need the Kingdom ruled by Christ to fulfill God’s purpose. Right now, the globe would be teeming with perfect people, all worshipping Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The rebellion of Satan, Adam, and Eve did not cause Jehovah to abandon his purpose to fill the earth with a perfect human family. Instead, Jehovah adapted his method of fulfilling it. His purpose is not like a train that must run on a certain track to reach its destination and can be derailed by the actions of others. Once Jehovah states his purpose, no force in the universe can prevent its fulfillment. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 55:11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If a challenge threatens to block one track, Jehovah uses another.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:14-2:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 3:14, 15</a>) When he sees <span id="page33" class="pageNum" data-no="33" data-before-text="33"></span>fit, he informs his loyal servants of the new method he will use to accomplish his purpose.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Jehovah respond to the rebellion in Eden?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In response to the rebellion in Eden, Jehovah purposed to set up the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 25:34</a>) At that dark point in human history, Jehovah began to shed light on the instrument that he would use to restore mankind and undo the hurt caused by Satan’s futile grab for power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:14-1:3:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 3:14-19</a>) Even so, Jehovah did not disclose details about the Kingdom all at once.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>With the very first prophecy, Jehovah promised that a certain “offspring” would crush the serpent. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>However, the identities of that offspring and the offspring of the serpent were not revealed at that time. In fact, Jehovah did not shed more light on such details for some 2,000 years.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why was Abraham chosen, and what key lesson do we learn from this?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Eventually, Jehovah chose Abraham as the one through whom the promised offspring would come. Abraham was chosen because he “listened to [Jehovah’s] voice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>) We learn a key lesson from that fact​—Jehovah reveals his purpose only to those who have a reverential fear of him.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 25:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>What facts about the promised offspring did Jehovah reveal to Abraham and Jacob?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>When speaking to his friend Abraham through an angel, Jehovah for the first time revealed this vital fact about the promised offspring: He would be human. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:15-1:22:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 22:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:23</a>) But how would this human crush the serpent? Who was the serpent? Later revelations would shed light on those questions.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah determined that the promised offspring would come through Abraham’s grandson Jacob, a man who displayed great faith in God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:13-1:28:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 28:13-22</a>) By means of Jacob, Jehovah disclosed that the Promised One would be a descendant of Jacob’s son Judah. Jacob prophesied that this descendant of Judah would receive a “scepter,” a rod symbolizing royal authority, and that to this one ‘the obedience of the peoples would belong.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:1-1:49:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 49:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 10</a>) With that pronouncement, Jehovah indicated that the Promised One would become a ruler, a king.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>Why did Jehovah reveal his purpose to David and Daniel?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Some 650 years after Judah’s day, Jehovah revealed more about his purpose to King David, a descendant of Judah. Jehovah described David as “a man agreeable to his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:14-9:13:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:12-9:17:12" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 17:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:22-44:13:22" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Acts 13:22</a>) Because David had a reverential fear of God, Jehovah chose to make a <span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span>covenant with him, promising him that one of his descendants would rule forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:8-10:7:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:12-10:7:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 12-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>About 500 years later, Jehovah used the prophet Daniel to disclose the exact year when this Anointed One, or Messiah, would appear on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:25-27:9:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25</a>) Jehovah considered Daniel to be “someone very precious.” Why? Because Daniel deeply respected Jehovah and served him continually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:16-27:6:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:22-27:9:23" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What was Daniel told to do, and why?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Even though Jehovah used such faithful prophets as Daniel to record dozens of details about the promised offspring, the Messiah, it was not yet Jehovah’s time for his servants to understand the full significance of what he inspired them to write. For example, after being given a vision involving the establishment of God’s Kingdom, Daniel was told to seal up the prophecy until the time appointed by Jehovah. At that future time, true knowledge would “become abundant.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. 12:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jehovah clearly identified Jesus as the promised offspring, the descendant of David who would rule as King.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:13-40:4:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 4:13-17</a>) For instance, Jesus removed any doubt about the identity of “the serpent” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:14-1:3:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 3:14, 15</a>, calling the Devil “a murderer” and “the father of the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) In the revelation that he gave to John, Jesus identified “the original serpent” as “the one called Devil and Satan.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 1:1;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> <strong>12:9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In that same revelation, Jesus showed how he​—the promised offspring—​will finally fulfill the prophecy given in Eden and crush Satan out of existence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 20:7-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>14-16. </strong>Did the first-century disciples always discern the full significance of the truths Jesus revealed? Explain.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014240/">Chapter 1</a> of this book, Jesus spoke extensively about the Kingdom. However, he did not always disclose all the details his disciples wanted to know. Even when he provided specific details, it was not until later​—sometimes many centuries later—​that followers of Christ began to discern the full significance of the truths their Master had revealed. Consider some examples.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>In 33 C.E., Jesus made it clearly known that the corulers who would assist the King of God’s Kingdom would be taken from the earth and raised to life as spirit creatures in heaven. His disciples, though, did not immediately understand this revelation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:18-27:7:18" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Dan. 7:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:2-43:14:5" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> John 14:2-5</a>) In that same year, Jesus indicated by means of illustrations that <span id="page36" class="pageNum" data-no="36" data-before-text="36"></span>the Kingdom would not be established until a long time after he ascended to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 25:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:19-40:25:19" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:11-42:19:12" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Luke 19:11, 12</a>) The disciples did not comprehend this vital point and later asked the resurrected Jesus: “Are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” Jesus, however, chose not to reveal any more details at that time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:6-44:1:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 1:6, 7</a>) Jesus also taught that there would be “other sheep,” who would not be part of the “little flock” of his corulers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Luke 12:32</a>) Followers of Christ did not properly understand the identity of those two groups until well after the Kingdom was established in 1914.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Jesus could have told his disciples many things while with them on earth, but he knew that they were not able to bear them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>) Without a doubt, much knowledge about the Kingdom was revealed in the first century.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Jehovah promised Daniel that during “the time of the end,” many would “rove about, and the true knowledge” of God’s purpose would become abundant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Dan. 12:4</a>) Those who want that knowledge must work hard to gain it. One reference work says that a form of the Hebrew verb “rove about” conveys the idea of someone examining a book very carefully and thoroughly. No matter how thoroughly we examine the Bible, though, we cannot properly understand truths about the Kingdom unless Jehovah grants us that privilege.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:11-40:13:11" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 13:11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

As <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014243/">Chapters 4</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014244/">5</a> of this book will show, over the past 100 years, God’s people have had to adjust their understanding on a number of occasions. Does that fact mean that they do not have Jehovah’s backing? On the contrary! He supports them. Why? Because those who fear Jehovah have displayed two qualities that he loves​—faith and humility. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Jas. 4:6</a>) Jehovah’s servants have faith that all the promises in God’s Word will come true. They show humility when they admit that they misunderstood exactly how those promises would be fulfilled. That humble attitude is reflected in the March 1, 1925, issue of <em>The Watch Tower, </em>which said: “We know that the Lord is his own interpreter, that he will interpret his Word to his people in his own good way and in his own due time.”</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>When the Kingdom was established in 1914, God’s people had only partial knowledge of how prophecies relating to the Kingdom would be carried out.

Over the years, the wisdom of another statement made in <em>The Watch Tower </em>quoted in the preceding paragraph has become apparent. The article stated: “It seems to be a safe rule to follow, that prophecy can not be understood by us until it is fulfilled or in the course of fulfillment.” Now that we are deep into the time of the end, many Kingdom prophecies have been and are being fulfilled. Because God’s people are humble and willing to be corrected, Jehovah has allowed our <span id="page38" class="pageNum" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>understanding of his purpose to become more complete. True knowledge has become abundant!</p>

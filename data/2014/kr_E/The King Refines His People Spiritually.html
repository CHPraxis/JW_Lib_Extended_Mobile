<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>1-3. </strong>What did Jesus do when he found that the temple was being polluted?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb">JESUS had great respect for the temple in Jerusalem because he knew what it stood for. The temple had long been the center of true worship on earth. But that worship​—the worship of the holy God, Jehovah—​must be clean and pure. Imagine, then, how Jesus felt when he came to the temple on Nisan 10, 33 C.E., and found that it was being polluted. What was happening?​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:12-40:21:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 21:12, 13</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the Court of the Gentiles, greedy merchants and money changers were taking unfair advantage of the worshippers who came to present offerings to Jehovah.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Jesus “threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:7-16:13:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:7-9</a>.) He denounced those selfish men for turning his Father’s house into “a cave of robbers.” Jesus thereby showed his respect for the temple and what it represented. The worship of his Father had to be kept clean!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Centuries later, after he was installed as Messianic King, Jesus again cleansed a temple​—one that involves all today who want to worship Jehovah acceptably. What temple did he then cleanse?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>(a) How were Jesus’ anointed followers refined and cleansed from 1914 to early 1919? (b) Was that the end of the refining and cleansing for God’s people? Explain.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014241/">Chapter 2</a> of this publication, after being enthroned in 1914, Jesus came with his Father to inspect the <em>spiritual </em>temple​—the arrangement for pure worship.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> As a result of that inspection, the King saw that anointed Christians, “the sons of Levi,” needed some refining and cleansing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:1-39:3:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mal. 3:1-3</a>) From 1914 to early 1919, the Refiner, Jehovah, allowed his people to go through various trials and hardships that served to refine and cleanse them. Happily, those anointed ones emerged from the fiery tests in a cleaner condition, eager to show their support for the Messianic King!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page101" class="pageNum" data-no="101" data-before-text="101"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Was that the end of the refining and cleansing for God’s people? No. Throughout the last days, Jehovah by means of the Messianic King has continued to help his followers to be clean so that they might remain in the spiritual temple. In the next two chapters, we will see how he has refined them morally and organizationally. First, though, let us discuss <em>spiritual </em>cleansing. It is faith-strengthening to consider what Jesus has done​—both in clearly recognizable ways and behind the scenes—​to help his followers to be spiritually clean.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>“Keep Yourselves Clean”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How do Jehovah’s commands to the Jewish exiles help us to understand what spiritual cleanness involves?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>What is spiritual cleanness? To answer that, let us examine the words that Jehovah spoke to Jewish exiles as they were about to leave Babylon in the sixth century B.C.E. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 52:11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Those exiles were returning home to Jerusalem primarily to rebuild the temple and restore true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:2-15:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 1:2-4</a>) Jehovah wanted his people to leave behind all traces of Babylon’s religion. Notice that he gave them a series of commands: “Touch nothing unclean,” “get out from the midst of her,” and “keep yourselves clean.” Jehovah’s pure worship must not be tainted by false worship. What, then, may we conclude? Spiritual cleanness involves keeping free of the teachings and practices of false religion.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Through what channel has Jesus helped his followers to be spiritually clean?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Shortly after he was installed as King, Jesus put in place a clearly recognizable channel through which he has helped his followers to be spiritually clean. That channel is the faithful and discreet slave, which Christ appointed in 1919. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) By that year, the Bible Students had already cleansed themselves of many false religious teachings. Still, they needed some further cleansing spiritually. Through his faithful slave, Christ has gradually enlightened his followers about various observances and practices that they needed to abandon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>) Let us consider some examples of this.</p>

<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Should Christians Celebrate Christmas?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What had the Bible Students long acknowledged about Christmas, yet what did they not see clearly?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The Bible Students long acknowledged that Christmas has pagan roots and that Jesus was not born on December 25. <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>of December 1881 stated: “Millions were brought into the church from Paganism. But the <em>change </em>was mostly in <em>name, </em>for the pagan priests became christian priests and the pagan holidays came to be called by christian names​—Christmas being one of these holidays.” In 1883, under the title “When Was Jesus Born?” the <span id="page102" class="pageNum" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span><em>Watch Tower </em>reasoned that Jesus was born about the beginning of October.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Yet, the Bible Students did not at the time clearly see the need to stop celebrating Christmas. It continued to be celebrated even by members of the Brooklyn Bethel family. After 1926, however, things began to change. Why?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What did the Bible Students come to realize about Christmas?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>As a result of careful, closer scrutiny of the subject, the Bible Students came to realize that the origin of Christmas and the practices associated with it actually dishonor God. The article “The Origin of Christmas,” in <em>The Golden Age </em>of December 14, 1927, noted that Christmas is a pagan celebration, focuses on pleasures, and involves idol worship. The article made it clear that the celebration was not ordered by Christ and concluded with this pointed statement about Christmas: “The fact that the world, the flesh, and the Devil are in favor of its perpetuation and observance . . . is a final and conclusive argument against its celebration by those who are dedicated wholly to the service of Jehovah.” Not surprisingly, the Bethel family did not celebrate Christmas that December​—or ever again!</p>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div id="p57" data-pid="57" class="boxTtl rule"><div><strong>“CHRISTMAS, ITS ORIGIN AND PURPOSE”</strong></div></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">IN December 1928, Brother Richard H. Barber (circled at left) delivered a powerful radio discourse on the subject of Christmas. The content of that discourse was published in <em>The Golden Age </em>of December 12, 1928, under the title “Christmas, Its Origin and Purpose.” Among the statements in the discourse were the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="su">            “Satan . . . has taught the people to give more prominence to the <em>birth </em>of the <em>babe </em>Jesus than to the <em>death </em>of the <em>man </em>Jesus, in order to hide the importance of the <em>ransom.”</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="su">            “Every one is aware of the spirit of frivolity, debauchery, drunkenness and revelry so prevalent during the Christmas season . . . Surely none of these things honor either Jehovah God or His Son.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="su">            “The Devil has now succeeded in grafting his counterfeit festivals, feast days, fast days and holy days upon the church . . . The Devil has succeeded in getting the people to adopt all his wicked schemes and to give them the name Christian, in order that thus he might mock the great Jehovah God.”</p>

How did God’s people respond to the clear direction from headquarters? Recalling when he and his family stopped celebrating Christmas, Brother Charles Brandlein said: “Did we mind putting those pagan things away? Absolutely not! . . . It was just like taking a soiled garment off and throwing it away.” Reflecting a similar spirit, Brother Henry A. Cantwell, who later served as a traveling overseer, recalled: “We were pleased that we were able to give up something to prove our love for Jehovah.” Christ’s loyal followers were willing to make the needed changes and have no part in a celebration that stemmed from unclean worship.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>For many years, the Bible Students viewed the cross as an acceptable symbol of Christianity. They certainly did not feel that the cross should be worshipped, for they <span id="page104" class="pageNum" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>understood that idolatry is wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:21</a>) As early as 1883, the <em>Watch Tower </em>frankly stated that “all idolatry is an abomination to God.” Yet, at first, the Bible Students saw no objection to what they thought were appropriate uses of the cross. For example, they proudly wore a cross-and-crown pin as an identifying badge. To them it signified that if they proved faithful to death, they would receive the crown of life. Beginning in 1891, a cross-and-crown symbol appeared on the cover of the <em>Watch Tower.</em></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What enlightenment did Christ’s followers receive about use of the cross? (See also the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014249/70-80">Progressively Enlightened About Use of the Cross</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The Bible Students cherished the cross-and-crown emblem. Starting in the late 1920’s, however, Christ’s followers were progressively enlightened regarding the use of the cross. Reflecting on the 1928 assembly held in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., Brother Grant Suiter, who later served on the Governing Body, recalled: “At the assembly the cross-and-crown emblems were shown to be not only unnecessary but objectionable.” Over the next few years, more enlightenment followed. It was clear that the cross has no place in worship that is pure and spiritually clean.</p>

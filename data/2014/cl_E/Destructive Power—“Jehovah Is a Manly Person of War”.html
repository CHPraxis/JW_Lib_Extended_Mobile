<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">THE Israelites were trapped<wbr />—wedged between forbidding mountain cliffs and an impassable sea.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Even so, Moses apparently called out to Jehovah, and God responded: “Why do you keep crying out to me? . . .

Jehovah immediately commands his angel, and the pillar of cloud moves to Israel’s rear, perhaps spreading out like a wall and blocking the Egyptian line of attack.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why is God appropriately called “Jehovah of armies”? (b) How does divine warfare differ from human warfare?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Nearly three hundred times in the Hebrew Scriptures and twice in the Christian Greek Scriptures, God is given the title “Jehovah of armies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:1:11-9:1:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) As Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah commands a vast army of angelic forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:5:13-6:5:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joshua 5:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:22:19-11:22:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 22:19</a>) The destructive potential of this army is awesome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:37:36-23:37:36" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 37:36</a>) The destruction of humans is not pleasant to contemplate. However, we must remember that God’s wars are unlike petty human conflicts. Military and political leaders may try to attribute noble motives to their aggression. But human war invariably involves greed and selfishness.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In contrast, Jehovah is not driven by blind emotion. <span id="page60" class="pageNum" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> declares: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” God’s Word condemns unbridled rage, cruelty, and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:7-1:49:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 49:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Psalm 11:5</a>) So Jehovah never acts without reason. He uses his destructive power sparingly and as a last resort. It is as he stated through his prophet Ezekiel: “‘Do I take any delight at all in the death of someone wicked,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and not in that he should turn back from his ways and actually keep living?’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">7, 8. (a) What did Job mistakenly conclude about his sufferings? (b) How did Elihu correct Job’s thinking in this regard? (c) What lesson can we learn from Job’s experience?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Why, then, does Jehovah use destructive power? Before answering, we might call to mind the righteous man Job. Satan challenged whether Job<wbr />—really, any human—<wbr />would keep his integrity under trial. Jehovah answered that challenge by allowing Satan to test Job’s integrity. As a result, Job suffered illness, loss of wealth, and loss of his children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:1-18:2:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 1:1–2:8</a>) Unaware of the issues involved, Job mistakenly concluded that his suffering was unjust punishment from God. He asked God why He had made him a “target,” “an enemy.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:7:20-18:7:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 7:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:13:24-18:13:24" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>A young man named Elihu exposed the flaw in Job’s reasoning, saying: “You have said, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:35:2-18:35:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 35:2</a>) Yes, it is unwise to think that we know better than God or to assume that he has behaved unfairly. “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly,” Elihu declared. Later, he said: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power, and justice and abundance of righteousness he will not belittle.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:34:10-18:34:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 34:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:36:22-18:36:23" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 36:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 37:23</a>) We can be sure that when God fights, <span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>he has good cause for doing so. With that in mind, let us explore some of the reasons why the God of peace sometimes assumes the mantle of a warrior.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. Why does the God of peace fight?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>After praising God as “a manly person of war,” Moses declared: “Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah? Who is like you, proving yourself mighty in holiness?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:15:11-2:15:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Exodus 15:11</a>) The prophet Habakkuk similarly wrote: “You are too pure in eyes to see what is bad; and to look on trouble you are not able.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Habakkuk 1:13</a>) Although Jehovah is a God of love, he is also a God of holiness, righteousness, and justice. At times, such qualities compel him to use his destructive power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:59:15-23:59:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:15-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:18:7-42:18:7" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Luke 18:7</a>) So God does not blemish his holiness when he fights. Rather, he fights <em>because </em>he is holy.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:39:30-2:39:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Exodus 39:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. (a) When and how did the need for God to wage war first arise? (b) How only could the enmity foretold at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> be resolved, and with what benefits to righteous mankind?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Consider the situation that arose after the first human couple, Adam and Eve, rebelled against God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) Had he tolerated their unrighteousness, Jehovah would have undermined his own position as Universal Sovereign. As a righteous God, he was obliged to sentence them to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) In the first Bible prophecy, he foretold that enmity would exist between his own servants and the followers of the “serpent,” Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Genesis 3:15</a>) Ultimately, this enmity could only be resolved by the crushing of Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>) But that judgment act would result in great blessings for righteous mankind, ridding the earth of Satan’s influence and opening the way to a global paradise. <span id="page62" class="pageNum" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:28-40:19:28" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 19:28</a>) Until then, those who sided with Satan would constitute an ongoing threat to the physical and spiritual well-being of God’s people. On occasion, Jehovah would have to intervene.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. Why did God feel obliged to bring a global flood?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The Deluge of Noah’s day was a case of such intervention. Says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Genesis 6:11, 12</a>: “The earth came to be ruined in the sight of the true God and the earth became filled with violence. So God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.” Would God allow the wicked to snuff out the last vestige of morality left on earth? No. Jehovah felt obliged to bring a global deluge to rid the earth of those who were bent on violence and immorality.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. (a) What did Jehovah foretell regarding Abraham’s “seed”? (b) Why were the Amorites to be exterminated?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>It was similar with God’s judgment against the Canaanites. Jehovah revealed that out of Abraham would come a “seed” through which all the families of the earth would bless themselves. In harmony with that purpose, God decreed that Abraham’s offspring would be given the land of Canaan, a land inhabited by a people called the Amorites. How could God be justified in forcibly evicting these people from their land? Jehovah foretold that the eviction would not come for some 400 years<wbr />—until “the error of the Amorites” had “come to completion.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Genesis 12:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:13:14-1:13:15" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 13:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:15:13-1:15:13" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 15:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:15:16-1:15:16" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> 22:18</a>) During that period of time, the Amorites sank deeper and deeper into moral corruption. Canaan became a land of idolatry, bloodshed, <span id="page63" class="pageNum" data-no="63" data-before-text="63"></span>and degraded sexual practices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:24-2:23:24" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Exodus 23:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:12-2:34:13" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 34:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:33:52-4:33:52" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Numbers 33:52</a>) The inhabitants of the land even killed children in sacrificial fires. Could a holy God expose his people to such wickedness? No! He declared: “The land is unclean, and I shall bring punishment for its error upon it, and the land will vomit its inhabitants out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:21-3:18:25" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:21-25</a>) Jehovah did not kill the people indiscriminately, however.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Because Jehovah is holy, his name is holy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:22:32-3:22:32" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Leviticus 22:32</a>) Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Let your name be sanctified.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) The rebellion in Eden profaned God’s name, calling into question God’s reputation and way of ruling.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Consider, again, the Israelites. As long as they were slaves in Egypt, God’s promise to Abraham that by means of his Seed all the families of the earth would bless themselves seemed empty. But by delivering them and establishing them as a nation, Jehovah cleared his name of reproach. The prophet Daniel thus recalled in prayer: “O Jehovah our God, you . . . brought your people out from the land of Egypt by a strong hand and proceeded to make a name for yourself.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:15-27:9:15" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Daniel 9:15</a>.</p>

In a similar way, we <span id="page66" class="pageNum" data-no="66" data-before-text="66"></span>should not be repelled by God’s use of destructive power. His willingness to fight to protect us should increase our love for him. Our respect for his unlimited power should deepen as well. Thus, we can “render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:28</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20. When we read Bible accounts of divine warfare that we may not fully understand, how should we respond, and why?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Of course, the Bible does not in each case explain all the details of Jehovah’s decisions regarding divine warfare. But of this we can always be certain: Jehovah never wields destructive power in an unjust, wanton, or cruel manner. Oftentimes, considering the context of a Bible account or some background information can help us to put things into perspective. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a>) Even when we do not have all the details, simply learning more about Jehovah and meditating upon his precious qualities can help us to resolve any doubts that might arise. When we do this, we come to see that we have ample reason to trust our God, Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:34:12-18:34:12" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Job 34:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">21. While he is “a manly person of war” at times, what is Jehovah like at heart?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Although Jehovah is “a manly person of war” when the situation demands it, this does not mean that he is warlike at heart. In Ezekiel’s vision of the celestial chariot, Jehovah is pictured as being prepared to fight against his enemies. Yet, Ezekiel saw God surrounded by a rainbow<wbr />—a symbol of peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:9:13-1:9:13" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Genesis 9:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Revelation 4:3</a>) Clearly, Jehovah is calm and peaceable. “God is love,” wrote the apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="50-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) All of Jehovah’s qualities exist in perfect balance. How privileged we are, then, to be able to draw close to such a powerful yet loving God!</p>

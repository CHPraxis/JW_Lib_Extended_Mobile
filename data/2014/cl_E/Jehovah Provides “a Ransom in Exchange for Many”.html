<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">“ALL creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:22-45:8:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 8:22</a>) With those words the apostle Paul describes the pitiful state in which we find ourselves. From a human standpoint, there seems to be no way out of suffering, sin, and death. But Jehovah does not have human limitations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:23:19-4:23:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 23:19</a>) The God of justice has provided us with a way out of our distress. It is called the ransom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The ransom is Jehovah’s greatest gift to mankind. It makes possible our deliverance from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:7</a>) It is the foundation of the hope of everlasting life, whether in heaven or on a paradise earth.

<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>How the Need for a Ransom Arose</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3. (a) Why did the ransom become necessary? (b) Why could God not simply commute the death sentence on Adam’s offspring?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The ransom became necessary because of the sin of Adam. By disobeying God, Adam bequeathed to his offspring a legacy of sickness, sorrow, pain, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:20-45:8:20" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 8:20</a>) God could not yield to sentiment and simply commute the death sentence. To do so would be to ignore his own law: “The wages sin pays is death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) And were Jehovah to invalidate his own standards of justice, then universal chaos and lawlessness would reign!</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">4, 5. (a) How did Satan slander God, and why was Jehovah obliged to answer those challenges? (b) What charge did Satan make regarding Jehovah’s loyal servants?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page139" class="pageNum" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span><sup>4 </sup>As we saw in Chapter 12, the rebellion in Eden raised even greater issues. Satan cast a dark shadow across God’s good name. In effect, he accused Jehovah of being a liar and a cruel dictator who deprived his creatures of freedom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5</a>) By seemingly thwarting God’s purpose to fill the earth with righteous humans, Satan also labeled God a failure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>) Had Jehovah left these challenges unanswered, many of his intelligent creatures might well have lost a measure of confidence in his rulership.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Satan also slandered Jehovah’s loyal servants, charging that they served Him only out of selfish motives and that if placed under pressure, none would remain faithful to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:9-18:1:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11</a>) These issues were of far greater importance than the human predicament. Jehovah rightly felt obliged to answer Satan’s slanderous charges. But how could God settle these issues and also save mankind?</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Ransom<wbr />—An Equivalent</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6. What are some of the expressions used in the Bible to describe God’s means of saving mankind?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah’s solution was both supremely merciful and profoundly just<wbr />—one that no human could ever have devised. Yet, it was elegantly simple. It is variously referred to as a purchase, a reconciliation, a redemption, a propitiation, and an atonement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:49:8-19:49:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 49:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:24" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Daniel 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Galatians 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Colossians 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:2:17-58:2:17" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> Hebrews 2:17</a>) But the expression that perhaps best describes matters is the one used by Jesus himself. He said: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom [Greek, <em>lyʹtron</em>] in exchange for many.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">7, 8. (a) What does the term “ransom” mean in the Scriptures? (b) In what way does a ransom involve equivalency?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span id="page141" class="pageNum" data-no="141" data-before-text="141"></span><sup>7 </sup>What is a ransom? The Greek word used here comes from a verb meaning “to let loose, to release.” This term was used to describe money paid in exchange for the release of prisoners of war. Basically, then, a ransom can be defined as something paid to buy something back. In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word for “ransom” (<em>koʹpher</em>) comes from a verb meaning “to cover.” For example, God told Noah that he must “cover” (a form of the same word) the ark with tar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 6:14</a>) This helps us appreciate that to ransom also means to <em>cover </em>sins.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:65:3-19:65:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 65:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Significantly, the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament </em>observes that this word (<em>koʹpher</em>) “always denotes an equivalent,” or a correspondency. Thus, the cover of the ark of the covenant had a shape corresponding to the ark itself. Likewise, in order to ransom, or cover, sin, a price must be paid that fully corresponds to, or fully covers, the damage caused by the sin. God’s Law to Israel thus stated: “Soul will be for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:19:21-5:19:21" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. Why did men of faith offer up animal sacrifices, and how did Jehovah view such sacrifices?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Men of faith from Abel onward offered animal sacrifices to God. In so doing, they demonstrated their awareness of sin and of the need for redemption, and they showed their faith in God’s promised liberation through his “seed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:1-1:4:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 4:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Leviticus 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:4-58:11:4" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Hebrews 11:4</a>) Jehovah looked upon such sacrifices with favor and granted these worshipers a good standing. Nevertheless, animal offerings were, at best, a mere token. Animals could not really cover man’s sin, for they are inferior to humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:8:4-19:8:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm <span id="page142" class="pageNum" data-no="142" data-before-text="142"></span>8:4-8</a>) Hence, the Bible says: “It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>) Such sacrifices were only pictorial, or symbolic, of the true ransom sacrifice that was to come.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>“In Adam all are dying,” said the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:22-46:15:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>) The ransom thus had to involve the death of the exact equal of Adam<wbr />—a perfect human. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 5:14</a>) No other kind of creature could balance the scales of justice. Only a perfect human, someone not under the Adamic death sentence, could offer “a corresponding ransom”<wbr />—one corresponding perfectly to Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:6</a>) It would not be necessary for untold millions of individual humans to be sacrificed so as to correspond to each descendant of Adam. The apostle Paul explained: “Through <em>one man </em>[Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) And “since death is through a man,” God provided for the redemption of mankind “through a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:21-46:15:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>) How?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Jehovah arranged to have a perfect man voluntarily sacrifice his life. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>, “the wages sin pays is death.” In sacrificing his life, the ransomer would “taste death for every man.” In other words, he would pay the wage for Adam’s sin.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>To illustrate: Imagine that you live in a town where most of the residents are employed at a large factory. You and your neighbors are well paid for your labors and lead comfortable lives. That is, until the day the factory closes its doors. The reason? The factory manager turned corrupt, forcing the business into bankruptcy. Suddenly out of work, you and your neighbors are unable to pay the bills. Marriage mates, children, and creditors suffer because of that one man’s corruption. Is there a way out? Yes! A wealthy benefactor decides to intervene. He appreciates the value of the company. He also feels for its many employees and their families. So he arranges to pay off the company’s debt and reopen the factory. The cancellation of that one debt brings relief to the many employees and their families and to the creditors. Similarly, the cancellation of Adam’s debt benefits untold millions.</p>

Instead, he sent the One who could furnish the ultimate, <span id="page144" class="pageNum" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>conclusive answer to Satan’s charge against Jehovah’s servants. Yes, Jehovah made the supreme sacrifice of sending his only-begotten Son, “the one he was specially fond of.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30</a>) Willingly, God’s Son “emptied himself” of his heavenly nature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:7-50:2:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Philippians 2:7</a>) Miraculously, Jehovah transferred the life and the personality pattern of his firstborn heavenly Son to the womb of a Jewish virgin named Mary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:27-42:1:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 1:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 35</a>) As a man, he would be called Jesus.

Yes, but this does not reduce the ransom to a pointless, mechanical exchange<wbr />—like taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another. It must be appreciated that the ransom is, not a physical exchange, but a legal transaction. By providing for the payment of the ransom, even at enormous cost to himself, Jehovah affirmed his unwavering adherence to his own perfect justice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:7-1:22:8" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Genesis 22:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:11-1:22:13" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:17-58:11:17" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Hebrews 11:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> James 1:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>In the spring of 33 C.E., Jesus Christ willingly submitted to an ordeal that led to the payment of the ransom. He allowed himself to be arrested on false charges, judged guilty, and nailed to a stake of execution. Was it really necessary for Jesus to suffer so much? Yes, because the issue of the integrity of God’s servants had to be settled. Significantly, God did not allow the infant Jesus to be killed by Herod. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:13-40:2:18" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 2:13-18</a>) But when Jesus was an adult, he was able to withstand the brunt of Satan’s attacks with <span id="page145" class="pageNum" data-no="145" data-before-text="145"></span>full comprehension of the issues.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> By remaining “loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners” in spite of horrific treatment, Jesus proved with dramatic finality that Jehovah does have servants who remain faithful under trial.

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p30" data-pid="30">Adam and Eve could not have benefited from the ransom.

<div><p id="p31" data-pid="31">In order to counterbalance the sin of Adam, Jesus had to die, not as a perfect child, but as a perfect man. Remember, Adam’s sin was willful, carried out with full knowledge of the seriousness of the act and its consequences. So in order to become “the last Adam” and cover that sin, Jesus had to make a mature, knowing choice to keep his integrity to Jehovah.

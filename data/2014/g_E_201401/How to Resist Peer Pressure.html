<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">When faced with peer pressure to do wrong, try the following:</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>Weigh the consequences. </strong>Ask yourself, ‘What if I give in to the pressure and then get caught? What will my parents think of me? What will I think of myself?’<wbr />—<em>Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Galatians 6:7</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><em>“My parents ask me questions such as, ‘If you were to give in, what might happen to you?’ They help me to see how peer pressure can lead me down the wrong road.”<wbr />—Olivia.</em></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Strengthen your convictions. </strong>Ask yourself, ‘Why do I believe that this course is harmful, either to myself or to others?’<wbr />—<em>Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Hebrews 5:14</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><em>“When I was little, I would just say no or give a brief reply, but now I can give a good explanation of why I will or will not do something. I am firm in my beliefs regarding right and wrong. The answer comes from me<wbr />—not anyone else.”<wbr />—Anita.</em></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>Think about your identity. </strong>Ask yourself, ‘What kind of person do I want to be?’ Then think about the pressure you are facing and ask, ‘What would that kind of person do in this situation?’<wbr /><em>—Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>2 Corinthians 13:5</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><em>“I’m content with who I am, so I don’t care as much what others think of me. Besides, most people like being with the real me.”<wbr />—Alicia.</em></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>Think beyond the present. </strong>If you are in school, in a few years<wbr />—or even months—<wbr />the very people you are trying to impress may not even be in your life.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><em>“I looked at a school photo, and I didn’t even remember some of my classmates’ names. But when I was in school with them, their opinion mattered to me more than staying true to my beliefs. How foolish!”<wbr />—Dawn, now 22.</em></p>

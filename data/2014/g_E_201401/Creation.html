<h3 class="inline" id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sn"> God created the universe, including the earth, in the indefinite past<wbr />—“in the beginning,” as <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a> says. Modern science agrees that the universe had a beginning. A recent scientific model suggests it to be almost 14 billion years old.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">The Bible also describes six “days” of creation. However, it does not say that these were 24-hour days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>) In fact, the Bible uses the word “day” to refer to various lengths of time. For example, it calls the entire period of creation “the <em>day </em>that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>) Evidently, these “days” of creation lasted many thousands of years.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:90:4-19:90:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 90:4</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> The false ideas of creationists could lead you to dismiss the Bible altogether. On the other hand, if the Bible actually contains a credible account of creation, you stand to benefit from its storehouse of “practical wisdom.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:21-20:3:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:21</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<blockquote class="rule"><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><em>“God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds.’”<wbr />—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:24-1:1:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><em>Genesis 1:24</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sn"> God did not make life in a simple form and allow it to evolve into more complex forms. Instead, he created basic “kinds” of complex plants and animals, which then reproduced “according to their kinds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:11-1:1:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:24-1:1:24" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 24</a>) This process, which continues today, has resulted in the earth being filled with the same “kinds” of life that God originally created.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:89:11-19:89:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 89:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">The Bible does not specify how much variation can occur within a kind, as might result when animals within a kind interbreed and adapt to their environment. While some view such adaptations as a form of evolution, no new kind of life is produced. Modern research supports the idea that the basic categories of plants and animals have changed little over vast periods of time.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="12" class="p12 sn"> The Bible’s scientific accuracy in describing basic “kinds” of life strengthens its credibility in other areas, including history and prophecy.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 class="inline" id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="15" class="p15 sn"> God is the Source of infinite power, or energy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 37:23</a>) This is significant, because scientists have learned that energy can be converted into matter. The Bible says that God himself is the Source of the “vast dynamic energy” that produced the universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>) God promises to use his power to sustain his creation, for the Bible says regarding the sun, moon, and stars: “[God] keeps them established forever and ever.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:148:3-19:148:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 148:3-6</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="16" class="p16 sn"> The astronomer Allan Sandage once said: “Science cannot answer the deepest questions. As soon as you ask why is there something instead of nothing, you have gone beyond science.” Not only does the Bible explain creation in a way that harmonizes with science but it also answers questions that science cannot<wbr />—such as, What is God’s purpose for the earth and for mankind?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

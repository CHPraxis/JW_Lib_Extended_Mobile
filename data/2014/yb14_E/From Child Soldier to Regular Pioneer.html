<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I WAS 16 years old when rebel soldiers forced me to join their army. They supplied me with drugs and alcohol, and I often fought in a drug-crazed state. I fought many battles and committed terrible atrocities. This I deeply regret.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One day an elderly Witness preached at our barracks. Most people feared and despised us rebels, yet he was reaching out to help us spiritually. When he invited me to a meeting, I accepted. I don’t remember what was said at the meeting, but I clearly remember the warm welcome I received.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When the war heated up, I lost contact with the Witnesses. Then I was seriously wounded and was sent to a rebel-controlled area to recuperate. Before the war ended, I escaped to a government-controlled area and entered a program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate combatants into society.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I desperately wanted spiritual help. I attended Pentecostal meetings, but the church members called me the Satan in their midst. So I started searching for Jehovah’s Witnesses. After I found them, I began to study and attend meetings. When I confessed to my wicked deeds, the brothers read to me Jesus’ comforting words: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. . . . I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 9:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How those words touched my heart! I handed my dagger to the brother with whom I was studying the Bible, saying: “I kept this weapon for protection against reprisals. <span id="page147" class="pageNum" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>But now that I know that Jehovah and Jesus love me, I don’t want it anymore.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The brothers taught me how to read and write. Eventually, I was baptized and became a regular pioneer. Today, when I preach to former rebels, they say that they respect me for cleaning up my life. I even studied with the adjutant of my former platoon.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When I was a soldier, I fathered three boys. After learning the truth, I wanted to help them spiritually. To my delight, two of them responded! One of my sons is an unbaptized publisher, and my oldest son is now an auxiliary pioneer.</p>

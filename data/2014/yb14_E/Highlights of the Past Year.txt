Highlights of the Past Year




Jehovah gave Ezekiel a vision of a colossal celestial chariot, which represents the invisible part of Jehovah’s organization.

(Ezek. 1:15-28) Exciting developments during the past year indicate that the earthly part of Jehovah God’s organization is likewise on the move.

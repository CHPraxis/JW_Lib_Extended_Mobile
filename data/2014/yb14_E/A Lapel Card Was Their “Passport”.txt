SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA
A Lapel Card Was Their “Passport”




“IN 1987, more than 1,000 delegates attended the ‘Divine Peace’ District Convention in Guékédou, Guinea. Since the convention site was near the Sierra Leone and Liberia borders, many delegates from those countries decided to commute each day. However, they lacked the proper travel documents. So responsible brothers negotiated with the border authorities and reached an agreement. Delegates would need only one document​—their convention lapel card! When the border police saw the bright-orange cards, they immediately waved the delegates through.”​—Everett Berry, former missionary.

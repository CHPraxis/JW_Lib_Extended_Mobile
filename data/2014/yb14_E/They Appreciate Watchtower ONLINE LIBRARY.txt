HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PAST YEAR
They Appreciate Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY




On June 28, 2013, jw.org carried the announcement that Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY (WOL) had recently reached the milestone of supporting 100 languages. WOL offers research capabilities similar to Watchtower Library, which is available on CD-ROM. WOL can be used with most devices that allow access to the Internet, such as a desktop or a laptop computer, a tablet, or a smartphone. Most of the dated library material is from the year 2000 forward. In many languages the New World Translation and Insight on the Scriptures are also included. The Search feature can be used to search for a word, a phrase, or a combination of words, as can be done with Watchtower Library. Using this online library, you can look up scriptures or information in one language and then synchronize the search with another language. Here are some expressions of appreciation for this invaluable research tool:
“Thank you so much for WOL. When I saw this new study tool, I was overwhelmed with appreciation. I am not at all knowledgeable about computer programming or Web design, yet I can tell that this research tool is of excellent quality. Your love of neighbor, love for your brothers, and love for Jehovah really shines through. The design of WOL is a display of your evident care. I could not have asked for a better gift and expression of love and generosity from my heavenly Father, Jehovah. Thank you so much.”​—A., Argentina.

“I can’t believe it! This afternoon I went to WOL, and Haitian Creole was one of the new languages there. I never thought that this would happen. Obviously, from this letter you can see that I am at a loss for words. May Jehovah bless all your efforts, and may his holy spirit keep guiding you.”​—D.C., United States.

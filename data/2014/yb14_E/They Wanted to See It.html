<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN 1956, the brothers in Freetown screened the film <em>The New World Society in Action. </em>They reported:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“We rented the largest hall in Freetown and distributed 1,000 invitations. We wondered just how many would come. Half an hour before the film began, only 25 people had arrived. Over the next 15 minutes, 100 more came. Soon all 500 seats were filled. One hundred more were happy to stand. Another 500 stood outside, unable to enter. Would they wait for a second showing? ‘Yes,’ they said. And so they did, even though it was raining!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Over the years, more than 80,000 people throughout Sierra Leone turned out to see this and other remarkable films.</p>

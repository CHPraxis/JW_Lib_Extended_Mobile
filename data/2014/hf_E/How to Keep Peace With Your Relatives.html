Recognize that your mate too, as a son or a daughter, needs to give attention to his or her parents. “Love is not jealous,” so never feel threatened by the relationship your mate has with them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:26</a>.</p>

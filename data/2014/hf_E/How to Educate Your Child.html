(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:20</a>) It is your responsibility as a parent to train your child to love Jehovah and to become a responsible adult. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:1:5-55:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:15</a>) You must also learn what is in the heart of your son or daughter. Of course, your own example is very important. You can best teach Jehovah’s Word to your child if you first put it in your own heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8</a>.</p>

They must know that you are ready to listen when they need to speak. Create a peaceful environment so that they will find it easy to express themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:18-59:3:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 3:18</a>) If they think that you will be harsh or judgmental, they may not be truly open with you.

It is common for young people to exaggerate or to say things they do not really mean. “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a>) Do not be quick to get upset.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:11-20:19:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:11</a>.</p>

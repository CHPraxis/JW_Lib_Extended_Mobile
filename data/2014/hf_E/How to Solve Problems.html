<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS: </strong>“There is . . . a time to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Make sure that you spend time talking about the problem. Honestly let your mate know how you feel and what you think on the subject. Always “speak truth” with your mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:25</a>) Even when strong emotions are involved, resist the urge to fight. A calm answer can keep what should be a simple discussion from escalating into a battle.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:4-20:15:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:26:20-20:26:20" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 26:20</a>.</p>

In showing honor to one another, take the lead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 12:10</a>) How you listen is very important. Try to understand your mate’s point of view with “fellow feeling . . . and humility.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> James 1:19</a>) Do not just pretend to listen. When possible, put aside what you are doing and give your mate your full attention, or ask if you can discuss this later. If you think of your marriage mate as your teammate rather than your opponent, you will “not be quick to take offense.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>.</p>

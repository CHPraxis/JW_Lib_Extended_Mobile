<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">The birth of a baby can be both thrilling and overwhelming for a couple.

Both you and your mate will have to make adjustments to care for your baby and to preserve your marriage. How can the Bible’s advice help you to deal with these challenges?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS: </strong>“Love is patient and kind.” Also, love “does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4, 5</a>) As a new mother, you naturally focus your attention on your baby. However, your husband may begin to feel neglected, so do not forget that he too needs your attention. With patience and kindness, you can help him to feel needed and involved in caring for your child.</p>

She has new responsibilities and may be stressed, exhausted, or even depressed. At times, she may even get upset with you, but try to remain calm, because “the one slow to anger is better than a mighty man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a>) Show discernment, and give her the support she needs.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>Mothers: </strong>When your husband offers to help you with the baby, accept his help. If he does not do the task perfectly, do not criticize him, but kindly show him how to do it</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Wives, be grateful for your husband’s help and support. Your expressions of appreciation can be “a healing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:18</a>) Husbands, tell your wife how much you love and value her. Praise her for the way she cares for the family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>

As a couple, take the time to talk, commend, and listen to each other. Be unselfish when it comes to your sexual relationship. Consider your mate’s needs. The Bible says: “Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:3-46:7:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>) So discuss this subject honestly between the two of you. Your patience and understanding will strengthen your relationship.</p>

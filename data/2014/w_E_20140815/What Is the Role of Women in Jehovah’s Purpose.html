<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JEHOVAH created the earth for a purpose. He “formed it to be inhabited.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 45:18</a>) His first human creation, Adam, was perfect, and God gave him a wonderful home<wbr />—the garden of Eden. How Adam enjoyed its stately trees, its trickling streams, its frolicking animals! But he lacked something very important. Jehovah indicated what that was when he declared: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” God then caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, took one of his ribs, and “built the rib . . . into a woman.” When Adam woke up, how happy he was! “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” said Adam. “This one will be called Woman, because from man she was taken.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:18-1:2:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 2:18-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>God’s gift of a woman was unique in that she was to be the man’s perfect helper. She would also have the special privilege of bearing children. In fact, “Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:20-1:3:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:20</a>; ftn.) What an amazing gift God gave that first human couple! They had the ability to produce other perfect humans. By this means, the earth would eventually become <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>a paradise populated by perfect people who would have other living things in subjection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>(a) To be blessed by God, what did Adam and Eve need to do, but what happened? (b) What questions will we consider?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>To receive the blessings set before them, Adam and Eve would have to obey Jehovah and acknowledge his rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 2:15-17</a>) Only under those circumstances could they fulfill God’s purpose for them. Sadly, though, they were influenced by “the original serpent,” Satan, and sinned against God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Gen. 3:1-6</a>) How has this rebellion affected women?

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHAT REBELLION HAS MEANT</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Who was held responsible for the sin of the first human couple?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When called to account for his rebellion, Adam offered this lame excuse: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:12-1:3:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 3:12</a>) Adam not only failed to accept responsibility for his sin but also tried to place the blame on the woman God had given him<wbr />—and on the loving Giver! Both Adam and Eve sinned, but Adam was held responsible for their wrongdoing. Hence, the apostle Paul wrote that “through <em>one </em>man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What has been proved by God’s allowing rule independent of him to continue for a time?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The first human pair were led to think that they did not need Jehovah as their Ruler. That raised this vital question of sovereignty: Who has the right to rule? To provide an answer for all eternity, God allowed rule independent of him to continue for a time. He knew that experience would prove that rule independent of him would fail. Over the centuries, such rulership has plunged human society into one calamity after another. In the past century alone, about 100,000,000 people died in wars<wbr />—and that includes millions of innocent men, women, and children. So there already is mounting evidence that “it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>) Realizing that fact, we acknowledge Jehovah as our Ruler.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 3:5, 6</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>In many lands, how are females treated?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Both men and women have experienced mistreatment in this world that lies in the power of Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) Some of the worst atrocities have involved the abuse of women. Worldwide, about 30 percent of women report having been assaulted by a male partner. Males are favored in some societies because it is thought that they will grow up to continue the family line and care for their aging parents and grandparents. In certain lands, females are considered undesirable children, and far more baby girls than baby boys are aborted.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What kind of start did God give both men and women?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The mistreatment of women certainly does not please God. He treats women justly and respects them. Jehovah’s regard for women is evident from the fact that Eve was created perfect and with characteristics that made her, not a slave, but a wonderful complement of Adam. That is one reason why, at the end of the sixth creative day, God “saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Yes, <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>“everything” Jehovah made was “very good.” He gave both men and women a very good start!</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The behavior of men and women in general deteriorated after the rebellion in Eden, and during the past century, it has become worse than ever before. The Bible foretold that wicked conduct would prevail in “the last days.” Human wrongdoing has become so widespread that these truly are “critical times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) Throughout mankind’s history, however, the “Sovereign Lord Jehovah” has shown favor to men and women who have trusted in him, have obeyed his laws, and have submitted to him as their Ruler.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:71:5-19:71:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 71:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When God destroyed the violent ancient world by means of the Flood in the days of Noah, very few humans survived. If Noah’s brothers and sisters were still alive at that time, they too died in the floodwaters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:5:30-1:5:30" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 5:30</a>) But as many women as men survived the Deluge. The survivors were Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. They were preserved because they feared God and did his will. The billions of humans now living descended from those eight individuals who had Jehovah’s backing.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:7:7-1:7:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 7:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:20-60:3:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>Why did God-fearing wives of faithful patriarchs have Jehovah’s backing?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Years later, the God-fearing wives of faithful patriarchs also had God’s backing. That would not have been the case had they been complainers about their lot in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/65:1:16-65:1:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jude 16</a>) It is hard to imagine that serious cries of complaint would have come from the lips of Abraham’s respectful wife, Sarah, when they left the comforts of Ur and became temporary residents living in tents in another land. Instead, “Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:6-60:3:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:6</a>) Consider also Rebekah, who was a blessed gift from Jehovah and became an excellent wife. It is no surprise that her husband, Isaac, “fell in love with her, and . . . found comfort after the loss of his mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:24:67-1:24:67" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 24:67</a>) And how glad we are today that we have in our midst godly women who are like Sarah and Rebekah!</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>During their years of slavery in Egypt, the Israelites increased greatly in number, and Pharaoh decreed that all Hebrew male babies were to be destroyed at birth. However, consider the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah, who likely headed the midwife profession. Because they had reverential fear of Jehovah, they courageously refused to practice infanticide. He therefore rewarded them with their own families.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:15-2:1:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex. 1:15-21</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In the days of Israel’s judges, one woman who had God’s backing was the prophetess Deborah. She encouraged Judge Barak and played a part in helping the Israelites to rid themselves of oppression, but she foretold that glory for victory over the Canaanites would not go to Barak. Instead, it would be “into the hand of a woman” that God would give the Canaanite army chief Sisera. That is what happened when the non-Israelite <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>woman Jael killed him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:4:4-7:4:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Judg. 4:4-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:4:17-7:4:22" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 17-22</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Abigail was a noteworthy woman who lived in the 11th century B.C.E.

This angered David so much that he planned to do away with Nabal and his men. Hearing about this, Abigail took food and drink to David and his men, thereby preventing bloodshed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:25:8-9:25:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:8-18</a>) David later said to her: “Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:25:32-9:25:32" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:32</a>) After the death of Nabal, David married Abigail.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:25:37-9:25:42" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:37-42</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Somewhat before and during the first century C.E., Jehovah blessed a number of women with fine privileges. Among them was a virgin named Mary. While engaged to Joseph, she miraculously conceived a child by holy spirit. Why did God choose her to become the mother of Jesus? No doubt because she had the spiritual qualities needed to help nurture her perfect son through childhood to maturity.

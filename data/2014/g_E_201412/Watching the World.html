<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <strong>Dead Sea is shrinking </strong>at the rate of about three feet (1 m) per year. Some fear that the lake could dry up completely by the year 2050. Officials are seeking a solution. One option under study is to desalinate water from the Red Sea for human consumption and then pipe the desalination by-product, brine, into the Dead Sea. Critics fear that the scheme will harm the unique ecosystem of the Dead Sea.</p>

The company suggests that <strong>increased stress </strong>when searching for Christmas gifts and unreasonably high expectations on the part of family and friends are the principal causes.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">British scientists have announced that an Icelandic mollusk thought to be about 405 years old was actually 507 years old at its untimely death in 2006. This makes it the <strong>longest-lived animal</strong><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> on record. The clam died when researchers froze it in order to transport it to their lab.</p>

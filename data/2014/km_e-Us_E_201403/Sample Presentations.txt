For the Memorial invitation campaign

“We’re distributing an invitation to a very important event. On April 14, millions around the world will gather to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ and hear a free Bible discourse about how his death benefits us. This invitation shows the location and time of the meeting being held in our community.”



The Watchtower April 1

“We’re visiting briefly to discuss something that most people have in common. Almost everyone, regardless of his religion, has prayed. Do you think that prayers are answered by God, or do you think they just make us feel better about our problems? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says about prayer. [Read 1 John 5:14.] This magazine explains how prayer benefits us.”



Awake! April

“We’re here to provide help for a problem that is becoming all too common. Some people feel so overwhelmed by their situation in life that they have considered suicide. When a person is that distressed, do you think he really wishes to die, or do you think he just wants relief from his suffering? [Allow for response.] Here’s a Bible promise that has helped many to maintain a positive viewpoint. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] This magazine outlines three good reasons for a person to keep on living despite his present problems.”

10 min: Do Not Forget Hospitality. (Heb. 13:1, 2) Talk by an elder. Review local arrangements for the Memorial. Suggest ways that all can show hospitality to visitors and inactive publishers who will be in attendance. Have a brief two-part demonstration. First, show a publisher before the program begins welcoming someone who received an invitation during the campaign. Then, show the publisher after the program concludes making arrangements to follow up on the interest shown by the visitor.
10 min: How Did We Do? Discussion. Invite publishers to comment on how they benefited by applying points from the article “Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Responding to Potential Conversation Stoppers.” Ask the audience to relate good experiences.

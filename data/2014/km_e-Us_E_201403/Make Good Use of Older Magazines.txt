Make Good Use of Older Magazines




Since older magazines do not benefit anyone when they are stored or thrown away, we should try to place them. A single magazine can spark a person’s interest in the truth and move him to begin calling on the name of Jehovah. (Rom. 10:13, 14) The following are some suggestions for putting older magazines to good use.
When preaching in territories that are not worked frequently, perhaps you can leave one out of sight at not-at-homes.

When engaging in public witnessing where people are waiting, such as at bus stops or train stations, ask individuals if they would like something to read, show them several older issues of the magazines, and let them choose.

When visiting laundromats, nursing homes, clinics, or similar places that are within your congregation’s territory, leave a few older issues in the waiting area. It is usually good to obtain permission first from the person in charge if he or she is present. If you see a supply of magazines already there, do not leave more.

When preparing for return visits, consider the interests of each person you plan to visit. Does he have a family? Does he like to travel? Does he enjoy gardening? Look through older issues of the magazines to see if there is an article that he may enjoy reading, and show it to him when you return.

When you find an interested person at home again after making repeated attempts to contact him, show him some of the older magazines that he missed.

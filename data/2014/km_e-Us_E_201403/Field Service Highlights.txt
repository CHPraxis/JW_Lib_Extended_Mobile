We are happy to report five new peaks in regular pioneers during the month of September 2013: 208 in the Bahamas, 84 in Bermuda, 34 in the British Virgin Islands, 3,151 in Puerto Rico, and 159,659 in the United States. This represents a total increase of 5,023 over the previous peaks. How Jehovah delights when we praise him with our “whole being”!—Ps. 103:22.

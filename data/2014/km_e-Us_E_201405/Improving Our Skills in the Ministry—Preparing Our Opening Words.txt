Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Preparing Our Opening Words




Why Important: If our introduction does not arouse interest, the householder may terminate the conversation before we can give a witness. Therefore, many publishers consider their opening words to be the most important part of their presentation. Although sample presentations are provided in Our Kingdom Ministry and the Reasoning book, they do not always include a complete introduction, in order to allow for flexibility. Even if a sample presentation is complete, publishers may choose to alter it or prepare their own. Thus, we will be more effective if we carefully prepare our opening words rather than say whatever comes to mind when the householder opens the door.—Prov. 15:28.



How to Do It:
Choose your topic. It should be based on the literature you are offering and should be of interest to people in your territory.

Carefully prepare the first sentence or two that you will say after giving a customary greeting. You might start by saying: “I am here because . . . ,” “Many people are concerned about . . . ,” “I would like to get your opinion on . . . ,” or something else. Short, simple sentences usually work best. Some publishers choose to memorize their introduction.

Formulate a viewpoint question that will draw the householder into the conversation. (Matt. 17:25) Remember that he was likely thinking about other matters before you arrived, so the question should not be too difficult or put him on the spot.




Try This During the Month:
Set aside time during family worship to prepare and practice your opening words.

When in the ministry, share what you plan to say with other publishers. (Prov. 27:17) Change your introduction if it is not effective.

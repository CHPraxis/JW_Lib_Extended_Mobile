15 min: To It All the Nations Will Stream. (Isa. 2:2) Interview two publishers, one who has been in the truth for many years and one who is relatively new. What was it that interested them in the truth? What challenges did they have to overcome? What impressed them the first time they attended a congregation meeting? What do they remember about the first time they shared in the ministry? How did others in the congregation help them to make spiritual progress?
15 min: “Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Preparing Our Opening Words.” Discussion. Have a brief two-part demonstration. First show an introduction that is not well-thought-out and then one that is well-prepared. Include pertinent points from pages 215-219 of the Ministry School book as time permits.

Southeast Asia






According to the World Wildlife Fund, between 1997 and 2011, many new species of plants and animals, including the ruby-eyed pit viper (Trimeresurus rubeus), were identified in the Greater Mekong, a region that spans Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and the province of Yunnan, China. Of the species discovered in 2011 alone, there were 82 plants, 21 reptiles, 13 fish, 5 amphibians, and 5 mammals.



Europe

Human trafficking has become a serious problem in “the entire European Union,” says a report in The Moscow Times. People are sold for sexual exploitation, forced labor, and even “illegal trade in human organs.” Traffickers take advantage of poverty, unemployment, and gender inequality.

Researchers who investigated TV watching by children and adolescents concluded that excessive viewing is “associated with increased antisocial behavior in early adulthood.” Their findings, say the researchers, support the recommendation that children should watch “no more than 1 to 2 hours of quality programming per day.”



Alaska






Nearly all “Alaska Native villages” are located on coasts or near rivers, and 86 percent of these villages are affected by flooding and erosion. Reports indicate that rising temperatures are delaying the formation of protective shore ice, leaving villages more exposed to autumn storms.

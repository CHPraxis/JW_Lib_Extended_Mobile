‘Wisdom Is Calling Out’—Can You Hear It?

“Is not wisdom calling out? Is not discernment raising its voice? On the heights along the road, it takes its position at the crossroads. . . . At the entrances of the doorways, it keeps crying out loudly.”—PROVERBS 8:1-3.




WISDOM is invaluable. Without it we would make one foolish mistake after another. But where can true wisdom be found? The writer of the book of Proverbs had in mind the unmatched wisdom of our Creator. Moreover, His wisdom is available to virtually all mankind by means of a very special book, the Bible. Consider the following:
  The Bible is “the most widely distributed book in history,” says The World Book Encyclopedia. “It has been translated more times, and into more languages, than any other book.” In whole or in part, the Bible is now available in nearly 2,600 languages, making it accessible to over 90 percent of the human family.

  Wisdom also “keeps crying out loudly” in a more literal sense. At Matthew 24:14, we read: “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end [of the present world] will come.”


That “good news” is true wisdom because it points to God’s wise solution to mankind’s problems—His Kingdom. That Kingdom is a government by God that will rule over the entire earth—one world, one government. (Daniel 2:44; 7:13, 14) Hence, Jesus Christ prayed: “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.”—Matthew 6:9, 10.
Jehovah’s Witnesses count it a privilege to announce God’s Kingdom in 239 lands! Yes, wisdom—divine wisdom—really is “crying out,” even “at the entrances of the doorways.” Can you hear it?

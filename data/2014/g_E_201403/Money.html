<h3 class="inline" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="6" class="p6 sn"> “The <em>love </em>of money”<wbr />—not money itself—<wbr />causes “injurious things.” In the Bible, wealthy King Solomon identified three kinds of injurious things that often happen to people who love money. Worry: “The plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:12-21:5:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>) Dissatisfaction: “A lover of silver will never be satisfied with silver, nor a lover of wealth with income.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>) Temptation to break the law: “The one hastening to get rich will not remain innocent.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a>.</p>

<p data-pid="9" class="p9 sn"> Money makes you secure and happy.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sn"> The myth that money buys happiness and security is part of “the deceptive power of riches.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:4:19-41:4:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 4:19</a>) Still, “money answers every need.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:10:19-21:10:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>) For example, money can buy the things you need to survive<wbr />—such as food and medicine.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:3:12-53:3:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">Money also helps you to take care of your family. In fact, the Bible states: “If anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="14" class="p14 sn"> Use money in a way that has God’s approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:16:9-42:16:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 16:9</a>) It is wise to use money responsibly and honestly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>) To avoid the burden of living beyond your means, “let your way of life be free of the love of money.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">Although the Bible does not condemn debt, it warns: “The borrower is a slave to the lender.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:7-20:22:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:7</a>) Avoid impulse buying, because “all who are hasty surely head for poverty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a>) Instead, “set something aside according to [your] own means” and save money for what is important to you.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:16:2-46:16:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">The Bible encourages us to “practice giving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:38-42:6:38" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 6:38</a>) People who want to please God have good reason to be generous, because “God loves a cheerful giver.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>) Therefore, “do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:16</a>.</p>

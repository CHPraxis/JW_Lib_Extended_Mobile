In the past, the members of the nation of Israel were God’s chosen people. But they became apostate. Jehovah then created a new nation made up of Christ’s followers. They became an organization that represented Jehovah. Even though Jerusalem was destroyed in the year 70, that organization was not destroyed.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>This great crowd is made up of people from all nations.

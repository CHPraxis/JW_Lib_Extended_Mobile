<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">A COUPLE were preaching in Fiji, inviting people to the Memorial of Christ’s death. They were speaking to a woman outside her home when it began to rain. The brother and his wife gave the woman one of their umbrellas to use. The woman was so impressed that she decided to attend the Memorial. She later said that she did not remember much of what the couple told her, but she did remember the kind way they <strong>treated </strong>her. The couple had followed what is often called the Golden Rule.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What is the Golden Rule, and how can we follow it?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>What is the Golden Rule? It is the counsel Jesus gave when he said: “All things . . . that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>) How can we do that? First, ask yourself, ‘If I were the other person, how would I want to be treated?’ Second, do your best to treat the other person that way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) Explain why the Golden Rule applies to the way we treat everybody. (b) What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Was Jesus saying that we should follow the Golden Rule only with others in the congregation? No, he was talking about how we should treat everybody, including our enemies. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:27-42:6:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 6:27, 28,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <strong>31,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:35-42:6:35" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> <strong>35</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>So it is also very important to follow the rule when we preach to people, because many of them may respond well to the good news and gain “everlasting life”!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We will now discuss four questions to keep in mind when we are in the ministry. <strong>Who </strong>is the person I am talking to? <strong>Where </strong>am I talking to people? <strong>When </strong>is the best time to talk to them? <strong>How </strong>should I talk to them? As we will see, these questions can help us to understand how people would like to be treated. Then we will know the best way to talk to each person.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Every person we meet in our ministry is an <strong>individual </strong>and has his or her own background and problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:6:29-14:6:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 6:29</a>) When you talk to someone, ask yourself: ‘If I were the other person, how would I want to be treated? Would I want someone to jump to conclusions about me or judge me before he even knew me? Or would I want him to get to know me as a person?’ These questions can help us to follow the Golden Rule and treat each person as an individual.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What should we do if someone we meet in the ministry seems to be angry or rude?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For example, Christians do their best to apply the Bible’s counsel to speak always in a kind and polite way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>) But we are imperfect. Maybe we are having a bad day and we say something that we later regret. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>) When that happens, we hope the other person will understand that we are not usually like that. We would not want him to describe us as a rude person. Remembering this helps us to understand that people who are rude to us may also later regret what they say to us.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>We preach to all sorts of individuals. In the past few years, over 60 experiences have been published in the <em>Watchtower </em>series “The Bible Changes Lives.” These articles talk about people who used to be thieves, drunkards, gang members, or drug addicts. Others were politicians, religious leaders, or individuals who were only interested in their careers. Some were very immoral. But all of them heard the good news, accepted a Bible study, made changes in their lives, and came into the truth. So we should not think that people like these will never accept the Kingdom message. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 6:9-11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>“People of all sorts” can come into the truth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:9:22-46:9:22" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>We live in a world full of crime, and many householders are suspicious of strangers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) We should not do anything that makes people suspicious of us. For example, you knock on the front door of a house. If no one answers, you could be tempted to look through the window or walk around the property, searching for the householder. You may do this because you want to find as many people as possible when you are preaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) You sincerely want to help people to learn the truth about God.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How can we decide when is the best time to talk to people in our territory?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When is the best time to talk to people? Ask yourself: ‘In my territory, when are people usually at home? When will they have time to listen?’ It would be good to adjust our schedule to talk to them at those times. In some parts of the world, it is best to go <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>from house to house in the late afternoon or early evening. If that is true where you live, could you plan to talk to people during that time of the day? <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah will bless any sacrifices we make so that we can preach to people at a time that is best for them.</p>

When we find someone who listens to our message, we should give a good witness but we should not talk with him for too long. The householder may have planned to do something else that is important to him. If he says that he is busy, we can say that we will not take a lot of his time. Then we should do what we say and be brief. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 5:37</a>) When we end our conversation, it would be good to ask when would be the best time for us to visit again. Some publishers say: “I would enjoy visiting you again. Would it be best if I telephone or send you a text message before I come?” When we respect that people are busy and have their own plans, we are following Paul’s example. He did not do what was best for him, but he did what was best for “the many, so that they may be saved.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:33-46:10:33" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>.</p>

It discusses six questions that many people ask. Here is your copy.” The brother says that when they know why he is visiting them, most people seem to relax and it is easier to continue the conversation. The brother then asks the person: “Have you ever thought about any of these questions?” If the householder chooses one, the brother opens the tract and discusses what the Bible says about that question. If not, the brother selects a question and continues the conversation without embarrassing the householder. Of course, there are many ways to start a conversation. In some places, we need to follow certain customs when we greet people before we tell them why we are there.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">OUR Creator, Jehovah, does everything in an organized way. First, he created his Son, Jesus. The Bible calls Jesus “the Word” because he is God’s most important representative. It says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” He has served Jehovah in heaven for millions of years. The Bible also says about Jesus: “All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.” More than 2,000 years ago, Jehovah sent the Word to the earth as the perfect man Jesus Christ. Jesus faithfully did everything his Father asked him to do.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:1-43:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:16-51:1:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 1:16</a>) The Bible tells us that Jehovah has well-organized armies of angels. It says: “A thousand thousands kept ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 7:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:21-19:103:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Psalm 103:21</a>.</p>

How many stars are there? One newspaper, the Houston, Texas, <em>Chronicle, </em>reported that after a recent study, scientists now think that there are 300 sextillion stars in the universe. That is a 3 followed by 23 zeros! Are these stars and planets organized? Yes, groups of stars are organized into galaxies. Each galaxy contains many planets and billions or even trillions of stars. Most galaxies are then organized into groups called clusters, and these clusters are organized into larger groups called superclusters.</p>

It is vital for them to be well-organized because they have so much important work to do. For thousands of years, Jehovah has organized his people so that they could worship him faithfully.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When Jehovah created the first humans, he told them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>) Jehovah did not create millions of people all at once. Adam and Eve would have children, and their children would have children, until the human family was spread throughout the earth. God’s purpose was for them to make the whole earth into a paradise. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, this purpose was interrupted for a while. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) Most of Adam and Eve’s children did not serve Jehovah, and after some time, “Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.” Because of all this wickedness, “the earth had become ruined,” and it “was filled with violence.” Therefore, God decided to destroy all the wicked and bring a flood upon the whole earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:5-1:6:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 6:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:11-1:6:13" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 11-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:17-1:6:17" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Not everybody was destroyed in the Flood. Noah “found favor in the eyes of Jehovah” because he “was a righteous man” who “walked with the true God.” Jehovah commanded Noah to build a huge ark and gave him all the instructions he needed to do it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:8-1:6:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 6:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:14-1:6:16" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 14-16</a>) The ark was designed to float on water so that people and animals inside it would survive the Flood.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>More than 800 years after the Flood, God organized the Israelites into a nation. He organized every aspect of their lives, especially how they should worship him. For example, he assigned some of them to be priests and Levites. He also organized some women “to serve at the entrance of the tent of meeting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:38:8-2:38:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 38:8</a>) Jehovah later commanded the nation to go and live in Canaan. But most of the Israelites were afraid and refused to go, so he told them: “None of you will enter into the land that I swore to have you reside in except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.” Joshua and Caleb were the only ones who had brought back a good report after spying out the Promised Land.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:27:18-4:27:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Numbers 27:18-23</a>) Just before Joshua led them into Canaan, Jehovah told him: “Be courageous and strong.

For example, in the year 1473 before Christ, the Israelites were camped near the Canaanite city of Jericho. Joshua sent two men to spy out Jericho, where they met the prostitute Rahab. Men in the city tried to capture the spies, but Rahab hid them on the roof of her house. She told the Israelite spies: “I do know that Jehovah will give you the land . . . , for we heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you . . . and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites.” She added: “Jehovah your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:2:9-6:2:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joshua 2:9-11</a>) Rahab and her family supported Jehovah’s chosen people.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>While faithful Joshua was their leader, the Israelites were successful and conquered the land of Canaan, one city after the other. But later, over a period of about 1,500 years, the Israelites were unfaithful again and again. When Jesus came to the earth, the Israelites had become so disobedient to Jehovah and his prophets that Jesus called the Israelites living in Jerusalem “the killer of the prophets.” <strong>(Read </strong><span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:37-40:23:38" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 23:37, 38</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah rejected the Jewish religious leaders because of their disobedience.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Not long after Jesus came to the earth, Jehovah rejected the nation of Israel. But he would still have an organization of faithful servants on earth who obeyed Christ and his teachings. On the day of Pentecost in the year 33, Jehovah began to favor a new organization instead of the nation of Israel. About 120 disciples of Jesus were gathered together when “suddenly there was a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house.” Then “tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed, and one came to rest on each one of them, and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak in different languages.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4</a>) This amazing event showed without a doubt that Jehovah was supporting this new organization of Christ’s disciples.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>On that same day, about 3,000 people joined Jehovah’s new organization.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 6:7</a>) Later, when Jehovah brought people who were not Jews into the Christian congregation, it was further evidence that he supported the new organization.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:44-44:10:45" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 10:44, 45</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>There was no doubt what work God had given Christ’s followers to do. While on earth, Jesus had set the example for them.

He had warned his disciples: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near. Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, let those in the midst of her leave, and let those in the countryside not enter into her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:20-42:21:21" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 21:20, 21</a>) Exactly as Jesus had foretold, Jerusalem was destroyed. The Jews rebelled against the Romans, and in the year 66, Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem and were just about to destroy it. But the armies suddenly left, and that gave Jesus’ followers an opportunity to leave Jerusalem and Judea. Many fled across the Jordan River and went up into the mountains.

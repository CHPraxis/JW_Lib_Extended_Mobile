<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">JEHOVAH has guided his people throughout history. In the past, he used angels, visions, and dreams to reveal the future or to give specific assignments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:7:89-4:7:89" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 7:89;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:1:1-26:1:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:19-27:2:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Daniel 2:19</a>) Sometimes God selected humans to represent him and convey his direction. No matter how Jehovah’s people received his word, those who followed his instructions were blessed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Today, Jehovah uses the Bible, his holy spirit, and the congregation to guide us.

Walk in it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:30:21-23:30:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:21</a>) Jehovah also uses Jesus to convey His voice to us.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Satan tries to influence the way people think by using false information and propaganda. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 5:19</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Newspapers, books, magazines, radio, TV, and the Internet spread information over the whole earth. These sources offer some useful information, but they often promote conduct that goes against Jehovah’s standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:2:13-24:2:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:13</a>) For example, they may say that there is nothing wrong with same-sex marriage. This leads many people to feel that what the Bible says about homosexuality is too strict.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How can we avoid being influenced by Satan’s propaganda?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How can people who love Jehovah’s standards avoid being influenced by Satan’s propaganda? How can they know what is good and what is bad? The Bible answers: “By keeping on guard according to [God’s] word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:9-19:119:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 119:9</a>) God’s written Word helps us to see what is true and what is a lie. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:23:23-20:23:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:23</a>) Jesus said that we need “every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4</a>) In the Bible, Jehovah gives us principles that we need to learn to apply. For example, long before there was a written law against adultery, Joseph knew that having sexual relations with Potiphar’s wife would be a sin against God. He never even considered disobeying Jehovah. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:39:7-1:39:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 39:7-9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even though Potiphar’s wife pressured him for a long time, Joseph chose to listen to Jehovah’s voice, not to hers. Today, we too must listen to Jehovah’s voice, not to the constant noise of Satan’s propaganda.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What must we do in order to avoid Satan’s wicked advice?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The world is filled with confusing religious ideas, and many people feel that it is impossible to find the true religion. But if we are willing to listen to Jehovah, he makes the truth easy to find. We have to decide to whom we will listen. It is almost impossible to listen to two voices at the same time. Just as sheep know their shepherd’s voice, we need to know the voice of Jesus, the one whom Jehovah has chosen to shepherd us.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:3-43:10:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>John 10:3-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jesus said: “Pay attention to what you are hearing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:4:24-41:4:24" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 4:24</a>) Jehovah’s direction is clear and right, but we need to have the proper attitude so that we can accept what he says. If we are not careful, we might listen to Satan’s wicked advice instead of God’s loving direction. Never allow worldly music, videos, TV shows, books, associates, educators, or so-called experts to control your life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Colossians 2:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Satan knows that we are sinful humans. When he tries to make us give in to our weaknesses, it can be very difficult for us to remain loyal to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:47" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 8:44-47</a>) For <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>example, we may have stopped praying, slowed down in our ministry, or started missing meetings. These are all warning signs of what is happening in our heart, and it would be dangerous to ignore them. If we are not alert, we might stop hearing Jehovah’s voice little by little. Eventually, we may give in to our desires and do something wrong that we never thought we would do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:15-45:7:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 7:15</a>) But we can avoid making this tragic mistake if we stay alert to the warning signs and act immediately to correct matters. If we listen carefully to Jehovah’s voice, we will never listen to any apostate ideas.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:9-20:11:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why is it very important to become aware of our sinful tendencies as early as possible?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When a person is seriously sick, there is a better chance of a cure if he finds out about his sickness early. Similarly, if we notice that we have a sinful tendency, we must act immediately, before we are “caught alive by [Satan] to do his will.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:26-55:2:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:26</a>) What should we do if we realize that we have allowed our thoughts and desires to become different from what Jehovah requires of us? We must immediately return to him, seek his guidance, and follow it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:44:22-23:44:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:22</a>) The reality, though, is that the results of some mistakes may cause deep pain even after a person returns to Jehovah. It would be so much better never to leave Jehovah in the first place.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>We must recognize that our heart can lead us away from Jehovah. For example, we could become proud or greedy. These qualities can cause us to make serious mistakes. A proud person may think that he is special and that he can do whatever he wants. He may feel that no one can tell him what to do, including his fellow Christians, the elders, or even the organization. He may get so far <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>away from Jehovah that he can barely hear His voice.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah appointed Moses and Aaron to lead Israel through the desert. But Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled because they were proud and wanted to worship Jehovah in their own way. How did Jehovah respond? He killed the rebels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:26:8-4:26:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Numbers 26:8-10</a>) We learn an important lesson from this example. Rebellion against Jehovah leads to disaster. The Bible says that “pride is before a crash.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:18-20:16:18" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:13:11-23:13:11" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Isaiah 13:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Greed is also dangerous. A greedy person often feels that Jehovah’s direction does not apply to him. He may think he can take things that are not his. Naaman, a Syrian army chief, had leprosy, and God’s prophet Elisha healed him. Naaman was so grateful that he offered Elisha gifts of money and clothing, which he refused. But Elisha had a servant named Gehazi who wanted those gifts for himself. Gehazi became greedy. Without telling Elisha, he ran after Naaman and told him lies so that Naaman would give the gifts to him. What happened to greedy Gehazi? He was struck with leprosy!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Kings 5:20-27</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>If we allow it to, greed can quickly grow from a small desire to something that can ruin our life. This is clear in the Bible account of Achan. He said: “When I <strong>saw </strong>among the spoil a good-looking official garment from Shinar and 200 shekels of silver and one gold bar weighing 50 shekels, I <strong>desired </strong>them, so I <strong>took </strong>them.” Achan should have rejected his wrong desire. But instead he stole the goods and hid them in his tent. Jehovah made Achan’s sin known to everyone, and that same day the thief and his family were stoned to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:7:11-6:7:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Joshua 7:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:7:21-6:7:21" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:7:24-6:7:25" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) Any one of us could become greedy like Achan.

Even though we may occasionally have a bad thought, it is vital that we control our mind so that wrong desires do not cause us to sin.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Yes, both pride and greed can lead to disaster. Thinking about the effects of doing something wrong will help us to keep hearing Jehovah’s voice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:29-5:32:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>) In the Bible, Jehovah tells us about both the benefits of doing the right thing and the effects of doing the wrong thing. If we are tempted to do something wrong because of pride or greed, it would be wise to think about how it would affect us, our loved ones, and our relationship with Jehovah.</p>

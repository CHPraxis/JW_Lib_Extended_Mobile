<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH had a reason for creating the earth. He “formed it to be inhabited,” to be filled with people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>) The first human, Adam, was created perfect. Jehovah gave him the garden of Eden, a beautiful home with many trees and interesting animals. But there was something missing. Jehovah knew that, and he said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” Jehovah put Adam in a deep sleep and took one of his ribs and built it “into a woman.” When Adam woke up, he was very happy to see his wife! He said: “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man she was taken.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:18-1:2:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:18-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The woman was a gift from God to Adam. And she was a perfect helper for him. Also, she was given the special privilege to have children. The Bible says: “Adam <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:20-1:3:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 3:20</a>; footnote) Together, Adam and Eve would fill the earth with perfect humans. Our first parents and their children would have the privilege of making the whole earth into a paradise and caring for other living things.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>To have God’s approval, Adam and Eve needed to obey Jehovah and accept his authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15-17</a>) Only by remaining faithful to God would they be allowed to do everything God purposed for them. Sadly, Adam and Eve did not obey Jehovah. Instead, they listened to Satan and sinned against God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>) How has this act of disobedience affected women?

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah expected Adam to explain why he disobeyed. What was his weak excuse? “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:12-1:3:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 3:12</a>) Adam did not feel sorry about what he had done. Instead, he tried to blame Eve, and he even tried to blame Jehovah, the Creator of his wife. Even though Adam and Eve both sinned, Jehovah held Adam responsible for their decision. For this reason, the Bible says that “through <strong>one man </strong>sin entered into the world and death through sin.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Satan convinced Adam and Eve that they did not need Jehovah to be their Ruler. That raised the question about who has the right to rule humans. To answer that question, Jehovah has allowed humans to rule themselves for a period of time. What has been the result? Humans have caused one disaster after another. In the last one hundred years or so, about 100,000,000 people have died in wars. As the Bible says, “it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) That is why true Christians accept Jehovah as their Ruler.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 3:5, 6</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Men and women have suffered in this world that is ruled by Satan.

For example, around the world about 1 in 3 women have been attacked by their own husbands or boyfriends. Also, in some cultures it is common to favor boys. Why? Because when they grow up, they can look after their parents and continue their family name. In certain places, girls are considered worthless, and parents abort them before they are born.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah is in no way pleased by crimes against women. He treats women in a fair and respectful way. When Jehovah created Eve, she was not made to be a slave for Adam. She was perfect and had many qualities that made her a wonderful complement to her husband. That is one reason why the Bible says that after God finished with his creative work, he “saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>) Certainly, Adam and Eve had a very good start.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">IMAGINE that you had to speak to the most powerful ruler on earth as a representative of God’s people. How would you feel? You would probably feel anxious, afraid, and unable to speak. How would you prepare what to say? Would you be able to speak with authority as a messenger of God?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Moses was in that exact situation. He was a very humble person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:12:3-4:12:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 12:3</a>) But Jehovah sent him to speak to Pharaoh, a very rude and proud man. Jehovah asked Moses to give an order to Pharaoh. The order was to free millions of God’s people from slavery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:5:1-2:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 5:1, 2</a>) We can understand why Moses asked Jehovah: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” Moses probably felt that he did not have the ability to speak to Pharaoh. But Jehovah promised Moses that he would not be alone. “I will prove to be with you,” said Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:9-2:3:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 3:9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) Why was Moses afraid? (b) Why might your feelings be similar to those of Moses?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Why was Moses afraid? He was afraid that Pharaoh <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>would not receive or pay attention to a messenger of Jehovah God. Moses was also afraid that the Israelites would doubt whether God had chosen him to lead them out of Egypt. He said to Jehovah: “Suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘Jehovah did not appear to you.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:15-2:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 3:15-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:1-2:4:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When Moses said to Jehovah that he was afraid people would not believe him, God prepared Moses so that he would be successful. The Bible states: “Jehovah said to [Moses]: ‘What is that in your hand?’ He answered: ‘A rod.’ He said: ‘Throw it on the ground.’ So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. Jehovah now said to Moses: ‘Reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.’ So he reached out and seized it, and it became a rod in his hand. God then said: ‘This is so that they may believe that Jehovah . . . has appeared to you.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:2-2:4:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 4:2-5</a>) By God’s power, the rod became a snake in Moses’ hand! This miracle would prove that Moses was God’s messenger and had authority from Him. Jehovah told him: “You will take this rod in your hand and perform the signs with it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:17-2:4:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 4:17</a>) With this proof, Moses could have the confidence needed to go to speak to Pharaoh and also to God’s people.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:29-2:4:31" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 4:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:7:8-2:7:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7:8-13</a>.</p>

We have the Bible, and we are eager to use it. Some people think that the Bible is simply a good book. But the Bible is more than that. It contains God’s message to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:21</a>) It contains God’s promises and tells us what his Kingdom will do. Paul wrote: “The word of God is alive and exerts power.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>How is the word of God alive? All the promises of Jehovah progress toward their fulfillment, and they will be completely successful.

With this tool, we can prove that what we say can be trusted and comes from God. That is why when Paul was training Timothy, he encouraged him to handle “the word of the truth aright.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:15</a>) How can we apply Paul’s counsel? By carefully choosing the scriptures we will read to others. Our goal is to touch the hearts of those who listen to us. The tracts we received in 2013 were designed to help us do that.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What did one service overseer say about the tracts?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>All the new tracts have the same format. So when we learn how to use one, we know how to use them all. One service overseer in Hawaii, U.S.A., wrote: “Little did we realize how effective these new tools would be both in the house-to-house work and in public witnessing.” Why are the tracts so easy to use? He feels that this is because of the question and the possible answers found on the front of them. The householder does not have to worry about giving a wrong answer. The brother says that because of the way the tracts are written, many more people are willing to talk, and this leads to interesting conversations.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) How are our tracts designed to help us use the Bible? (b) Which tracts have you had the most success using, and why?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Each tract contains a carefully chosen scripture that we can read to the householder. Take, for example, the tract <strong><em>Will Suffering Ever End?</em></strong> Ask the householder the question on the cover. He can pick “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” as the answer. Whatever his answer is, turn to the inside page and simply say, “Here is what the Bible says.” Then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When you use the tract <strong><em>How Do You View the Bible?</em></strong> it does not <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>matter which of the three answers the householder chooses. Just turn to the inside of the tract and say, “The Bible says that ‘all Scripture is inspired of God.’” You could add, “Actually, that passage says much more.” Then open your Bible, and read all of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>(a) In what way can you use tracts to make your ministry more enjoyable? (b) How can tracts help you prepare for return visits?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>You may decide to read and discuss more from the tract. This will depend on the reaction of the householder. But no matter how people react, they will have received the message from the tract, and you will have read some of God’s Word to them. Even if you read only one or two verses the first time you visit them, you can return later and continue the conversation.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>On the back of each tract there is the subtitle “To Think About.” Under this subtitle, there are scriptures and a question that can be discussed on a return visit. In the tract <strong><em>How Do You View the Future?</em></strong> the question is “How will God change our world for the better?” <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Daniel 2:44</a> are cited. For the tract <strong><em>Can the Dead Really Live Again?</em></strong> the question is “Why do we grow old and die?” <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Romans 5:12</a> are cited.</p>

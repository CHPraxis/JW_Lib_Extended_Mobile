<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We will be very happy! In Paradise, people will not fight or go to war anymore. Everyone will love one another. Nobody will get sick or die. The blind will see, the deaf will hear, and those who cannot walk will be able to run and jump. Everyone will have plenty to eat. And animals will be friends with one another and with us. People who have died will come back to life. Many of the men and women you have learned about in this brochure like Rebekah, Rahab, David, and Elijah will come back to life too! <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span><strong>Would you like to meet them when they come back?—</strong></p>

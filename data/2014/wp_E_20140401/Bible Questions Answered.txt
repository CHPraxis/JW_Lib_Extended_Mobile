BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What will Jesus do in the future?

In the year 33 C.E., Jesus died, rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven. Much later, Jesus was given authority to rule as King. (Daniel 7:13, 14) In the future, Jesus will take action as King to establish world peace and eliminate poverty.—Read Psalm 72:7, 8, 13.
As King, Jesus will cleanse the earth of unrighteousness

Jesus will do marvelous things as Ruler of mankind. He will use the power that the Father has given him to restore humans to perfection. They will enjoy life on earth without ever growing old and dying.—Read John 5:26-29; 1 Corinthians 15:25, 26.



What is Jesus doing now?

Jesus is now directing the worldwide preaching work of his true followers. They visit people to show them what the Bible says about God’s Kingdom. Jesus said he would continue to support the work of his disciples until God’s Kingdom brings human governments to an end.—Read Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20.
By means of the true Christian congregation, Jesus is guiding people into a better way of life. He will continue to guide them through the destruction of the present system of things into God’s promised new world.—Read 2 Peter 3:7, 13; Revelation 7:17.

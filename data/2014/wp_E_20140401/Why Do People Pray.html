<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Is prayer part of your life? It is for many people, even some atheists. But why do people pray? According to a poll in France, half of French citizens pray or meditate at times “simply to feel better.” Like many Europeans, they do not pray in a religious sense. Rather, they seek “the soothing effects of prayer.” On the other hand, some believers turn to God only when they are in need, expecting immediate answers to their requests.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:26:16-23:26:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What about you personally? Do you think that prayer is just a way to sort out your thoughts? If you believe in God, do you see the effects of prayer in your life? Or does it seem to you that your prayers go unanswered? The Bible can help you to view prayer, not as a feel-good therapy, but as a precious means to draw close to God.</p>

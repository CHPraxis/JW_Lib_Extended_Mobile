To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in December

“We are here as a public service to families. Many parents want their children to love God. Do you think this is something that parents can teach their children, or must children learn to love God on their own?” Allow for response. Show the back of the December 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.



The Watchtower December 1

“We are making brief visits to talk about God. We know that everyone has his own opinion about God. Do you think that most people view him as an impersonal force of nature or as a friend who cares about them personally? [Allow for response.] This Bible verse tells us what kind of relationship God wants us to have with him. [Read James 4:8a.] This magazine outlines three things that we can do to feel closer to God.”



Awake! December

“We are visiting briefly because of concern over a common health problem. According to the World Health Organization, mental disorders, such as depression, will affect one in four people at some point in their lives. Do you think that mental disorders are becoming more common? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives us hope that in the future, life on earth will be free of illness and pain. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] This magazine outlines a few things that everyone should know about mental disorders.”

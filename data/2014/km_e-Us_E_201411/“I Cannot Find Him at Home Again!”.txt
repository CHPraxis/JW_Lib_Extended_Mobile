“I Cannot Find Him at Home Again!”




Have you ever said that about someone who showed interest? Even though you have repeatedly tried to visit the person, you are unable to water the seed of truth you planted. (1 Cor. 3:6) At times, experienced publishers write a letter to someone they have not been able to find at home, or they leave a note in the person’s door. Some publishers anticipate the challenge of finding the person at home again and request his phone number, perhaps by asking, “Do you text?” A return visit may be counted when we visit the person or witness to him by means of a letter, an e-mail, a text, a note left in his door, or a telephone call. Even if he is seldom at home, it is possible for us to further his interest.

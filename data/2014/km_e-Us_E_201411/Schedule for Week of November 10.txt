How can those in the group gain the most benefit from your visit? How do you assist individual publishers who approach you to receive help with a particular aspect of the ministry?
20 min: “Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Showing Personal Interest.” Discussion. After discussing the article, have a two-part demonstration.

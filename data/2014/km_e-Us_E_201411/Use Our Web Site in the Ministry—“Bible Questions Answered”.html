<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The “Bible Teachings” section of jw.org has a feature called “Bible Questions Answered.” If we are familiar with these frequently asked questions, we can direct inquiring householders to our Web site for Scriptural answers. These questions can also be used to start conversations in the ministry. We could pick a question that is of interest to people in our territory, ask the householder for his opinion, and then tell him what the Bible says, using the reasoning from jw.org. Afterward, we can explain or show him where we found our information. Another option is to let him read the answer directly from the Web site. The wife of a traveling overseer has had good success by saying: “Many people wonder, ‘Is God to blame for our suffering?’ Would you like to know the answer in just 51 seconds?” She then plays the audio version of the answer that she has downloaded to her mobile device. She concludes by introducing <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005141/1-34">chapter 11 of the <em>Bible Teach</em></a> book.</p>

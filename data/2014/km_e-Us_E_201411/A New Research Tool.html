<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Millions of publishers earth wide have made good use of the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>to do research. However, because it is very detailed, it is available in only a limited number of languages. Therefore, the <em>Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>has been prepared in some 170 languages. The publications referenced in the <em>Research Guide </em>are primarily from the year 2000 onward. The <em>Research Guide </em>has not been printed in languages that already have the <em>Index </em>but is included in electronic format in <em>Watchtower Library </em>and <em>Watchtower<wbr />—ONLINE LIBRARY. </em>The <em>Research Guide </em>will help you search for answers to Bible questions, find information regarding personal concerns, and prepare for congregation meetings and family worship.</p>

Even though you have repeatedly tried to visit the person, you are unable to water the seed of truth you planted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6</a>) At times, experienced publishers write a letter to someone they have not been able to find at home, or they leave a note in the person’s door. Some publishers anticipate the challenge of finding the person at home again and request his phone number, perhaps by asking, “Do you text?” A return visit may be counted when we visit the person or witness to him by means of a letter, an e-mail, a text, a note left in his door, or a telephone call. Even if he is seldom at home, it is possible for us to further his interest.</p>

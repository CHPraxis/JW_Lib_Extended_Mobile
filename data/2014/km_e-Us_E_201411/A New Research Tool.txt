A New Research Tool




Millions of publishers earth wide have made good use of the Watch Tower Publications Index to do research. However, because it is very detailed, it is available in only a limited number of languages. Therefore, the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses has been prepared in some 170 languages. The publications referenced in the Research Guide are primarily from the year 2000 onward. The Research Guide has not been printed in languages that already have the Index but is included in electronic format in Watchtower Library and Watchtower—ONLINE LIBRARY. The Research Guide will help you search for answers to Bible questions, find information regarding personal concerns, and prepare for congregation meetings and family worship.

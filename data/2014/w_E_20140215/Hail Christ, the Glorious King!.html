<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">A GLORIOUS king rides in the cause of truth and righteousness and goes forth to conquer his enemies.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The 45th Psalm, though, is much more than an exciting story with a happy ending.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) What is “something good” that concerns us, and how can it affect our heart? (b) In what way ‘is our song about a king,’ and how does our tongue become like a stylus?</p>

The good news of the Messianic Kingdom is something good that touches our heart. The Kingdom message became especially “good” in 1914. Since then, the message no longer concerns a future Kingdom but has to do with a real government now functioning in the heavens. This is the “good news of the Kingdom” that we preach “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Is our heart “stirred” by the Kingdom message? Do we preach the good news of the Kingdom with zeal? Like the psalmist, our “song is about a king”<wbr />—our King Jesus Christ. We proclaim him as the enthroned heavenly King of the Messianic Kingdom. Moreover, we invite all<wbr />—the rulers and the ruled—<wbr />to submit to his kingship.

As a perfect man, doubtless he was “handsome.” However, his outstanding handsomeness came from his faithfulness to Jehovah and his unbending integrity. In addition, Jesus used “gracious speech” when he preached the message of the Kingdom.

The apostle Paul wrote: “When he [Jesus] came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason, God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend<wbr />—of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground—<wbr />and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:8-50:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 2:8-11</a>) Jehovah blessed Jesus “forever” by resurrecting him to immortal life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:9-45:6:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 6:9</a>.</p>

Jesus was anointed with “the oil of exultation” more than his “companions,” that is, the kings of Judah of the line of David. How so? For one thing, Jesus was anointed by Jehovah himself. Furthermore, Jehovah anointed him as both King and High Priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:2:2-19:2:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:5-58:5:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 5:5, 6</a>) In addition, <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Jesus was anointed not with oil but with holy spirit, and his kingship is not earthly but heavenly.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah installed his Son as his Messianic King in the heavens in 1914. ‘The scepter of his kingdom is a scepter of uprightness,’ so the righteousness and equity of his reign are guaranteed. His authority is legitimate, since ‘God is his throne.’ That is, Jehovah is the foundation of his kingdom.

He wages a righteous war with noble objectives. He rides “in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.” The greatest truth that must be defended is that of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty. Satan challenged the legitimacy of Jehovah’s rulership when he rebelled against Him. Since then, that fundamental truth has been disputed by both demons and humans.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:45:3-19:45:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3</a>) But the time comes for him to take the sword and wield it with his right hand. The psalmist prophesies: “Your right hand will accomplish awe-inspiring things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:45:4-19:45:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 45:4</a>) When Jesus Christ rides forth to execute Jehovah’s judgments at Armageddon, he will accomplish “awe-inspiring things” against his enemies. Just what means he will use to destroy Satan’s system, we do not know. But that action will strike terror in the heart of the inhabitants of the earth who have not heeded the divine warning to submit to the King’s rule. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:2:11-19:2:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 2:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In his prophecy regarding the time of the end, Jesus said that people would become “faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.” He added: “And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:26-42:21:27" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 21:26, 27</a>.</p>

And the one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:11" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:14-66:19:15" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>.</p>

Will his armies include others? Jesus made this promise to his anointed brothers: “To the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as I have received from my Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:2:26-66:2:27" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 2:26, 27</a>) So Christ’s heavenly armies will also include his anointed brothers, who by then will have received their heavenly reward.

Jeremiah’s prophecy foretells: “Those slain by Jehovah in that day will be from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:25:33-24:25:33" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jer. 25:33</a>) A parallel prophecy states: “I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: ‘Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them, and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:17-66:19:18" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Rev. 19:17, 18</a>.</p>

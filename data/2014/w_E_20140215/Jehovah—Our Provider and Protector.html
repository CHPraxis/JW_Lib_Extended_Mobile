<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JEHOVAH is responsible for the existence of the family arrangement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 3:14, 15</a>) Even if we belong to the same family, however, we have different traits and circumstances. You may have lived with your parents from birth to adulthood. Others may have lost their parents in death, perhaps because of sickness, an accident, or some other tragedy. Still others do not even know who their parents are.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Among members of Jehovah’s family of worshippers, spiritual backgrounds also vary. You may have been ‘brought up in the truth,’ as some say, and your parents inculcated godly principles in you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>) Or you may be one of the thousands who have come to learn the truth through the preaching activity of other servants of Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Despite the factors just mentioned, all of us have certain things in common. We suffer the consequences of Adam’s disobedience and have inherited imperfection, sin, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Even so, as true worshippers, we can rightly address Jehovah as “our Father.” Referring to God’s <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>chosen people of ancient times, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:8</a> states: “O Jehovah, you are our Father.” Moreover, Jesus opened his model prayer with the words: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>As we examine the depth of our appreciation for our Father, Jehovah, what will it be helpful to consider?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Our heavenly Father provides the care and protection we need as a people calling on his name in faith. The psalmist quotes him as saying: “Because he [a true worshipper] has affection for me, I will rescue him. I will protect him because he knows my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:14-19:91:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 91:14</a>) Yes, Jehovah God lovingly provides escape from our enemies and protects us as his people, so that we are not wiped out.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>To enhance our appreciation for our heavenly Father, let us consider three important factors: (1) Our Father is our Provider. (2) Jehovah is our Protector. (3) And God is our best Friend. As we consider these points, it will be helpful to meditate on our relationship with God and discern how we can honor him as our Father. It will also be beneficial to reflect on the blessings Jehovah holds out to those who draw close to him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jas. 4:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah is indeed the Grand Provider in ways without number. For instance, his undeserved kindness comes to our rescue. Yes, all of us are sinful and have inherited imperfection from our first earthly father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23</a>) Nevertheless, because of Jehovah’s love, he took the initiative to open the way for us to have a close relationship with him. “By this the love of God was revealed in our case,” wrote the apostle John, “that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>How did Jehovah prove to be the Grand Provider in the time of Abraham and Isaac? (See opening image.)</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>In the 19th century B.C.E., a prophetic event unfolded that reveals the extent of Jehovah’s loving provision for obedient humans to enjoy everlasting life. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:17-58:11:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:17-19</a> explains: “By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac<wbr />—the man who had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son—<wbr />although it had been said to him: ‘What will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.’ But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.” It is not difficult to see the parallel. Jehovah offered his Son, Jesus Christ, in behalf of the world of mankind.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>John 3:16,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> <strong>36</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>As we meditate on how Jehovah proves to be the Grand Provider, we gratefully acknowledge the vital role played by Jesus Christ, even as Paul did when he wrote: “This is what we have concluded, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died. And he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Because of their love for God and their gratitude for the inestimable privilege of serving him, the early Christians gladly accepted “the ministry of the reconciliation.” Their work of preaching and making disciples opened the way for honesthearted individuals to come to be at peace with God, enjoy his friendship, and eventually become his spiritual children. Today, anointed servants of Jehovah perform the same ministry. What they accomplish as ambassadors for God and Christ makes it possible for rightly disposed people to be drawn by Jehovah and become believers.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:18-47:5:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 5:18-20;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> John 6:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Acts 13:48</a>.</p>

In this activity, we make use of the Bible, another of God’s splendid provisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) By skillful use of God’s inspired Word in our ministry, we give others the opportunity to gain everlasting life. To help us in this work, each of us relies on yet another provision from Jehovah<wbr />—his holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Zech. 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>) The results are impressive, as shown in each edition of the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>What an honor it is to share in this work to the praise of our Father and Provider!</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In view of all that God has provided, we do well to ask ourselves: ‘Am I doing all I can in my ministry to show Jehovah the depth of my appreciation for his provisions? In what ways can I improve and become a more effective preacher of the good news?’ We can demonstrate our gratitude for God’s wonderful provisions by keeping Kingdom interests first in our lives. If we do so, Jehovah will see to it that our needs are cared for. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:25-40:6:33" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 6:25-33</a>) Because of God’s love, we surely want to do as much as we can to please him and make his heart rejoice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>A loving father not only provides for his children but also seeks to protect them. He would naturally try to rescue them if they were in danger. One brother remembers a specific incident that occurred when he was just a young boy. He and his father were returning home from the field service when their path took them across a stream. A heavy downpour that morning had caused the brook to flood. The only way to cross the water was to jump from one large stone to another. Going ahead of his father, the boy lost his footing on one of the stones, tumbled into the flooding water, and went under twice. How grateful the boy was that his father quickly grabbed him firmly by the shoulder and saved him from drowning! Our heavenly Father delivers us from what might be viewed as raging torrents of this wicked world and from its ruler, Satan. Jehovah is certainly the best Protector anyone could ever hope to have.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:13-40:6:13" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The loving protection made possible by Jehovah is well-illustrated by what occurred after he rescued the Israelites from Egyptian bondage and miraculously protected them as they crossed the Red Sea in 1513 B.C.E.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>In view of the divine prophecy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, Satan may have been desperate as he looked for an opportunity to attack the vulnerable Israelites.

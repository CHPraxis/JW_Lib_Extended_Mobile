<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">IT ALWAYS takes time to prepare for a wedding. But we will focus on a very special wedding<wbr />—a royal one at that. Just imagine! It has been in preparation for about 2,000 years. Now the time is rapidly approaching when the bridegroom will be united with his bride. Soon, joyful music will fill the King’s palace, and heavenly throngs will sing out: “Praise Jah, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king! Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:6-66:19:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 19:6, 7</a>.</p>

When does the wedding take place? This marriage will cause joy in heaven, but will those who hope to live forever on earth join in that rejoicing?

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Over the centuries, Christ has been preparing his future bride for the heavenly wedding. The apostle Paul explained that Christ “loved the congregation and gave himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word, so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but holy and without blemish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:25-49:5:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eph. 5:25-27</a>) Paul told the anointed Christians in ancient Corinth: “I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I personally promised you in marriage to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:2</a>) The Bridegroom-King Jesus Christ appreciates the spiritual “beauty” of his future bride.

At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2</a>, the bride is compared to a city, New Jerusalem, and is “adorned for her husband.” This heavenly city has <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>“the glory of God” and is radiant, “like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone shining crystal clear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:10-66:21:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 21:10, 11</a>) The resplendence of New Jerusalem is beautifully described in the book of Revelation.

And she is! Indeed, “her clothing is adorned with gold,” and “she will be brought to the king in richly woven garments.” For the marriage of the Lamb, “it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen<wbr />—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:8-66:19:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 19:8</a>.</p>

Although “his wife has prepared herself” for the marriage, what is stated subsequently does not describe the actual wedding.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11-21</a>) Does this mean that the marriage takes place before the Bridegroom-King completes his conquest? No. The visions in the book of Revelation are not presented in chronological order. In the 45th Psalm, the royal wedding occurs <em>after </em>the King Jesus Christ girds on his sword and ‘goes on to victory’ over his enemies.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:45:3-19:45:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3, 4</a>.</p>

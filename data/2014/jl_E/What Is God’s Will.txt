What Is God’s Will?




God wants us to live in peace and happiness on a paradise earth forever!
You may wonder, though, ‘How could that ever happen?’ The Bible says that God’s Kingdom will make it possible, and it is God’s will that all people learn about that Kingdom and his purpose for us.​—Psalm 37:11, 29; Isaiah 9:7.
God wants us to benefit ourselves.
Just as a good father wishes the best for his children, our heavenly Father desires that we enjoy eternal happiness. (Isaiah 48:17, 18) He has promised that “the one who does the will of God remains forever.”​—1 John 2:17.
God wants us to walk in his paths.
The Bible says that our Creator wants to “instruct us about his ways” so that we can “walk in his paths.” (Isaiah 2:2, 3) He has organized “a people for his name” to make his will known throughout the earth.​—Acts 15:14.
God wants us to unite in worship of him.
Instead of dividing people, Jehovah’s pure worship unites them in genuine love. (John 13:35) Who today are teaching men and women everywhere how to serve God in unity? We invite you to find out by means of this brochure.

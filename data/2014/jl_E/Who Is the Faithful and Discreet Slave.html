<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">Shortly before his death, Jesus had a private conversation with four of his disciples​—Peter, James, John, and Andrew. As Jesus was foretelling the sign of his presence in the last days, he raised a vital question: “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:3-41:13:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Mark 13:3, 4</a>) Jesus was assuring his disciples that as their “master,” he would appoint those who would provide a steady supply of spiritual food for his followers during the time of the end. Who would make up this slave?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>It is a small group of anointed followers of Jesus. </strong>The “slave” is closely identified with the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It dispenses timely spiritual food to fellow worshippers of Jehovah. We are dependent on this faithful slave to keep giving us our “measure of food supplies at the proper time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:42-42:12:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 12:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>It manages the household of God. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:15-54:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:15</a>) Jesus gave the slave the weighty responsibility of managing the work of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization​—looking after its material assets, directing the preaching activity, and teaching us through our congregations. Thus, to provide us with what we need when we need it, “the faithful and discreet slave” is distributing spiritual food by means of the publications we use in our ministry, as well as through the programs that are presented at our meetings and assemblies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">The slave is <em>faithful </em>to Bible truths and to its commission to preach the good news, and it is <em>discreet </em>about how it wisely cares for Christ’s interests on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) Jehovah is blessing its work with increase and abundant spiritual provisions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 65:13</a>.</p>

Will You Do Jehovah’s Will?




Thank you for taking the time to examine this brochure in order to familiarize yourself with Jehovah’s Witnesses as a people, to learn about our activities, and to see our organization in action. We hope that it has helped you to identify us as the ones who are doing Jehovah’s will today. We encourage you to keep on taking in knowledge of God, to tell the rest of your family and friends about what you are learning, and to associate regularly with us at our Christian meetings.​—Hebrews 10:23-25.
You will find that the more you learn about Jehovah, the more you can see how much he truly loves you. You will then be motivated to do all you can to show your love for him in return. (1 John 4:8-10, 19) But how can you demonstrate that desire in your daily life? Why is obeying his moral standards in your best interests? And what will help you want to do God’s will along with us? Your Bible teacher will be pleased to explore the answers with you so that you and your family can “keep yourselves in God’s love, . . . with everlasting life in view.”​—Jude 21.
We warmly invite you to continue making progress in the way of the truth by studying the publication “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love” next.

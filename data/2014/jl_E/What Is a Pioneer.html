<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">The term “pioneer” often refers to those who explore new territories and open up a way for others to follow. Jesus was a pioneer of sorts, having been sent to the earth to perform a life-giving ministry and to open the way to salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Today, his followers are imitating him by spending as much time as possible ‘making disciples.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) Some have been able to take up what we call the pioneer service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>A pioneer is a full-time evangelizer. </strong>All of Jehovah’s Witnesses are publishers of the good news. However, some have organized their life to serve as <strong><em>regular pioneers, </em></strong>spending 70 hours each month in the preaching work. To do this, many limit their secular work to part-time. Others are selected to serve as <strong><em>special pioneers </em></strong>in areas where the need for Kingdom proclaimers is greater, devoting 130 hours or more to the ministry each month. The pioneers are content to live a modest lifestyle, confident that Jehovah will supply them with the necessities of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:6-8</a>) Those who cannot pioneer full-time may serve as <strong><em>auxiliary pioneers </em></strong>as they are able, increasing their preaching activity to 30 or 50 hours a month.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>A pioneer is motivated by love for God and for people. </strong>Like Jesus, we notice the desperate spiritual condition that many find themselves in today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 6:34</a>) But we have knowledge that can help them right now, giving them a solid hope for the future. Love of neighbor motivates a pioneer to give generously of his time and energy to help others spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:8-52:2:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>) As a result, his faith is strengthened, he draws closer to God, and he experiences much happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

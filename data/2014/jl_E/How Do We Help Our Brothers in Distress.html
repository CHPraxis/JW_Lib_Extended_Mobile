<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">When a disaster strikes, Jehovah’s Witnesses immediately organize assistance to bring relief to their brothers who are affected. Such efforts demonstrate the genuineness of our love for one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:17, 18</a>) In what ways do we help?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>We donate funds. </strong>When a great famine occurred in Judea, early Christians in Antioch sent financial help to their spiritual brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a>) Similarly, when we learn that our brothers in some part of the world are facing hardship, we send donations through our local congregation to supply material aid to those in critical need.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:13-47:8:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>We provide practical assistance. </strong>The elders who are at the scene of a disaster locate each congregation member to ensure that everyone is accounted for and safe. A relief committee may coordinate the supplying of food, clean drinking water, clothing, shelter, and medical help. Many Witnesses with the needed skills volunteer to go at their own expense and participate in the relief work or to repair damaged homes and Kingdom Halls. The unity that we enjoy as an organization and the experience we have gained in working together enable us to mobilize quickly in times of need. Although we extend our hand to “those related to us in the faith,” we assist others too when possible, whatever their religion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>We offer spiritual and emotional support. </strong>Victims of a disaster especially need comfort. At such times, we draw strength from Jehovah, “the God of all comfort.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>) We gladly share the Bible’s promises with those in despair, offering the assurance that soon God’s Kingdom will bring an end to all the tragedies that cause pain and suffering.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

Have you noticed in the pictures in this brochure how well-dressed Jehovah’s Witnesses are when attending their congregation meetings? Why do we pay such attention to our dress and grooming?
To show respect for our God. It is true that God looks beyond our outward appearance. (1 Samuel 16:7) However, when we gather to worship him, our heartfelt desire is to show respect both for him and for our fellow worshippers. If we were to stand before a judge in court, we would likely give attention to our appearance out of regard for his position. Likewise, the way we appear at meetings shows our esteem for “the Judge of all the earth,” Jehovah God, and for the place where we worship him.​—Genesis 18:25.
To reflect the values that we live by. The Bible encourages Christians to dress “with modesty and soundness of mind.” (1 Timothy 2:9, 10) Dressing “with modesty” means avoiding clothing that might draw attention to us by being showy, provocative, or revealing. Also, having “soundness of mind” helps us to choose attractive clothing that is not sloppy or extreme. These principles still leave room for a great variety of personal choices. Without our saying a word, our attractive and tasteful appearance can “adorn the teaching of our Savior” and “glorify God.” (Titus 2:10; 1 Peter 2:12) By dressing up for the meetings, we thus influence how others view the worship of Jehovah.
Do not let your clothing hold you back from attending the Kingdom Hall. Our clothes do not need to be expensive or fancy to be appropriate, clean, and presentable.

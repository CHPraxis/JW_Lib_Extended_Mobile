STUDY ARTICLES
▪  How Should We “Answer Each Person”?
▪  Follow the Golden Rule in Your Ministry
In our ministry, we sometimes face challenging questions. The first of these two articles considers three methods we can use to give persuasive answers. (Col. 4:6) The second article shows what effect Jesus’ words recorded at Matthew 7:12 should have on our preaching activity.

▪  Jehovah Is a God of Organization
▪  Are You Moving Ahead With Jehovah’s Organization?
Jehovah has always organized his servants. In these two articles, learn what God requires of us as his people. Also see why it is vital for us to remain loyal to the organization that Jehovah is using today.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH created the family arrangement.

Still others may not even know who their parents are.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We are all members of Jehovah’s family of worshippers and have learned the truth in different ways.

The apostle John wrote: “By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When we meditate on all that Jehovah has provided for us, we realize that without Jesus’ sacrifice we would not be able to become a friend of God. Paul wrote: “This is what we have concluded, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died. And he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

Today, anointed servants of Jehovah perform the same ministry. They serve as ambassadors for God and Christ.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Since God has provided so much for us, we should ask ourselves: ‘Am I doing all I can in my ministry to show Jehovah how thankful I am for everything he has given me? How can I become a better preacher of the good news?’ If we are grateful for everything God gives us, we will put his Kingdom first in our lives. When we do this, Jehovah will make sure that we always have everything we need.

He and his father were returning home from field service when they had to cross a stream. Heavy rain that morning had caused the stream to flood. The only way to cross the water was to jump from one large stone to another. Going ahead of his father, the boy lost his balance, fell into the stream, and went under the water twice. That boy was so grateful when his father quickly grabbed him by the shoulder and saved him from <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>drowning.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Since the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> had not yet been fulfilled, Satan must have been desperate to attack the Israelites, who seemed to be unprotected.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:24:20-4:24:20" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Numbers 24:20</a>) How did Jehovah protect his people from these enemies by means of Joshua, Moses, Aaron, and Hur? As Joshua and his men fought the Amalekites, on a nearby hill were Moses, Aaron, and Hur. As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up, Jehovah helped the Israelites to be stronger than their enemies. When Moses could not hold his hands up any longer, Aaron and Hur helped him by <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>supporting his hands.

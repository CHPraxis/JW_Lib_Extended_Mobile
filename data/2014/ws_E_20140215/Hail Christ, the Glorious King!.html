<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) What is “something good” that the psalmist wrote about, and how can it affect our heart? (b) What message “about a king” do we preach? How does our tongue become like a stylus?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:45:1-19:45:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 45:1</strong></a><strong>. </strong>“Something good” that causes the psalmist’s heart to be “stirred” is news about a king. In Hebrew, the word translated “is stirred” originally meant “to bubble up,” or “boil.” The psalmist was so excited to hear this news that it was as if his heart was bubbling up, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>or overflowing, with enthusiasm. It also made his tongue become like “the stylus of a skilled copyist.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>What does that mean for us? The good news of the Messianic Kingdom is something good that stirs our heart. The Kingdom message became especially “good” in 1914. Why? Because from that year on, it was no longer about a future Kingdom. Since 1914, the message has been about a real government that now rules in heaven. This is the “good news of the Kingdom” that we preach “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Is our heart “stirred,” or excited, by this Kingdom message? Do we preach the good news of the Kingdom with real enthusiasm? Like the psalmist, our “song is about a king.” We preach the message that Jesus is now Ruler of the Messianic Kingdom in heaven. We invite all, even the leaders of this world, to accept Jesus’ Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:2:1-19:2:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:2:4-19:2:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 4-12</a>) And our tongue becomes like “the stylus of a skilled copyist” when we use the Bible in our preaching work.</p>

As a perfect man, he must have been “handsome.” But it was his integrity and faithfulness to Jehovah that made him truly handsome.

The apostle Paul wrote about Jesus: “When he came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason, God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend<wbr />—of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground—<wbr />and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:8-50:2:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 2:8-11</a>) Jehovah blessed Jesus “forever” by resurrecting him to immortal life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:9-45:6:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 6:9</a>.</p>

Jesus was anointed with “the oil of exultation” more than his “companions,” the kings of Judah who were also descendants of David. In what ways? First of all, Jesus was anointed by Jehovah himself. Second, Jehovah anointed Jesus to rule as King and also serve as High Priest.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why can we be sure that Jesus’ rule is righteous? What does it mean that God is Jesus’ throne?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>In 1914, Jehovah appointed his Son as the Messianic King in heaven. “The scepter” of Jesus’ Kingdom “is a scepter of uprightness,” so we can be sure that his rule will always be fair and righteous.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:45:3-19:45:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 45:3</a>) He then takes the sword in his right hand and begins to use it.

It says: “I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse. And the one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:7-66:12:9" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-9</a>) So it makes sense that at the war of Armageddon, Christ’s armies will include the holy angels. Will anyone else be in Christ’s armies? Jesus made this promise to his anointed brothers: “To the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as I have received from my Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:2:26-66:2:27" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Revelation 2:26, 27</a>) At that time, all of Christ’s anointed brothers will already have been raised to heaven.

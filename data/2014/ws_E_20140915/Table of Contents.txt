STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Are You Convinced That You Have the Truth? Why?
This article will discuss some reasons why many people say that Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth and why Witnesses themselves are convinced that they have the truth.

▪  Serve God Loyally Despite “Many Tribulations”
All of us will experience tribulations because we live in Satan’s world. Some trials are direct attacks on our faith. Other trials are more indirect. This article will help us to recognize how Satan tries to weaken our faith and how we can prepare for his attack.

▪  Parents—Shepherd Your Children
Parents have the responsibility to raise their children in the truth. (Ephesians 6:4) This article discusses three ways that parents can shepherd their children and help them to love Jehovah.

▪  The Last Enemy, Death, Brought to Nothing
Death and all that leads to it causes terrible suffering. Why do people die? How will ‘the last enemy, death, be brought to nothing’? (1 Corinthians 15:26) See how the answers highlight Jehovah’s justice, his wisdom, and especially his love.

▪  Remember Those in the Full-Time Service
Both in the past and today, many worshippers of Jehovah have worked hard in the full-time service. What can we do to remember their “faithful work” and “loving labor”?—1 Thessalonians 1:3.

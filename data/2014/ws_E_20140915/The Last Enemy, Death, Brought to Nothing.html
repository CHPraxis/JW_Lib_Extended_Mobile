<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">WHEN Adam and Eve were created, they had no enemies. They were perfect and lived in a paradise. They enjoyed a close relationship with their Creator as his son and daughter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:7-1:2:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 3:38</a>) God gave them an important assignment. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 1:28</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>How long would they need to live to complete this assignment? They would not need to live forever to “fill the earth and subdue it,” but they would need to live forever to care for “every living creature that is moving on the earth.” They could have enjoyed this assignment for eternity.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) What command did God give Adam and Eve? (b) How important was obedience to that command?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Even though Adam and Eve were made to live forever, they were not immortal. To stay alive, they needed to breathe, drink, sleep, and eat. But even more important was their relationship with Jehovah, the Source of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:8:3-5:8:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>) They could keep living and enjoy life only if they let Jehovah guide them. Even before creating Eve, Jehovah clearly told Adam: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>“The tree of the knowledge of good and bad” indicated that God had the right to decide what was good and what was bad. Adam already had a sense of good and bad because he was made in God’s image and had a conscience. The tree reminded Adam and Eve that they would always need Jehovah’s direction. If they ate from this tree, they would be saying to God, “We do not need your rules.” As a result, they and their children would die, just as God had warned them.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Why did Adam and Eve disobey Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Adam told Eve about Jehovah’s command. She knew it so well that she was later able to repeat it almost word for word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-3</a>) She repeated it to Satan, who was speaking through a serpent. Satan had allowed his desire for power and independence to grow. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>.) He told Eve that God was a liar and that if she disobeyed God, she would not die but would become like God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 3:4, 5</a>) Eve believed him, acted independently by eating the fruit, and told Adam to do the same. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:17-1:3:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Satan had lied to her. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:14-54:2:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 2:14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even though Adam knew it was wrong, he listened to his wife’s voice. This serpent may have seemed to be a friend, but the one speaking through it was a cruel enemy, one who knew what the terrible results of his lie would be.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>How did Jehovah handle his judgment of Adam and Eve?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Adam and Eve rebelled against Jehovah, who had given them life and every good thing they had. Of course, Jehovah knew exactly what had happened. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:3-20:15:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 15:3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But he had allowed Adam, Eve, and Satan to show how they really felt about him. As a Father, he must have been very hurt by their actions. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:6-1:6:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 6:6</a>.) But as a Judge, he carried out justice toward the sinners.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">Jehovah had allowed Adam, Eve, and Satan to show how they really felt about him</p>
</div>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>About the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, God had told Adam: “In the day you eat from it you will certainly die.” Adam may have thought that this meant he would die before the sun set. But later that day, Jehovah spoke to Adam and Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:8-1:3:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 3:8</a>) As a righteous Judge, he first listened to what they had to say. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:9-1:3:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:9-13</a>) Then he condemned the two sinners to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:14-1:3:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 3:14-19</a>) If he had killed them right away, his purpose for humans would never come true. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>) Although the effects of sin began immediately, Jehovah allowed Adam and Eve to live long enough to have children who could have a better future. He viewed Adam and Eve as dead from the day they sinned. And since 1,000 years is like a day to Jehovah, they did die within one “day.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:8-61:3:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>How did Adam’s sin affect all his children? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Would the children of Adam and Eve be affected by what their parents did? Yes. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a> explains: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” The apostle Paul adds: “Through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 5:19</a>) Faithful Abel was the first to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:8-1:4:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 4:8</a>) Then Adam’s other children and his grandchildren grew old and died. Humans inherited sin and death, two enemies they cannot escape. Though we do not know exactly how sin and death were physically passed on to Adam’s children, we can see the results.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It makes sense that the Bible compares sin and death to a “covering that is woven over all the nations” and that is “enveloping all the peoples.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:25:7-23:25:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:7</a>) No human can escape sin and death. That is why the Bible says that “in Adam all are <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>dying.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:22-46:15:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>) So Paul asked the question: “Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:24-45:7:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 7:24</a>) Could anyone rescue Paul?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span><wbr />—See footnote.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Yes, Jehovah could rescue Paul.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30, 31</a>) But how would the human family be rescued from sin and death?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:16:1-4:16:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Numbers 16:1-11</a>) They had deceived themselves, thinking that Jehovah would accept their worship.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In Paul’s time, more than 1,500 years later, something similar happened in the Christian congregation. Paul explained that some who claimed to be Christians began to promote false teachings. Yet, they remained part of the congregation. These apostates may have appeared to be true worshippers of Jehovah. But in reality they were like dangerous wolves, and they even began to destroy “the faith of some.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:16-55:2:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:16-18</a>) Was Jehovah watching? Yes. Paul knew what God had done to the rebels, Korah and his supporters, so he was confident that Jehovah was fully aware of this situation as well. We too can have the same confidence in Jehovah. Let us learn how we can from the interesting words Paul wrote to Timothy.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What was Paul sure that Jehovah would do? What did Paul tell Timothy?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Paul was sure that Jehovah would recognize hypocritical worship. Also, he was sure that Jehovah knew who His true worshippers were. Paul’s confidence was shown by the words he was inspired to write to Timothy. After he described the harm that apostates were causing to the faith of some, Paul said: “Despite that, the solid foundation of God remains standing, having this seal, ‘Jehovah knows those who belong to him,’ and, ‘Let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What is interesting about Paul’s use of the expression “the solid foundation of God”? How would that affect Timothy?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Bible uses the word “foundation” to describe different things. These include Jerusalem, which was <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>the capital of ancient Israel, as well as Jesus’ role in God’s purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:87:1-19:87:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 87:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:11-46:3:11" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:6-60:2:6" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:6</a>) But the expression “the solid foundation of God” is used only once in the Bible. What event did Paul refer to when he used that expression?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When Paul used the expression “the solid foundation of God,” he did so in the same verse in which he quoted Moses’ words about Korah and his supporters. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:16:5-4:16:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Numbers 16:5</a>.) In this way, Paul was reminding Timothy that Jehovah knew what was happening in the congregation. God would prevent apostates from causing any harm. Jehovah’s purpose was not changed by Korah, and God’s purpose would not be changed by apostates in the congregation. Paul did not fully explain what was meant by “the solid foundation of God.” Still, what Paul said helped Timothy to have confidence and trust in Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s principles never change. “The decisions of Jehovah will stand forever; the thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:33:11-19:33:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 33:11</a>.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus’ early disciples courageously kept on witnessing about him. How was this possible? It was not because of their own strength. They asked Jehovah for his holy spirit to give them the courage they needed to keep on witnessing. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:30-44:5:32" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 5:30-32</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>About 27 years after Jesus’ disciples started witnessing, they had preached “the message of truth of the good news” to Jews and Gentiles “in all creation under heaven.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:5-51:1:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Colossians 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>More than 30 years before October 1914, anointed Christians began preaching that God’s Kingdom would begin to rule on that important date. Their understanding was based on Daniel’s prophecy about a large tree that was cut down and would grow again after a period of time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:4:16-27:4:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 4:16</a>) Jesus described a sign that would help his disciples know that he had become King and that the last days had begun.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>In 1914, when Jesus Christ became King, he started to free his anointed followers from “Babylon the Great,” that is, false religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 18:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 4</a>) In 1919, soon after World War I ended, the anointed had greater freedom to preach around the world. They witnessed about the saving power of the ransom and the good news of God’s Kingdom. As a result, thousands more learned the truth and were anointed to be kings with Christ in heaven.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In 1935, it was clear that Christ had already begun to gather his “other sheep.” Today, there are millions of these other sheep from all over the world. Along with the anointed, they follow Christ’s courageous example and witness to others. The other sheep too have faith that Jesus’ sacrifice is the only way they can have salvation. They know that if they endure in the witnessing work and use their lives to please Jehovah, they can survive “the great tribulation” and live in God’s new world.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

True, it is not always easy to continue doing this work. People may reject our message or even persecute us. If so, we can imitate the apostle Paul and his companions. Paul said: “We mustered up boldness by means of our God to tell you the good news of God in the face of much opposition.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:2-52:2:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>) We must keep the promise we made at our dedication.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Today, millions of people say that they are Christians, but they do what God hates and do not have his approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:1:16-56:1:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Titus 1:16</a>) In the first century, most people did not worship God in a way that he accepts. In fact, true Christians at that time were hated by many of the people around them. To encourage those Christians, the apostle Peter said: “If you are being <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>reproached for the name of Christ, you are happy.” Why could they be happy? Because they were approved by God and had his holy spirit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:14-60:4:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Are Jehovah’s Witnesses “reproached for the name of Christ” today? Yes, because not only do we witness about Jehovah but we also talk about Jesus and preach that he is the King of God’s Kingdom. Jesus too was persecuted because he was a witness of Jehovah. He told his opposers: “I have come in the name of my Father, but you do not receive me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:43-43:5:43" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 5:43</a>) So the next time people persecute you because you are witnessing, remember that God approves of you and that you have his holy spirit.</p>

Then we can help them to know Jehovah so that they can dedicate their lives to him and get baptized. How do you feel when you do this work? Sarie in South Africa, who has been a Witness of Jehovah for over 60 years, says: “I am deeply thankful that through Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, I can enjoy a good relationship with Jehovah, the Sovereign of the universe, and I am happy that I can make known his glorious name.” She and her husband, Martinus, have helped their three children and many other people to become worshippers of Jehovah.

“Maintain Your Conduct Fine Among the Nations”




 1. Why is it important for us to maintain good conduct during the upcoming conventions?
1 We attract the attention of the public during our conventions each year, so it is important that by our conduct we properly represent the God we worship. (Lev. 20:26) Our good manners as well as our dress and grooming should clearly identify us as Christ’s true followers. As we attend the upcoming district or international conventions, how can we ‘maintain our conduct fine among the nations’ and thus give glory to our heavenly Father?—1 Pet. 2:12.
 2. What opportunities to display the Christian personality will we have during the convention?
2 Display the Christian Personality: The love we show toward one another and the way we deal with “those on the outside” stand in stark contrast to the dominant spirit of the world. (Col. 3:10; 4:5; 2 Tim. 3:1-5) We should be kind and patient when dealing with hotel personnel and restaurant workers, even if problems arise. Good manners also dictate that we leave the customary tip for those providing personal services.
 3. What reminder is given to parents, and why?
3 Parents should closely supervise their children at the convention site, in restaurants, and at the hotel. (Prov. 29:15) The manager of one hotel restaurant said to a couple: “We just love you people. Your families and your children are so well-mannered and polite. All the staff were talking, and we wish that you were staying here every weekend.”
 4. While in the convention city, what attention should we give to our appearance?
4 Modest Dress: Our dress during the convention should be appropriate and modest, not reflecting the extreme styles common in the world. (1 Tim. 2:9) Even when checking in and out of the hotel and during times of leisure before and after the sessions, we want to avoid an overly casual or slovenly appearance. Thus we will be proud to wear our convention badge and not be embarrassed to give a witness when we have an opportunity. Our appearance and fine conduct while attending the upcoming conventions will not only attract honesthearted people to the Bible’s life-saving message but it will also bring joy to Jehovah.—Zeph. 3:17.



2014 Convention Reminders
▪ Program Times: The doors to the building will open at 8:00 a.m. The introductory music will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. At that time, all of us should go to our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The closing song and prayer will be introduced at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:50 p.m. on Sunday.
▪ International Conventions: Some areas will host international conventions. Keep in mind that the branch office has invited specific congregations and foreign delegates after carefully calculating the number of seats, parking spaces, and hotel rooms available. Overcrowding may occur if publishers attend an international convention to which they have not been invited. If circumstances require you to attend a convention other than the one to which you are assigned, you should not choose an international convention.
▪ Parking: At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking is usually limited, so carpooling should be done to the extent possible. Only those with a license plate or placard for the disabled will be allowed to park in the area reserved for such ones.
▪ Seat Saving: When the doors to the facility are opened each morning, please do not rush to the seating area of your preference as if competing with fellow attenders. A self-sacrificing spirit that moves us to seek the good of others identifies us as true Christians and moves onlookers to praise God. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5; 1 Pet. 2:12) Seats may be saved only for those living in your home or traveling in your vehicle or for your current Bible students. Special seating has been provided for the elderly and the infirm. Since this seating is limited, only one or two persons directly assisting the elderly or infirm individual may sit with him.
▪ Noon Meal: Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.
▪ Donations: We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations can also be made by means of a debit or credit card.
▪ Medication: If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention. Diabetic syringes and needles must be disposed of properly as hazardous waste and not in trash receptacles at the convention facility or hotel.
▪ Safety Precautions: Please be especially mindful of preventing potential injuries that can be caused by slipping and tripping. Each year injuries occur that are related to footwear, especially high-heeled shoes. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow you to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.
▪ Hearing Impaired: The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To hear it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.
▪ Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.
▪ Fragrances: Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in people with respiratory or related problems.—1 Cor. 10:24.
▪ Please Follow Up (S-43) Forms: A Please Follow Up form should be used to provide information regarding any interest found through informal witnessing during the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room or given to your congregation secretary on your return home.
▪ Restaurants: Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. Dress in a way that befits a Christian minister. Leave an appropriate tip if this is customary.
▪ Hotels:
Please do not reserve more rooms than you will actually use, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed.

Do not cancel your reservation except for an emergency situation, and notify the hotel as soon as it occurs so that others needing accommodations can use the room. (Matt. 5:37) If you do have to cancel your reservation, be sure to get a cancellation number. If you cancel a room less than 48 hours ahead of time, your deposit will not be refunded.

Please note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, it is standard practice for the hotel to place a hold on funds in your account to cover your total room cost, plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.

Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it.

If it is the custom in your country, tip hotel workers when they carry your luggage, and leave a tip for the housekeeper.

Cook only in rooms where cooking is permitted.

Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to consume while they are at the hotel by taking these items to the convention.

At all times, display the fruitage of the spirit when dealing with the hotel staff. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness.

Parents should supervise their children at all times around the hotel, including the elevators, swimming pool, lobby area, exercise room, and so forth.

The room rate shown on the Recommended Lodging List is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible.

If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so that they can assist you.


▪ Volunteer Service: Any who wish to volunteer should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent, guardian, or other adult approved by a parent or guardian.

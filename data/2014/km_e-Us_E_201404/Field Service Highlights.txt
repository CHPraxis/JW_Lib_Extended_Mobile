We are pleased to report that during the month of October 2013 there were three new all-time peaks in regular pioneers: 161,892 in the United States, 3,198 in Puerto Rico, and 57 in the Turks and Caicos Islands. What a fine example these pioneers display in focusing on Kingdom interests!—Matt. 6:22.

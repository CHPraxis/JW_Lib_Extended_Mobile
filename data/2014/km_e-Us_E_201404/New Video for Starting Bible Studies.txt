New Video for Starting Bible Studies




A brief video entitled Why Study the Bible? is reaching a vast audience on jw.org. The video is designed to motivate interested people to accept our offer of a free Bible study. It can be accessed by selecting “Request a Bible Study” at the bottom of the home page or by scanning the QR (quick response) code printed on the back of each of our new tracts. Here are some ways that we can make good use of the video.
  When making a return visit, say to the householder: “May I show you a short video that explains how you can get answers to your Bible questions?” If he agrees, show him the video on your mobile device or on his own computer.

  If we place one of the new tracts while engaging in informal or public witnessing, point out the QR code and encourage the person to scan it with his mobile device. Since in many languages the QR code takes you directly to the video on our Web site, it may be possible to play the video on the spot using your mobile device.

  Tell coworkers, schoolmates, relatives, and other acquaintances about the video, and offer to show it to them. Or e-mail them a link to the video, and invite them to view it on their own.


By making use of this new provision, we may be able to start more Bible studies, spiritually assisting those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”—Acts 13:48.

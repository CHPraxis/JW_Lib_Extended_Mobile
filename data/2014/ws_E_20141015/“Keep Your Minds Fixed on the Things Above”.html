He had left behind his comfortable life in the wealthy city of Ur and had traveled more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the land of Canaan.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Moses was another man who kept his mind fixed on the things above. He was raised as part of the royal family of Egypt at the time when Egypt was the most powerful nation in the world. The Bible says that he was “instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” This higher education made Moses “powerful in his words and deeds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:22-44:7:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 7:22</a>) Because of his background, Moses had many opportunities to be an important man in Egypt. But there was another kind of education that was more important to Moses.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>What education was most important to Moses? How do we know this?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When Moses was a child, his mother, Jochebed, taught him about the God of the Hebrews. This knowledge of Jehovah was more important to Moses than anything else.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Although Moses received the best education available in Egypt, he did not use it to become a powerful, famous, or rich man. In fact, the Bible says that he “refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.” Much later, Moses used his knowledge of Jehovah to lead His people.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>13, 14. </strong>(a) Before Moses could free Jehovah’s people, what did he need to learn? (b) What do we too need to learn?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Moses loved Jehovah and His people, who were slaves in Egypt at <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>that time. When Moses was 40 years old, he felt that he was ready to free them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:23-44:7:25" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 7:23-25</a>) But Jehovah knew that Moses was not ready to do this yet.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:33-20:15:33" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:33</a>) Moses needed training that would prepare him for the serious problems that were ahead. The 40 years Moses spent as a shepherd helped him to develop these qualities.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Did this practical training help Moses?

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Have Unshakable Faith in the Kingdom
▪  You Will Become “a Kingdom of Priests”
Jehovah will use the Messianic Kingdom to make his purpose for the earth and mankind come true. In these articles we will discuss how some of the covenants mentioned in the Bible are connected to that heavenly government. We will also learn why we can have unshakable faith in the Kingdom.

▪  Cherish Your Privilege of Working With Jehovah!
This article will consider both ancient and modern examples of people serving Jehovah. It will help us to cherish the privilege we have to be God’s fellow workers.

▪  “Keep Your Minds Fixed on the Things Above”
We live in critical times, so it is not easy to be faithful to Jehovah. This study, which includes the examples of Abraham and Moses, will teach us how to keep our minds fixed on Jehovah God and his Kingdom.

The unshakable foundation of this Kingdom is Jehovah’s absolute right to rule. Who is the King of this Kingdom? Who else will rule with this King? Who and what will be under their authority? Jehovah has legally established these important elements of the Kingdom through covenants. These covenants are legal contracts, or agreements, made by Jehovah or his Son, Jesus Christ.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>As stated in the book of Genesis, what decrees did Jehovah make that affect humans?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah prepared our earth so that humans could live on it. Then, Jehovah made the following decrees: (1) God would create humans in his image. (2) Humans would make the earth into a paradise and fill it with their righteous children. (3) Humans were not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2:16, 17</a>) These three decrees were a complete description of God’s purpose for man and the earth. So why did God have to make covenants?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>(a) How did Satan try to prevent God’s purpose from coming true? (b) How did Jehovah handle the rebellion in Eden?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Satan started a rebellion against God and his purpose. He focused on man’s obedience to God by tempting Eve to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>) By doing this, he challenged God’s right to rule over His creation. Later, Satan <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>also accused humans of worshipping God for selfish reasons.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:9-18:1:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:4-18:2:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How would Jehovah handle this rebellion? He could destroy the rebels. But that would mean that God’s purpose to fill the earth with Adam and Eve’s children would not succeed. Jehovah chose not to destroy the rebels. Instead, he gave a great prophecy, the <strong><em>Edenic promise. </em></strong>It guaranteed that every detail of God’s promises for the earth and for humans would come true.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">The Edenic promise guaranteed that every detail of God’s promises for the earth and for humans would come true</p>
</div>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What does the Edenic promise reveal about the serpent and its offspring?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>By means of the Edenic promise, God condemned to death the serpent and its offspring, that is, Satan the Devil and those who would take his side against God’s right to rule. God gave the offspring of the woman the authority to destroy these rebels. So the Edenic promise revealed that Satan and the effects of his rebellion would be eliminated. The promise also identified how this would be done.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What do we learn about the identity of the woman and her offspring?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Who would be the offspring of the woman? The offspring would have to be a spirit person. Why? Because this offspring will “bring to nothing” Satan, who is an invisible spirit creature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:2:14-58:2:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:14</a>) So the woman who gives birth to this offspring would also have to be invisible. While the serpent’s offspring multiplied, the identity of the woman and her offspring remained a mystery for about 4,000 years after the Edenic promise. During those years, Jehovah made several covenants that identify the offspring and reveal how God would repair the damage caused by Satan’s rebellion.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What is the Abrahamic covenant, and when did it become valid?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>About 2,000 years after the Edenic promise was made, Jehovah told Abraham to leave his home in the city of Ur and go to the land of Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:2-44:7:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 7:2, 3</a>) God told him: “Go out from your land and away from your relatives and from the house of your father to the land that I will show you. I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will become a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who calls down evil on you, and all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed by means of you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:12:1-1:12:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) God’s promise to Abraham <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>is called the <strong><em>Abrahamic covenant. </em></strong>We do not know exactly when Jehovah first made his covenant with Abraham. But we do know that the covenant became valid in the year 1943 before Christ, when Abraham, who was 75 years old, left Haran and crossed the Euphrates River.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>(a) How did Abraham prove that he had strong faith in God’s promises? (b) What details did Jehovah gradually reveal about the offspring of the woman?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah repeated his promise to Abraham several times and each time added more details. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:13:15-1:13:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 13:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:1-1:17:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 17:1-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:16-1:17:16" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 16</a>) Abraham’s faith in God’s promises was so strong that he was even willing to sacrifice his precious son. So Jehovah was moved to strengthen the covenant by guaranteeing that his promise would come true. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 22:15-18;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:17-58:11:18" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>Hebrews 11:17, 18</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>After the Abrahamic covenant became valid, Jehovah gradually revealed important details about the offspring of the woman. The offspring would come from Abraham’s family, would include many people, would serve as kings, would destroy all of God’s enemies, and would be a blessing for many humans.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The promises of the Abrahamic covenant first came true when Abraham’s descendants inherited the Promised Land.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The Abrahamic covenant provides a legal guarantee for the Kingdom of the heavens and opens the way for the King and his corulers to inherit that Kingdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-33</a>) In this way, Jehovah gave more specific information about the family line of the Messiah.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The Abrahamic covenant and the Davidic covenant guarantee that the offspring of the woman would rule as a king. But in order for all mankind to fully benefit, the offspring would need to be more than <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>just a king. The offspring would also need to be a priest. Only a priest can offer the sacrifice needed so that humans can be freed from sin and become part of Jehovah’s family of loyal servants in heaven and on earth. To make sure that the offspring would be a priest, Jehovah made another legal agreement, the <strong><em>covenant for a priest like Melchizedek.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>God revealed through King David that He would personally make a covenant with Jesus. That agreement involved two things: first, Jesus would “sit at [God’s] right hand” and have the authority to conquer all of his enemies; and second, Jesus would be “a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:1-19:110:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 110:1, 2,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:4-19:110:4" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> <strong>4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Why, though, would Jesus be a priest “in the manner of Melchizedek”? Before Abraham’s offspring conquered the Promised Land, Melchizedek was the king of the city of Salem and was a “priest of the Most High God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:1-58:7:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:1-3</a>) Jehovah directly appointed him as king and priest, and Melchizedek was the only person before Jesus to have both positions. Also, because there is no record of anyone having this position before or after Melchizedek, it is as if he is “a priest for all time,” or forever.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It upset Marilyn to think about what could happen if she left her precious family.

The elders and some others in her congregation warned her not to leave, but some sisters told her: “If you love your family, you’ll go. You can still serve Jehovah.” Even though she had doubts, Marilyn said good-bye to James and Jimmy and left for a job in another country. “I won’t be gone for long,” she promised.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why do many people move far away from their family? Who often raise the children of parents who move away?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah does not want his servants to starve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:25-19:37:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:30:8-20:30:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Proverbs 30:8</a>) Throughout history, Jehovah’s people have moved to get out of poverty. To avoid starvation, Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy food.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:42:1-1:42:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 42:1, 2</a>) In contrast, most who move today are not starving, so why do they move? Many are deeply in debt. Others may live in an area that has a poor economy. Because they want to have nicer things and live a more comfortable life, they may move away from their family to an area where it is easier to earn money. Parents who move away from home often leave their children to be raised by others, such as another parent, an older child, grandparents, other relatives, or friends. Even though it is painful to leave their family, many who move to work far away from home feel that they have no choice.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In Jesus’ day, many people were poor. They may have felt that if they had more money, they would be happier and more secure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:7-41:14:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 14:7</a>) But Jesus did not want them to trust in <strong>temporary </strong>things. He wanted them to <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>trust in Jehovah, whose blessings last <strong>forever. </strong>In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that real happiness and security come from our friendship with Jehovah, not from the things we have or from our own efforts.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">Real happiness and security do not come from the things we have</p>
</div>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In his model prayer, Jesus did not teach us to pray for a comfortable life. Instead, he taught us to pray for “our bread for <strong>this day.” </strong>Jesus clearly taught his listeners: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth.” He added: “Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:11-40:6:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:19-40:6:20" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) We can trust that Jehovah will bless us as he promises. God’s blessing includes more than his approval. It is a <strong>guarantee </strong>that he will give us everything we really need. The only way to have real happiness and security is to trust in our loving Father, Jehovah, instead of money.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:24-40:6:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:24, 25,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:31-40:6:34" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> <strong>31-34</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>(a) To whom has Jehovah given the responsibility to raise children? (b) Why do both parents need to help raise their children?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Doing God’s will includes taking care of our family responsibilities the way Jehovah wants us to. For example, the Law of Moses commanded parents to train their own children to serve Jehovah. Christians who want to please Jehovah must also do this. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>God has given this responsibility to parents, not to grandparents or anyone else. King Solomon said: “Listen, my son, to the discipline of your <strong>father, </strong>and do not forsake the instruction of your <strong>mother.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:1:8-20:1:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8</a>) Jehovah wants families to live together so that both parents can teach and guide their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:27-20:31:28" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 27, 28</a>) When children hear their parents talk about Jehovah and see how they serve him every day, children can learn to do the same.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Many who are thinking of leaving their family realize that their decision may create some problems. But it is impossible to know exactly how such a decision will affect your family.

Her husband and son suffered too. Young Jimmy kept asking her, “Why did you leave me?” Marilyn planned to be away for only a few months, but as years went by, it scared her to see how her family was changing. Jimmy was not the same boy she used to know. He talked to her less and less and was not willing to share his feelings anymore. Marilyn says, “His love for me went away.”</p>

The younger the children and the longer they are away from their parents, the more damage can be done. Marilyn explained to Jimmy that she was making a sacrifice to help him, but to Jimmy it seemed as if his mother had stopped loving him. In the beginning, he resented her absence. But later, when she visited him, he resented her presence. Similar to many children who are separated from their parents, Jimmy believed that his mother no longer had the right to be loved and obeyed.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 29:15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Marilyn’s relationship with Jehovah also suffered. She spent time with her congregation only one day a week or less. Her relationship with her husband suffered too. She had to fight off her boss who wanted to have sex with her. And because James and Marilyn could not talk about their problems with each other, they talked to others about their feelings and almost committed adultery. Marilyn realized that even though they did not commit adultery, their marriage was in danger. The Bible instructs married couples to care for each other’s emotional and sexual needs. Because Marilyn and James were so far apart, they could not give each other the private time and attention that a married couple should enjoy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/22:1:2-22:1:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:3-46:7:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 7:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:5-46:7:5" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 5</a>) And they could not worship Jehovah together with their son.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When Marilyn decided to return home, some gave her good advice and others gave her bad advice. The elders in her congregation commended her. Others tried to convince her to stay and told her that she could not earn enough money back home. “You’ll be back here in a short time,” they said. Instead of making such discouraging comments, Christians should “advise the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,” and to be “working at home,” or taking care of their <strong>own </strong>family. In this way, Christians will not bring shame on God’s name.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:3-56:2:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Titus 2:3-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Many who leave their family to work far away have grown up in cultures that honor traditions and relatives, especially parents, more than all else.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Consider Carin’s story: “When my son Don was born, my husband and I were working abroad, and I had recently begun to study the Bible.” Everyone in the family expected Carin to send Don to her parents until she and her husband could earn more money. When Carin said that she was going to raise Don herself, her relatives, including her husband, called her lazy and laughed at her. Carin said: “At the time, I could not fully understand what was wrong with leaving <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>Don with my parents for a few years. But I knew that Jehovah gave the job of raising our son to us<wbr />—his parents.” When she became pregnant again, her unbelieving husband demanded that she have an abortion. The good decision Carin made earlier had prepared her well, so she was able to make another decision that would please Jehovah. Today, she, her husband, and their children are all happy that they stayed together. If Carin had sent away one or both of her children to be raised by others, the result could have been very different.</p>

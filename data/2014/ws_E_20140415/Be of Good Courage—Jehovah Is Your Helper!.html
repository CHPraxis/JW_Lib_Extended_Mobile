I had not <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>been there to read them Bible stories, to pray with them, to cuddle them, and to play with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>) His oldest daughter, Anna, remembers: “I felt emotionally insecure not having our father at home with us.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The longer a father lives away from home, the more difficult it is for him to be a family head. Eduardo’s wife, Ruby, explains: “I had to play two roles<wbr />—Mom and Dad—<wbr />and I got used to making most of the family decisions. When Eduardo came home, I had to learn what Christian subjection really means. Even now, I sometimes have to remind myself that my husband is here.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:22-49:5:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:22, 23</a>) “The girls were used to going to their mother for permission to do things,” says Eduardo. “I had to learn to take the lead in a Christian way.” Eduardo and Ruby realized that their children needed to see that their parents make decisions together.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:18-62:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 3:18</a>) Did Jehovah bless Eduardo’s efforts? “Seeing all his efforts to be a good father and to draw close to us again made a big difference,” answers Anna. “When we saw him reaching out in the congregation, we felt proud. The world was trying to pull us away from Jehovah. But we saw our parents focused on the truth, so we tried to do the same. Papa promised never to leave us again, and he didn’t. If he had, I probably wouldn’t be in Jehovah’s organization today.”</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Children want their parents to be <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>with them. For example, when there was a war in the Balkans, many Witness parents were not able to go to work. As a result, they spent most of their time with their children at home. They played with them, talked with them, and studied with them. The children loved it, and they were happy even though life was very difficult during the war. The lesson? More than money or gifts, children really want their parents. As the Bible says, children will benefit when their parents spend time with them and train them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>.</p>

Their children may act as if they do not even care that they are back or as if they do not trust them anymore. The parent may say, “How can you be so ungrateful after all I have done for you?” But the truth is, the child is hurt because his parent left him. How can the parent fix the problem?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Ask Jehovah to help you to understand how your family really feels, and show them that you care. You also need to speak to your family and admit that you are part of the problem. A genuine apology may help. When your family sees that you keep trying to make things better, they will know that you are sincere. If you are patient and do not give up, your family may begin to love and respect you again.</p>

And there is no guarantee that they will make money once they get there. In fact, such a move can be dangerous. Many who leave their family return home with even more debt. Instead of being able to serve God more freely, they have to serve the people to whom they owe money. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:7-20:22:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 22:7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>It is always wise to avoid debt in the first place.</p>

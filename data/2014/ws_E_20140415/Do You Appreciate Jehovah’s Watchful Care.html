<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">IN MANY countries, the authorities have put up cameras to check the traffic and make recordings of accidents. They also record drivers who hit people walking on the road and who try to escape instead of helping the victims. The recordings help the authorities to find and arrest these ones. Because of all these cameras, it is becoming more difficult for criminals to get away with doing wrong.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Bible says that Jehovah’s eyes “are everywhere.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:3-20:15:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:3</a>) Does this mean that he constantly watches us only to see if we break his laws?

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>First, we will discuss the ways that Jehovah warns us before we do something bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>) For example, Cain “grew hot with anger” when Jehovah did not approve of him. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:3-1:4:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 4:3-7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah warned Cain that if he did not “turn to doing good,” he was going to sin. It was as if sin were “crouching at the door,” waiting to catch him. Jehovah asked him: “Will you get the mastery over it?” Jehovah wanted Cain to “be restored to favor.” If Cain listened to the warning, he would continue to have a good relationship with God.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>In what ways does Jehovah warn us?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The same is true with us today. Jehovah is able to see who we truly are on the inside. He knows our thoughts and desires, and we cannot hide anything from him. He loves us and wants us to do what is right, but he does not force us. So if he sees something bad in us, he warns us. How? When we read the Bible regularly, when we read our publications, and when we attend meetings, we are able to hear God’s warnings. Have you ever read or heard something that helped you overcome a problem that only Jehovah knew about? These warnings from Jehovah come exactly when we need them.</p>

It is true that the Bible, our publications, and our meetings benefit millions of people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:11</a>) But when someone gives us counsel from the Bible, it is very important to understand why he does this. He does not do so because he wants to hurt our feelings but because he sees that our relationship with Jehovah is in danger. He is willing to take the time and to make the effort to show us from the Bible how we can return to Jehovah. We respect this counsel because its Source is Jehovah.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>) It became evident that the old desire for pornography was still burning within him, like the coals of a fire. One day, he lent his phone to an elder, and the pornographic sites appeared on the phone. The elder immediately counseled the brother. The brother listened to the counsel and eventually overcame this <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>bad habit.

They were shocked and later found out that someone had falsely accused them of dishonesty. The brother was worried about where they would live. But he had confidence in Jehovah and said: “Jehovah will provide. He always cares for our needs, no matter what happens.” The family followed Bible principles, and they were respectful and peaceful despite the accusations. A few days later, the owner of the farm told them that they could stay.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>As servants of Jehovah, we face many trials, and some of them may seem to last for a long time, such as illness, persecution, or opposition from family members. One of the most difficult things to endure is a serious disagreement with someone in the congregation because of personality differences.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>For example, what a brother says may really hurt you. You might think: ‘This should not happen in God’s organization!’ Yet the brother who hurt you is given more responsibilities in <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>the congregation, and others think that he is wonderful. You might ask: ‘How can this be? Does Jehovah not see?

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Why might Jehovah allow our brothers to give us strong counsel?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah sees much more than we see, and he may allow a situation for important reasons. For example, someone may give us counsel that we do not feel we deserve, and our feelings are hurt. But God may see the situation differently. Is it possible that we did deserve the counsel after all? In his life story, Brother Karl Klein said that Brother Rutherford once gave him strong counsel. Some time later, when Brother Rutherford greeted him cheerfully, Brother Klein barely responded. Brother Rutherford saw that Brother Klein was still hurting from the counsel. Brother Rutherford warned Brother Klein: “Just watch out. The Devil’s after you.” This advice really helped Brother Klein. When he later became a member of the Governing Body, he said that he had learned that our brothers have the right to counsel us and that if we hate them for this, the Devil will catch us.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span><wbr />—See footnote.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>We want trials to end quickly. But it is important that we learn to be patient. Trials can be compared to being stuck in traffic when you are driving on a busy road. You could patiently stay on the road until the traffic starts to move. Instead, you become impatient and decide to find another road. But then you get lost and arrive late at your destination. If you had been patient and had stuck to your original route, you probably would have arrived on time. It is similar when we face trials. If we are patient and follow Bible principles, Jehovah will help us endure.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Jehovah may allow trials because he wants us to be trained by them. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:6-60:5:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 5:6-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We must never think that God causes our trials.

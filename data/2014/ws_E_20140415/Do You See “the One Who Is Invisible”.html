<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>(a) Explain why Moses seemed to be in danger. (See opening picture.) (b) Why did Moses not fear the anger of the king?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">PHARAOH was a powerful ruler, and the Egyptians worshipped him as a god. The book <em>When Egypt Ruled the East </em>says that to the Egyptians, he was greater than any other earthly creature “in wisdom and power.” Pharaoh wanted the Egyptians to fear him, so he wore a crown with the image of a cobra ready to attack. This image was a reminder that the king’s enemies would quickly be destroyed. So imagine how Moses felt when Jehovah told him: “I will send you to Pharaoh, and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:10-2:3:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 3:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Moses went to Egypt and told Pharaoh about God’s message. That made Pharaoh very angry. After Egypt was punished with nine plagues, Pharaoh was so angry that he warned Moses: “Make sure that you do not try to see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:10:28-2:10:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 10:28</a>) Moses left, but before that, he <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>prophesied that the king’s firstborn son would die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:11:4-2:11:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 11:4-8</a>) Moses then told every Israelite family to slaughter a goat or a male sheep and to splash its blood on their doorways. The male sheep was a sacred animal to the Egyptian god Ra. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:5-2:12:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 12:5-7</a>) How would Pharaoh react? Moses was not afraid of Pharaoh’s reaction. Why not? Because he had faith and obeyed Jehovah, “not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.”<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:27-58:11:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 11:27, 28</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>When Moses appeared before Pharaoh, what may those without faith have thought?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Those without faith may have thought that Moses was powerless against mighty Pharaoh. Moses’ life and future were in Pharaoh’s hands. Even Moses himself asked Jehovah: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:11-2:3:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 3:11</a>) About 40 years earlier, Moses had run from Egypt as a fugitive. He may have wondered, ‘Is it really a good idea for me to go back to Egypt and risk making the king angry?’</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What helped Moses to fear Jehovah, not Pharaoh?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>God taught Moses an important lesson before he returned to Egypt. Moses later wrote about that lesson in the book of Job: “The fear of Jehovah<wbr />—that is wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:28:28-18:28:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 28:28</a>) To help Moses learn proper fear and act wisely, Jehovah compared humans with himself, the almighty God. He asked: <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“Who made a mouth for man, or who makes them speechless, deaf, clear-sighted, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:11-2:4:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 4:11</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>What was the lesson? Moses was sent by Jehovah, so he did not need to be afraid. God would give Moses the power to tell God’s message to Pharaoh. And this was not the first time God’s servants had been in danger in Egypt. Perhaps Moses remembered how Jehovah had protected Abraham, Joseph, and even Moses himself from other Pharaohs who ruled in the past. Pharaoh was powerless against Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:12:17-1:12:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 12:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:41:14-1:41:14" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 41:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:41:39-1:41:41" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 39-41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:22-2:2:10" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Exodus 1:22–2:10</a>) Because Moses saw “the One who is invisible,” he courageously went to Pharaoh and told him every word of Jehovah’s message.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How did faith in Jehovah protect one sister?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Faith in Jehovah also protected a sister named Ella from giving in to fear of man. In 1949 she was arrested in Estonia by the KGB. They took all her clothes off, and then young police officers stared at her. “I felt humiliated,” she said. “Yet, after I prayed to Jehovah, peace and calmness of heart came over me.” Then Ella was left alone in a small, dark cell for three days. She says: “The officials shouted: ‘We are going to make it so that even the name Jehovah will not be remembered in Estonia! You are going to a camp, and the others are going to Siberia!’ Tauntingly, they added, ‘Where is your Jehovah?’” Would Ella fear men or trust in Jehovah? When interrogated, she was not afraid to tell them: “I have given this matter much thought, and I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God intact than be free and lose his approval.” Jehovah was just as real to Ella as the men standing in front of her. She remained loyal to Jehovah because she had faith in him.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In the month of Nisan 1513 before Christ, Jehovah instructed Moses and Aaron to tell the Israelites to take a healthy male sheep or goat, slaughter it, and splash its blood on their doorways.

We are also convinced that the preaching work is just as urgent as Jehovah says it is.

We preach because we love Jehovah and because we love our neighbor. In his illustration of the Samaritan, Jesus taught us to understand what it really means to show love and mercy. We might ask ourselves: ‘Am I like the Samaritan, or am I like the priest and the Levite?

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Moses’ faith in “the One who is invisible” helped him when the Israelites were in danger after they left Egypt. The Bible says: “The Israelites raised their eyes and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. The Israelites became terrified and began to cry out to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:14:10-2:14:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Exodus 14:10-12</a>) The Israelites should have <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>expected this situation. Jehovah had foretold: “I will allow Pharaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he will chase after them, and I will glorify myself by means of Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:14:4-2:14:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Exodus 14:4</a>) Despite Jehovah’s warning, the Israelites had no faith. They could see only the Red Sea blocking the way in front of them, Pharaoh’s war chariots approaching quickly behind them, and an 80-year-old shepherd leading them. They felt trapped.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>How did faith strengthen Moses at the Red Sea?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Moses was not afraid. His eyes of faith saw something much more powerful than a sea or an army. He could “see the salvation of Jehovah,” and he knew that Jehovah would fight for the Israelites. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:14:13-2:14:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 14:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Moses’ faith strengthened and encouraged God’s people.

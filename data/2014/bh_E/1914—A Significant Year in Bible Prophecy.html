<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">DECADES in advance, Bible students proclaimed that there would be significant developments in 1914. What were these, and what evidence points to 1914 as such an important year?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>, Jesus said: “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the <span id="page216" class="pageNum" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span>nations [“the times of the Gentiles,” <em>King James Version</em>] are fulfilled.” Jerusalem had been the capital city of the Jewish nation​—the seat of rulership of the line of kings from the house of King David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:48:1-19:48:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 48:1, 2</a>) However, these kings were unique among national leaders. They sat on “Jehovah’s throne” as representatives of God himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>) Jerusalem was thus a symbol of Jehovah’s rulership.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How and when, though, did God’s rulership begin to be “trampled on by the nations”? This happened in 607 B.C.E. when Jerusalem was conquered by the Babylonians. “Jehovah’s throne” became vacant, and the line of kings who descended from David was interrupted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:1-12:25:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Kings 25:1-26</a>) Would this ‘trampling’ go on forever? No, for the prophecy of Ezekiel said regarding Jerusalem’s last king, Zedekiah: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown. . . . It will not belong to anyone until the one who has the legal right comes, and I <span id="page217" class="pageNum" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>will give it to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:26-26:21:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:26, 27</a>) “The one who has the legal right” to the Davidic crown is Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) So the ‘trampling’ would end when Jesus became King.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When would that grand event occur? Jesus showed that the Gentiles would rule for a fixed period of time. The account in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:1-27:4:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel chapter 4</a> holds the key to knowing how long that period would last. It relates a prophetic dream experienced by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He saw a tree of enormous height that was chopped down. Its stump could not grow because it was banded with iron and copper. An angel declared: “Let <em>seven times </em>pass over it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:10-27:4:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 4:10-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Bible, trees are sometimes used to represent rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:22-26:17:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:22-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:31:2-26:31:5" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 31:2-5</a>) So the chopping down of the symbolic tree represents how God’s rulership, as expressed through the kings at Jerusalem, would be interrupted. However, the vision served notice that this ‘trampling of Jerusalem’ would be temporary​—a period of “seven times.” How long a period is that?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:6-66:12:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:14-66:12:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14</a> indicates that three and a half times equal “1,260 days.” “Seven times” would therefore last twice as long, or 2,520 days. But the Gentile nations did not stop ‘trampling’ on God’s rulership a mere 2,520 days after Jerusalem’s fall. Evidently, then, this prophecy covers a much longer period of time. On the basis of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:34-4:14:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Numbers 14:34</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:6-26:4:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, which speak of “a day for a year,” the “seven times” would cover 2,520 <em>years.</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The 2,520 years began in October 607 B.C.E., when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians and the Davidic king was taken off his throne. The period ended in October 1914. At that time, “the appointed times of the nations” ended, and Jesus Christ was installed as God’s heavenly King.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:1-19:2:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Daniel 7:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page218" class="pageNum" data-no="218" data-before-text="218"></span>Just as Jesus predicted, his “presence” as heavenly King has been marked by dramatic world developments​—war, famine, earthquakes, pestilences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Luke 21:11</a>) Such developments bear powerful testimony to the fact that 1914 indeed marked the birth of God’s heavenly Kingdom and the beginning of “the last days” of this present wicked system of things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p12" data-pid="12">From October 607 B.C.E. to October 1 B.C.E. is 606 years. Since there is no zero year, from October 1 B.C.E. to October 1914 C.E. is 1,914 years. By adding 606 years and 1,914 years, we get 2,520 years.

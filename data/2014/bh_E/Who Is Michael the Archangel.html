<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE spirit creature called Michael is not mentioned often in the Bible. However, when he is referred to, he is in action. In the book of Daniel, Michael is battling wicked angels; in the letter of Jude, he is disputing with Satan; and in Revelation, he is waging war with the Devil and his demons. By defending Jehovah’s rulership and fighting God’s enemies, Michael lives up to the meaning of his name​—“Who Is Like God?” But who is Michael?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At times, individuals are known by more than one name. For example, the patriarch Jacob is also known as Israel, and the apostle Peter, as Simon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:1-1:49:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 49:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:2-40:10:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Matthew 10:2</a>) Likewise, the Bible indicates that Michael is another name for Jesus Christ, before and after his life on earth. Let us consider Scriptural reasons for drawing that conclusion.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Archangel. </em>God’s Word refers to Michael “the archangel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jude 9</a>) This term means “chief angel.” Notice that Michael is called <em>the </em>archangel. This suggests that there is only one such angel. In fact, the term “archangel” occurs in the Bible only in the singular, never in the plural. Moreover, Jesus is linked with the office of archangel. Regarding the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:16-52:4:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> states: “The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice.” Thus the voice of Jesus is described as being that of an archangel. This scripture <span id="page219" class="pageNum" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>therefore suggests that Jesus himself is the archangel Michael.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Army Leader. </em>The Bible states that “Michael and <em>his </em>angels battled with the dragon . . . and its angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7</a>) Thus, Michael is the Leader of an army of faithful angels. Revelation also describes Jesus as the Leader of an army of faithful angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:14-66:19:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 19:14-16</a>) And the apostle Paul specifically mentions “the Lord Jesus” and “his powerful angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:7-53:1:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>) So the Bible speaks of both Michael and “his angels” and Jesus and “his angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:41-40:13:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 13:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:27-40:16:27" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 24:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:22-60:3:22" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:22</a>) Since God’s Word nowhere indicates that there are two armies of faithful angels in heaven​—one headed by Michael and one headed by Jesus—​it is logical to conclude that Michael is none other than Jesus Christ in his heavenly role.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

Jesus Christ​—The Promised Messiah




TO HELP us identify the Messiah, Jehovah God inspired many Bible prophets to provide details about the birth, the ministry, and the death of this promised Deliverer. All these Bible prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. They are amazingly accurate and detailed. To illustrate this, let us consider a few prophecies that foretold events related to the Messiah’s birth and childhood.
The prophet Isaiah foretold that the Messiah would be a descendant of King David. (Isaiah 9:7) Jesus was indeed born in David’s line.​—Matthew 1:1, 6-17.
Micah, another prophet of God, foretold that this child would eventually become a ruler and that he would be born in “Bethlehem Ephrathah.” (Micah 5:2) At the time of Jesus’ birth, there were two towns in Israel that were named Bethlehem. One was situated near Nazareth in the northern region of the country, and the other, near Jerusalem in Judah. Bethlehem near Jerusalem was formerly called Ephrathah. Jesus was born in that town, exactly as the prophecy foretold!​—Matthew 2:1.
Another Bible prophecy foretold that the Son of God would be called “out of Egypt.” The child Jesus was taken into Egypt. He was brought back after the death of Herod, thus fulfilling the prophecy.​—Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15.
In the chart entitled “Prophecies Regarding the Messiah,” the scriptures listed under the heading “Prophecy” contain details concerning the Messiah. Please compare these with the scriptures listed under the heading “Fulfillment.” Doing so will further strengthen your faith in the truthfulness of God’s Word.
While you examine these scriptures, keep in mind that those of a prophetic nature were written down hundreds of years before Jesus’ birth. Jesus stated: “All the things written about me in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms must be fulfilled.” (Luke 24:44) As you can verify in your own copy of the Bible, fulfilled they were​—in every detail!

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb">HAVE you watched the news on television and wondered, ‘What is this world coming to?’ Tragic things happen so suddenly and unexpectedly that no human can predict what tomorrow will bring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:14-59:4:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 4:14</a>) However, Jehovah knows what the future holds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10</a>) Long ago his Word, the Bible, foretold not only the bad things happening in our day but also the wonderful things that will occur in the near future.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">2, 3. What question did the disciples ask Jesus, and how did he reply?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jesus Christ spoke about the Kingdom of God, which will bring an end to wickedness and make the earth a paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) People wanted to know when the Kingdom would come. In fact, Jesus’ disciples asked him: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>) In reply Jesus told them that only Jehovah God knew exactly when the end of this system of things would come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 24:36</a>) <span id="page87" class="pageNum" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>But Jesus did foretell things that would take place on earth just before the Kingdom would bring true peace and security to mankind. What he foretold is now taking place!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Before we examine the evidence that we are living in “the conclusion of the system of things,” let us briefly consider a war that no human could possibly have observed. It took place in the invisible spirit realm, and its outcome affects us.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>A WAR IN HEAVEN</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">4, 5. (a) What took place in heaven soon after Jesus was enthroned as King? (b) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>, what was to be the result of the war in heaven?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The preceding chapter in this book explained that Jesus Christ became King in heaven in the year 1914. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 7:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Soon after he received Kingdom power, Jesus took action. “War broke out in heaven,” says the Bible. “Michael [another name for Jesus] and his angels battled with the dragon [Satan the Devil], and the dragon and its angels battled.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Satan and his wicked angels, the demons, lost that war and were cast out of heaven to the earth. God’s faithful spirit sons rejoiced that Satan and his demons were gone. Humans, however, would experience no such joy. Instead, the Bible foretold: “Woe for the earth . . . because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Please notice what would result from the war in heaven. In his fury, Satan would bring woe, or trouble, upon those on earth. As you will see, we are now living in that <span id="page88" class="pageNum" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>time of woe. But it will be relatively brief​—only “a short period of time.” Even Satan realizes that. The Bible refers to this period as “the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) How glad we can be that God will soon do away with the Devil’s influence over the earth! Let us consider some of the things foretold in the Bible that are happening right now. These prove that we are living in the last days and that God’s Kingdom will soon bring everlasting blessings to those who love Jehovah. First, let us examine four features of the sign that Jesus said would mark the time in which we live.</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST DAYS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">6, 7. How are Jesus’ words about wars and food shortages being fulfilled today?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>“Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) Millions of people have been killed in wars during the past century. One British historian wrote: “The 20th century was the most murderous in recorded history. . . . It was a century of almost unbroken war, with few and brief periods without organised armed conflict somewhere.” A report from the Worldwatch Institute states: “Three times as many people fell victim to <span id="page89" class="pageNum" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>war in [the 20th] century as in all the wars from the first century AD to 1899.” More than 100 million people have died as a result of wars since 1914. Even if we know the sorrow of losing <em>one </em>loved one in warfare, we can only imagine such misery and pain multiplied <em>millions </em>of times over.</p>

</div>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>“There will be food shortages.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) Researchers say that food production has increased greatly during the past 30 years. Nevertheless, food shortages continue because many people do not have enough money to buy food or land on which to raise crops. In developing countries, well over a billion people have to live on an income of a dollar or less a day. The majority of these suffer from chronic hunger. The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition plays a major role in the deaths of more than five million children each year.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">8, 9. What shows that Jesus’ prophecies about earthquakes and pestilences have come true?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>“There will be great earthquakes.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an average of 19 major earthquakes are expected per year. These are powerful enough <span id="page90" class="pageNum" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>to damage buildings and crack the ground. And on an average, earthquakes strong enough to cause total destruction of buildings have occurred yearly. Available records show that earthquakes have claimed over two million lives since 1900. One source states: “Improvements in technology have only slightly reduced the death toll.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>“There will be . . . pestilences.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) Despite medical advances, old and new diseases plague mankind. One report says that 20 well-known diseases​—including tuberculosis, malaria, and cholera—​have become more common in recent decades, and some types of disease are increasingly difficult to cure by means of drugs. In fact, at least 30 new diseases have appeared. Some of them have no known cure and are fatal.</p>

They have grown in appreciation of precious truths about God’s name and purpose, the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the condition of the dead, and the resurrection. Moreover, worshippers of Jehovah have learned how to live their lives in a way that benefits them and brings praise to God. They have also gained a clearer understanding of the role of God’s Kingdom and how it will set matters straight on the earth. What do they do with this knowledge?

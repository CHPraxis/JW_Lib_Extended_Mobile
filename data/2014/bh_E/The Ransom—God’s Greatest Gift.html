<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">WHAT is the greatest gift you have ever received? A gift does not have to be expensive to be important. After all, the true value of a gift is not necessarily measured in terms of money. Rather, when a gift brings you happiness or fills a real need in your life, it has great value to you personally.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Of the many gifts you could ever hope to receive, there is one that stands out above all others. It is a gift from God to mankind. Jehovah has given us many things, but his greatest gift to us is the ransom sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 20:28</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As we will see in this chapter, the ransom is the most valuable gift you could possibly receive, for it can bring you untold happiness and can fill your most important needs. The ransom is really the greatest expression of Jehovah’s love for you.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 3. What is the ransom, and what do we need to understand in order to appreciate this valuable gift?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Put simply, the ransom is Jehovah’s means to deliver, or save, humankind from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:7</a>) To grasp the meaning of this Bible teaching, we need to think back to what happened in the garden of Eden. Only if we understand what Adam lost when he sinned can we appreciate why the ransom is such a valuable gift to us.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4. What did perfect human life mean for Adam?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When he created Adam, Jehovah gave him something truly precious​—perfect human life. Consider what that meant for Adam. Made with a perfect body and mind, he would never get sick, grow old, or die. As a perfect human, he had a special relationship with Jehovah. The Bible says that Adam was a “son of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>) So Adam enjoyed a close relationship with Jehovah God, like that of a son with a loving father. Jehovah communicated with his earthly son, giving Adam satisfying assignments of work and letting him know what was expected of him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5. What does the Bible mean when it says that Adam was made “in God’s image”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Adam was made “in God’s image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) That did not mean that Adam resembled God in appearance. As we learned in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005131/">Chapter 1</a> of this book, Jehovah is an invisible Spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) So Jehovah does not have a body of flesh and blood. Being made in God’s image meant that Adam was created with qualities like those of God, including love, wisdom, justice, and power. Adam was like his Father in another important way in that he possessed free will. Hence, Adam was not like <span id="page49" class="pageNum" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>a machine that can perform only what it is designed or programmed to do. Instead, he could make personal decisions, choosing between right and wrong. If he had chosen to obey God, he would have lived forever in Paradise on earth.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 6. When Adam disobeyed God, what did he lose, and how were his offspring affected?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Clearly, then, when Adam disobeyed God and was condemned to death, he paid a very high price. His sin cost him his perfect human life with all its blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) Sadly, Adam lost this precious life not only for himself but also for his future offspring. God’s Word says: “Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Yes, all of us have inherited sin from Adam. Hence, the Bible says that he “sold” himself and his offspring into slavery to sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:14-45:7:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 7:14</a>) There was no hope for Adam or Eve because they willfully chose to disobey God. But what about their offspring, including us?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">7, 8. A ransom basically involves what two things?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah came to mankind’s rescue by means of the ransom. What is a ransom? The idea of a ransom basically involves two things. First, a ransom is the price paid to bring about a release or to buy something back. It might be compared to the price paid for the release of a prisoner of war. Second, a ransom is the price that covers, or pays, the cost of something. It is similar to the price paid to cover the damages caused by an injury. For example, if a person causes an accident, he would have to pay an amount that fully corresponds to, or equals, the value of what was damaged.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page50" class="pageNum" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>How would it be possible to cover the enormous loss that Adam inflicted on all of us and to release us from slavery to sin and death? Let us consider the ransom that Jehovah provided and what this can mean for you.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Since a perfect human life was lost, no imperfect human life could ever buy it back. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:7-19:49:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>) What was needed was a ransom equal in value to what was lost. This is in harmony with the principle of perfect justice found in God’s Word, which says: “Life will be for life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:21-5:19:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>) So, what would cover the value of the perfect human soul, or life, that Adam lost? Another perfect human life was the “corresponding ransom” that was required.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">10. How did Jehovah provide the ransom?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah provide the ransom? He sent one of his perfect spirit sons to the earth. But Jehovah did not send just any spirit creature. He sent the one most precious to him, his only-begotten Son. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 4:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Willingly, this Son left his heavenly home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:7-50:2:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Philippians 2:7</a>) As we learned in the preceding chapter of this book, Jehovah performed a miracle when he transferred the life of this Son to the womb of Mary. By means of God’s holy spirit, Jesus was born as a perfect human and was not under the penalty of sin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>How could one man serve as a ransom for many, in fact, millions of humans? Well, how did humans numbering into the millions come to be sinners in the first <span id="page51" class="pageNum" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>place? Recall that by sinning, Adam lost the precious possession of perfect human life. Hence, he could not pass it on to his offspring. Instead, he could pass on only sin and death. Jesus, whom the Bible calls “the last Adam,” had a perfect human life, and he never sinned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) In a sense, Jesus stepped into Adam’s place in order to save us. By sacrificing, or giving up, his perfect life in flawless obedience to God, Jesus paid the price for Adam’s sin. Jesus thus brought hope to Adam’s offspring.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:22" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">12. What was proved by Jesus’ suffering?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The Bible describes in detail the suffering that Jesus endured before his death. He was whipped and nailed to the torture stake, suffering an agonizing death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:1-43:19:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 19:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:16-43:19:18" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 16-18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:30-43:19:30" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 30</a>; Appendix article, “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005154/">Why True Christians Do Not Use the Cross in Worship</a>”) Why was it necessary for Jesus to suffer so much? In a later chapter of this book, we will see that Satan has questioned whether Jehovah has any human servants who would remain faithful under trial. By enduring faithfully in spite of great suffering, Jesus gave the best possible answer to Satan’s challenge. Jesus proved that a perfect man possessing free will could keep perfect integrity to God no matter what the Devil did. Jehovah must have rejoiced greatly over the faithfulness of his dear Son!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>How was the ransom paid? On the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan in 33 C.E., God allowed his perfect and sinless Son to be executed.

In heaven, Jesus presented to God the <span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>value of his perfect human life sacrificed as a ransom in exchange for Adam’s offspring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:24</a>) Jehovah accepted the value of Jesus’ sacrifice as the ransom needed to deliver mankind from slavery to sin and death.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 3:23, 24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The forgiveness of sins. </em>Because of inherited imperfection, we have a real struggle to do what is right. All of us sin either in word or in deed.

We must also humbly appeal to Jehovah, asking his forgiveness on the basis of our faith in the ransom sacrifice of his Son.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 1:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>A clean conscience before God. </em>A guilty conscience can easily lead to hopelessness and make us feel worthless. Through the forgiveness made possible by the ransom, though, Jehovah kindly enables us to worship him with a clean conscience despite our imperfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:13-58:9:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:13, 14</a>) This makes it possible for us to have freeness of speech with Jehovah.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Why should we be deeply grateful to Jehovah for the ransom? Well, a gift is especially precious when it involves a sacrifice of time, effort, or expense on the part of the giver. Our heart is touched when we see that a gift is an expression of the giver’s genuine love for us. The ransom is the most precious of all gifts, for God made the greatest sacrifice ever in providing it. “God loved <span id="page55" class="pageNum" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.

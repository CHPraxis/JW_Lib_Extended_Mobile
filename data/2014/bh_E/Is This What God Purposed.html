<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">READ any newspaper. Look at television, or listen to the radio. There are so many stories of crime, war, and terrorism! Think about your own troubles. Perhaps illness or the death of a loved one is causing you great distress. You may feel like the good man Job, who said that he was “filled with dishonor and affliction.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:15-18:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 10:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">           Is this what God purposed for me and for the rest of mankind?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">           Where can I find help to cope with my problems?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">           Is there any hope that we will ever see peace on the earth?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible provides satisfying answers to these questions.</p>

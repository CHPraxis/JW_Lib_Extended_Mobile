<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">IMAGINE that you are running away from a vicious enemy. He is much stronger and faster than you are. You know that he is merciless because you have seen him kill some of your friends. No matter how hard you try to outrun him, he keeps getting closer. There seems to be no hope. Suddenly, though, a rescuer appears at your side. He is far more powerful than your enemy, and he promises to help you. How relieved that makes you feel!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In a sense, you <em>are </em>being pursued by such an enemy. All of us are. As we learned in the preceding chapter, the Bible calls death an enemy. None of us can outrun it or fight it off. Most of us have seen this enemy claim the lives of people dear to us. But Jehovah is far more powerful than death. He is the loving Rescuer who has already shown that he can defeat this enemy. And he promises to destroy this enemy, death, once and for all. The Bible teaches: “The last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>) That is good news!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span id="page67" class="pageNum" data-no="67" data-before-text="67"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Let us take a brief look at how the enemy death affects us when it strikes. Doing this will help us to appreciate something that will make us happy. You see, Jehovah promises that the dead will live again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:19-23:26:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:19</a>) They will be brought back to life. That is the hope of the resurrection.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 4. (a) Why does Jesus’ reaction to the death of a loved one teach us about Jehovah’s feelings? (b) Jesus developed what special friendship?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Have you lost a loved one in death? The pain, the grief, and the feelings of helplessness can seem unbearable. At such times, we need to go to God’s Word for comfort. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Bible helps us to understand how Jehovah and Jesus feel about death. Jesus, who perfectly reflected his Father, knew the pain of losing someone in death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) When he was in Jerusalem, Jesus used to visit Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, who lived in the nearby town of Bethany. They became close friends. The Bible says: “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:5-43:11:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 11:5</a>) As we learned in the preceding chapter, though, Lazarus died.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">5, 6. (a) How did Jesus respond when he was with Lazarus’ grieving family and friends? (b) Why is Jesus’ grief encouraging to us?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did Jesus feel about losing his friend? The account tells us that Jesus joined Lazarus’ relatives and friends as they grieved over this loss. Seeing them, Jesus was deeply moved. He “groaned within himself and became troubled.” Then, the account says, “Jesus gave way to tears.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:33-43:11:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 11:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:35-43:11:35" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 35</a>) Did Jesus’ grief mean that he had no hope? Not at all. In fact, Jesus knew that something wonderful was about to happen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:3-43:11:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 11:3, 4</a>) Still, he felt the pain and sorrow that death brings.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In a way, Jesus’ grief is encouraging to us. It teaches <span id="page68" class="pageNum" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>us that Jesus and his Father, Jehovah, hate death. But Jehovah God is able to fight and overcome that enemy! Let us see what God enabled Jesus to do.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Lazarus had been buried in a cave, and Jesus asked that the stone sealing its entrance be taken away.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jesus did not claim to perform this amazing miracle on his own. In his prayer just before calling out to Lazarus, he made it clear that Jehovah was the Source of the resurrection. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:41-43:11:42" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:41, 42</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This was not the only time that Jehovah used his power in this way. The resurrection of Lazarus is just one of nine miracles of this kind recorded in God’s Word.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> To read and study <span id="page70" class="pageNum" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>these accounts is a delight. They teach us that God is not partial, for the resurrected ones include young and old, male and female, Israelite and non-Israelite. And what joy is described in these passages! For example, when Jesus raised a young girl from the dead, her parents “were beside themselves with great ecstasy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:42-41:5:42" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 5:42</a>) Yes, Jehovah had given them a cause for joy that they would never forget.</p>

<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>LEARNING FROM THE RESURRECTION ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">11. How does the account of Lazarus’ resurrection help to confirm the truth recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The Bible teaches that “the dead know nothing at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>) They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he knew “nothing at all.” Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 11:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">12. Why can we be sure that the resurrection of Lazarus really happened?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. Rather, they said: “What are we to do, for this man [Jesus] performs many signs?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:47-43:11:47" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 11:47</a>) Many people went to see the resurrected man. As a result, even more of them <span id="page71" class="pageNum" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>put faith in Jesus. They saw in Lazarus living proof that Jesus was sent by God. This evidence was so powerful that some of the hardhearted Jewish religious leaders planned to kill both Jesus and Lazarus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:53-43:11:53" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 11:53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:9-43:12:11" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 12:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">13. What basis do we have for believing that Jehovah really can resurrect the dead?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Is it unrealistic to accept the resurrection as a fact? No, for Jesus taught that someday “all those in the memorial tombs” will be resurrected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 5:28</a>) Jehovah is the Creator of all life. Should it be hard to believe that he can re-create life? Of course, much would depend on Jehovah’s memory. Can he remember our dead loved ones? Countless trillions of stars fill the universe, yet God knows the name of each one! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>) So Jehovah God can remember our dead loved ones in every detail, and he is ready to restore them to life.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">14, 15. As illustrated by what Job said, how does Jehovah feel about bringing the dead back to life?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>How, though, does Jehovah feel about resurrecting the dead? The Bible teaches that he is eager to raise the dead. The faithful man Job asked: “If a man dies, can he live again?” Job was speaking about waiting in the grave until the time came for God to remember him. He said to Jehovah: “You will call, and I will answer you. You will long for the work of your hands.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Just think! Jehovah longs for the time when he will bring the dead back to life. Is it not heartwarming to learn that Jehovah feels that way? But what about this future resurrection? Who will be resurrected, and where?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">16. The dead will be resurrected to live in what kind of conditions?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The Bible’s resurrection accounts teach us much about the resurrection to come. People who were restored <span id="page72" class="pageNum" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>to life right here on earth were reunited with their loved ones. The future resurrection will be similar​—but much better. As we learned in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005133/">Chapter 3</a>, God’s purpose is that the whole earth be made into a paradise. So the dead will not be raised to life in a world filled with war, crime, and sickness. They will have an opportunity to live forever on this earth in peaceful and happy conditions.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">17. How extensive will the resurrection be?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Who will be resurrected? Jesus said that <em>“all </em>those in the memorial tombs will hear his [Jesus’] voice and come out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) Similarly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:13-66:20:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 20:13</a> says: “The sea gave up the dead in it, and death and the Grave gave up the dead in them.” (See the Appendix article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005157/">What Are Sheol and Hades?</a>”) This collective grave will be emptied. All those billions who rest there will live again. The apostle Paul said: “There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) What does that mean?</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>“The righteous” include many of the people we read about in the Bible who lived before Jesus came to the earth. You might think of Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Ruth, Esther, and many others. Some of these men and women of faith are discussed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:40" data-bid="22-1" class="b">the 11th chapter of Hebrews</a>. But “the righteous” also include Jehovah’s servants who die in our time. Thanks to the resurrection hope, we do not have to be afraid of dying.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:15-58:2:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">19. Who are “the unrighteous,” and what opportunity does Jehovah kindly give them?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>What about all the people who did not serve or obey Jehovah because they never knew about him? These billions of “unrighteous” ones will not be forgotten. They <span id="page73" class="pageNum" data-no="73" data-before-text="73"></span>too will be resurrected and given time to learn about the true God and to serve him. During a period of a thousand years, the dead will be resurrected and given an opportunity to join faithful humans on earth in serving Jehovah. It will be a wonderful time. This period is what the Bible refers to as Judgment Day.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Does this mean that every human who ever lived will be resurrected? No. The Bible says that some of the dead are in “Gehenna.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:5-42:12:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 12:5</a>) Gehenna got its name from a garbage dump located outside of ancient Jerusalem. Dead bodies and garbage were burned there. The dead whose bodies were thrown there were considered by the Jews to be unworthy of a burial and a resurrection. So Gehenna is a fitting symbol of everlasting destruction. Although Jesus will have a role in judging the living and the dead, Jehovah is the final Judge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) He will never resurrect those whom he judges to be wicked and unwilling to change.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 1. What is the key to a happy family life?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD wants your family life to be happy. His Word, the Bible, provides guidelines for each family member, describing the role that God wants each one to play. When family members fulfill their roles in harmony with God’s counsel, the results are very satisfying. Jesus said: “Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 2. Family happiness depends on our recognizing what?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Family happiness depends mainly on our recognizing that the family originates with Jehovah, the one Jesus called “Our Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Every family on earth exists because of our heavenly Father​—and he certainly knows what makes families happy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:14, 15</a>) So, what does the Bible teach about the role of each family member?</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 3. How does the Bible describe the start of the human family, and why do we know that what it says is true?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah created the first humans, Adam and Eve, and <span id="page135" class="pageNum" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>brought them together as husband and wife. He put them in a beautiful earthly paradise home​—the garden of Eden—​and told them to have children. “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it,” said Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:21-1:2:24" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 21-24</a>) This is not just a story or a myth, for Jesus showed that what Genesis says about the start of family life is true. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 19:4, 5</a>) Although we face many problems and life now is not as God purposed it to be, let us see why happiness within the family is possible.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 4. (a) How can each member of the family contribute to its happiness? (b) Why is studying the life of Jesus so important to family happiness?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Each member of the family can help to make family life happy by imitating God in showing love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1, 2</a>) How, though, can we imitate God, since we cannot even see him? We can learn how Jehovah acts because he sent his firstborn Son from heaven to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 18</a>) When on earth, this Son, Jesus Christ, imitated his heavenly Father so well that seeing and listening to Jesus was just like being with Jehovah and hearing Him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Therefore, by learning about the love that Jesus showed and following his example, each one of us can help to make family life happier.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">5, 6. (a) How does the way Jesus treats the congregation set an example for husbands? (b) What must be done to get forgiveness of sins?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Bible says that husbands should treat their wives in the same way that Jesus treats his disciples. Consider this Bible direction: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, <em>just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it </em>. . . In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own body, <span id="page136" class="pageNum" data-no="136" data-before-text="136"></span>but he feeds and cherishes it, <em>just as the Christ does the congregation.”​</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:29" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 25-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jesus’ love for his congregation of disciples sets a perfect example for husbands. Jesus “loved them to the end,” sacrificing his life for them, even though they were far from perfect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 13:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 15:13</a>) Similarly, husbands are urged: <em>“Keep on </em>loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Colossians 3:19</a>) What will help a husband to apply such counsel, especially if his wife at times fails to act with discretion? He should remember his own mistakes and what he must do to receive God’s forgiveness. What is that? He must forgive those who sin against him, and that includes his wife. Of course, she should do the same. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:12,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>14, 15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Do you see why some have said that a successful marriage is the union of two good forgivers?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 7. What did Jesus take into account, setting what example for husbands?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Husbands also do well to note that Jesus always showed consideration for his disciples. He took into account their limitations and physical needs. When they were tired, for example, he said: “Come, you yourselves, privately into an isolated place and rest up a little.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:30-41:6:32" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mark 6:30-32</a>) Wives too deserve thoughtful consideration. The Bible describes them as “a weaker vessel” to whom husbands are commanded to assign “honor.” Why? Because both husbands and wives share equally in “the undeserved favor of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>) Husbands should remember that it is faithfulness, not whether a person is male or female, that makes one precious to God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:101:6-19:101:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 101:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 8. (a) How is it that a husband “who loves his wife loves himself”? (b) Being “one flesh” means what for a husband and his wife?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The Bible says that a husband “who loves his wife loves himself.” This is because a man and his wife “are no <span id="page137" class="pageNum" data-no="137" data-before-text="137"></span>longer two, but <em>one flesh,” </em>as Jesus pointed out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:6-40:19:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6</a>) So they must limit their sexual interests to each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:15-20:5:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:15-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:4</a>) They can do this if they show unselfish concern for each other’s needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>) Noteworthy is the reminder: “No man ever hated his <em>own body, but he feeds and cherishes it.” </em>Husbands need to love their wives as they do themselves, remembering that they are accountable to their own head, Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:29-49:5:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul spoke of the ‘tender affection that Christ Jesus has.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:8-50:1:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Philippians 1:8</a>) Jesus’ tenderness was a refreshing quality, one that was appealing to women who became his disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:1-43:20:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 20:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:11-43:20:13" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 11-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:16-43:20:16" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 16</a>) And wives yearn for tender affection from their husbands.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>A family is an organization, and to operate smoothly, it needs a head. Even Jesus has One he submits to as his Head. “The head of the Christ is God,” just as “the head of a woman is the man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) Jesus’ submission to God’s headship is a fine example, since all of us have a head to whom we must submit.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">11. What attitude is a wife to have toward her husband, and what may be the effect of her conduct?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Imperfect men make mistakes and often fall far short of being ideal family heads. So, what should a wife do? She should not belittle what her husband does or try to take over his headship. A wife does well to remember that in God’s view, a quiet and mild spirit is of great value. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:4</a>) By displaying such a spirit, she will find it easier to demonstrate godly subjection, even under trying circumstances. Furthermore, the Bible says: “The wife <span id="page138" class="pageNum" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>should have deep respect for her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:33</a>) But what if he does not accept Christ as his Head? The Bible urges wives: “Be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with <em>deep respect.”​</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">12. Why is it not wrong for a wife to express her opinions respectfully?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Whether her husband is a fellow believer or not, a wife is not showing disrespect if she tactfully expresses an opinion that differs from his. Her viewpoint may be correct, and the whole family could benefit if he listened to her. Although Abraham did not agree when his wife, Sarah, recommended a practical solution to a certain household problem, God told him: “Listen to her.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:9-1:21:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 21:9-12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Of course, when a husband makes a final decision that does not conflict with God’s law, his wife shows her subjection by supporting it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 5:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:24-49:5:24" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In fulfilling her role, a wife can do much in caring for the family. For example, the Bible shows that married women are “to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sound in mind, chaste, working at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:4-56:2:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Titus 2:4, 5</a>) A wife and mother who acts in this way will gain the lasting love and respect of her family. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 31:10,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> <strong>28</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Since marriage is a union of imperfect individuals, however, some extreme circumstances may result in separation or divorce. The Bible allows for separation under certain circumstances. Yet, separation must not be taken lightly, for the Bible counsels: “A wife should not separate <span id="page139" class="pageNum" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>from her husband . . . , and a husband should not leave his wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:10-46:7:11" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11</a>) And only sexual immorality by one of the marriage mates provides Scriptural grounds for divorce.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 19:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jesus set a perfect example for parents in the way he treated children. When others tried to prevent the little ones from approaching Jesus, he said: “Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them.” The Bible says that he then “took the children into his arms and began blessing them, laying his hands on them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:13-41:10:16" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 10:13-16</a>) Since Jesus took time for little ones, should you not do the same for your own sons and daughters?

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The Devil tempted Jesus, and we can be sure that he will also tempt young ones to do what is wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:10" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1-10</a>) Satan the Devil uses peer pressure, which can be hard to resist. How vital it is, then, that children not keep company with wrongdoers! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) Jacob’s daughter Dinah kept company with those who did not worship Jehovah, and this led to a lot of trouble.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Family problems are easier to cope with when Bible counsel is applied. In fact, applying such counsel is the key to family happiness. So husbands, love your wife, and treat her as Jesus treats his congregation. Wives, submit to the headship of your husband, and follow the example of the capable wife described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:31" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>. Parents, train your children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>) Fathers, ‘preside over your household in a fine manner.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:4-54:3:5" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 5:8</a>) And children, obey your parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Colossians 3:20</a>) None in the family are perfect, for all make mistakes. So be humble, asking one another for forgiveness.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">21. What wonderful prospects lie ahead, and how can we enjoy happy family life now?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Truly, the Bible contains a wealth of valuable counsel and instruction regarding family life. Moreover, it teaches us about God’s new world and an earthly paradise filled with happy people who worship Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) What wonderful prospects lie ahead! Even now, we can enjoy happy family life by applying God’s instructions found in his Word, the Bible.</p>

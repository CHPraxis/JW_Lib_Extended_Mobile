<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb">“LOOK! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?” That question was asked by an Ethiopian court official in the first century. A Christian named Philip had proved to him that Jesus was the promised <span id="page175" class="pageNum" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>Messiah. Touched to the heart by what he had learned from the Scriptures, the Ethiopian man took action.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 2. Why should you think seriously about baptism?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>If you have carefully studied the earlier chapters of this book with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you may feel ready to ask, ‘What prevents <em>me </em>from getting baptized?’ By now you have learned about the Bible’s promise of everlasting life in Paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) You have also learned about the true condition of the dead and the resurrection hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 5:28, 29</a>) You have probably been associating with Jehovah’s Witnesses at their congregation meetings and have seen for yourself how they practice the true religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Most important, you have likely begun to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 3. (a) What command did Jesus give his followers? (b) How is water baptism performed?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>How can you show that you want to serve God? Jesus told his followers: “Go . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations, <em>baptizing them.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>) Jesus himself set the example by being baptized in water. He was not sprinkled with water, and he did not just have some water poured over his head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16</a>) The word “baptize” comes from a Greek term meaning “dip under water.” Christian baptism therefore means being fully dipped, or immersed, in water.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 4. What does water baptism indicate?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Water baptism is a requirement for all who want to have a relationship with Jehovah God. Baptism publicly indicates your desire to serve God. It shows that you are delighted to do Jehovah’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:7-19:40:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 40:7, 8</a>) To qualify for baptism, however, you must take definite steps.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You have already begun to take the first step. How? By <em>coming to know </em>Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, perhaps by means of a systematic study of the Bible. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But there is more to learn. Christians want to be “filled with the accurate knowledge of [God’s] will.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Colossians 1:9</a>) Attending the congregation meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a big help in this regard. It is important to attend such meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) Regular meeting attendance will help you come to know God.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Of course, you do not need to know everything in the Bible in order to qualify for baptism. The Ethiopian court official had <em>some </em>knowledge, but he needed help to understand certain parts of the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:30-44:8:31" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 8:30, 31</a>) Likewise, you still have much to learn. In fact, you will never stop learning about God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>) Before you can get baptized, however, you need to know and accept at least the basic Bible teachings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12</a>) Such teachings include the truth about the condition of the dead and the importance of God’s name and his Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 7. What effect should a study of the Bible have on you?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Knowledge alone is not enough, though, for “without faith it is impossible to please God well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) The Bible tells us that when some people in the ancient city of Corinth heard the Christian message, they “began to believe and be baptized.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:8-44:18:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 18:8</a>) In a similar way, a study of the Bible should fill you with <em>faith </em>that <span id="page177" class="pageNum" data-no="177" data-before-text="177"></span>it is the inspired Word of God. Bible study should help you to have faith in God’s promises and in the saving power of Jesus’ sacrifice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Acts 4:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You might begin to share Bible truth with others by tactfully speaking about it to your relatives, friends, neighbors, and workmates. In time, you will want to share in the organized preaching work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. At that point, feel free to talk things over with the Witness who is teaching you the Bible. If it appears that you qualify to participate in the witnessing work, arrangements will be made for you and your teacher to meet with two of the congregation elders.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>This will enable you to get better acquainted with some Christian elders, who shepherd the flock of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>) If these elders see that you understand and believe basic Bible teachings, are living in harmony with God’s principles, and truly want to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, they will let you know that you qualify to share in the field ministry as an unbaptized publisher of the good news.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">11. What changes might some have to make before they qualify for the field ministry?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>On the other hand, you may need to make some <span id="page178" class="pageNum" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>changes in your life-style and habits in order to qualify for the field ministry. This may include stopping some practices that have been kept secret from others. Hence, before you ask about becoming an unbaptized publisher, you need to be free of serious sins, such as sexual immorality, drunkenness, and drug abuse.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 6:9, 10;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>Galatians 5:19-21</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">12. Why is repentance necessary?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Some other steps must be taken before you qualify for baptism. The apostle Peter said: “Repent . . . and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) To repent is to feel sincere regret over something you have done. <em>Repentance </em>is clearly fitting if a person has lived an immoral life, but it is also necessary even if one has lived a relatively clean life morally. Why? Because all humans are sinners and need God’s forgiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>) Before studying the Bible, you did not know what God’s will was. So how could you have lived in full harmony with his will? Therefore, repentance is necessary.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">13. What is conversion?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Repentance must be followed by <em>conversion, </em>or ‘turning around.’ You must do more than feel regret. You need to reject your former way of life and be firmly determined that you will do what is right from now on. Repentance and conversion are steps that you must take before getting baptized.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:15-5:6:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>) Why, though, would someone want to do that? Well, suppose a man has begun to court a woman. The more he learns about her and sees that she has fine qualities, the more he finds himself drawn to her. In time, it is natural that he would ask her to marry him. True, getting married will mean taking on additional responsibilities. But love will move him to take that important step.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>When you come to know and love Jehovah, you are moved to serve him without holding anything back or setting any limits in worshipping him. Anyone who wants to follow God’s Son, Jesus Christ, has to “disown himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:34-41:8:34" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mark 8:34</a>) We disown ourselves by making sure that personal desires and goals do not stand in the way of our complete obedience to God.

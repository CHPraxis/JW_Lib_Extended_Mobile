<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Some have had images or shrines in their home for years. Is that true of you? If so, you might feel that it is strange or wrong to pray to God without such a visible aid. You may even feel attached to some of these items. But God is the one who says how he should be worshipped, and the Bible teaches that he does not want us to use images. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 20:4, 5;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:4-19:115:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Psalm 115:4-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Isaiah 42:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1 John 5:21</a>) So you can take a stand for <em>true </em>worship by destroying any items you own that are connected with <em>false </em>worship.

Before learning Bible truth, some believed that the dead are conscious in an invisible realm and that they can help or harm the living. Perhaps you used to go to great lengths to appease your dead ancestors. But as you learned in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005136/">Chapter 6</a> of this book, the dead have no conscious existence anywhere. Thus, attempts to communicate with them are of no use. Any messages that seem to come from a dead loved one really originate with the demons. Therefore, Jehovah forbade the Israelites to try to talk with the dead or to participate in any other form of spiritism.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 18:10-12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>CHRISTMAS​—NOT CELEBRATED BY EARLY CHRISTIANS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">6, 7. (a) Christmas supposedly commemorates what, and did Jesus’ first-century followers observe it? (b) What were birthday celebrations associated with during the time of Jesus’ early disciples?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>A person’s worship could be contaminated by false religion as it relates to popular holidays. Consider Christmas, for example. Christmas supposedly commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, and nearly every religion that claims to be Christian celebrates it. Yet, there is no evidence that the first-century disciples of Jesus observed such a holiday. The book <em>Sacred Origins of Profound Things </em>states: “For two centuries after Christ’s birth, no one knew, and few people cared, exactly when he was born.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span id="page157" class="pageNum" data-no="157" data-before-text="157"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Even if Jesus’ disciples had known the exact date of his birth, they would not have celebrated it. Why? Because, as <em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>says, the early Christians “considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.” The only birthday observances mentioned in the Bible are those of two rulers who did not worship Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:20-1:40:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 40:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:21-41:6:21" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Mark 6:21</a>) Birthday celebrations were also held in honor of pagan deities. For example, on May 24 the Romans celebrated the birthday of the goddess Diana. On the following day, they observed the birthday of their sun god, Apollo. Hence, birthday celebrations were associated with paganism, not with Christianity.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. Explain the connection between birthday celebrations and superstition.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>There is another reason why first-century Christians would not have celebrated Jesus’ birthday. His disciples likely knew that birthday celebrations were connected with superstition. For instance, many Greeks and Romans of ancient times believed that a spirit attended the birth of each human and protected that one throughout life. “This spirit had a mystic relation with the god on whose birthday the individual was born,” says the book <em>The Lore of Birthdays. </em>Jehovah certainly would not be pleased with any observance that would link Jesus with superstition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:11-23:65:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:11, 12</a>) So how did Christmas come to be celebrated by many people?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9. How did December 25 come to be regarded as the day to celebrate Jesus’ birth?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It was not until several hundred years after Jesus lived on the earth that people began to commemorate his birth on December 25. But that was <em>not </em>the date of Jesus’ <span id="page158" class="pageNum" data-no="158" data-before-text="158"></span>birth, for it evidently took place in October.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> So why was December 25 chosen? Some who later claimed to be Christian likely “wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival marking the ‘birthday of the unconquered sun.’” (<em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica</em>) In winter, when the sun seemed weakest, pagans held ceremonies to get this source of warmth and light to come back from its distant travels. December 25 was thought to be the day that the sun began its return. In an effort to convert pagans, religious leaders adopted this festival and tried to make it seem “Christian.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">10. In times past, why did some people not celebrate Christmas?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The pagan roots of Christmas have long been recognized. Because of its unscriptural origin, Christmas was banned in England and in some of the American colonies during the 17th century. Anyone who even stayed home from work on Christmas day had to pay a penalty. Soon, though, the old customs were back, and some new ones were added. Christmas once again became a big holiday, and that is what it still is in many lands. Because of the connections that Christmas has with false religion, however, <span id="page159" class="pageNum" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>those who want to please God do not celebrate it or any other holiday that has its roots in pagan worship.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">11. Why do some people celebrate holidays, but what should be our chief concern?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Some agree that such holidays as Christmas have pagan origins but still feel that it is not wrong to celebrate them. After all, most people are not thinking about false worship when they observe holidays. These occasions also give families opportunities to draw close together. Is this how you feel? If so, likely it is love of family, not love of false religion, that makes taking a stand for true worship seem difficult. Be assured that Jehovah, the one who originated the family, wants you to have a good relationship with your relatives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:14, 15</a>) But you can strengthen such bonds in ways that God approves. Regarding the matter that should be our chief concern, the apostle Paul wrote: “Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:10-49:5:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:10</a>.</p>

Do origins really matter? Yes! To illustrate: Suppose you saw a piece of candy lying in the gutter. Would you pick up that candy and eat it? Of course not! That candy is unclean. Like that candy, holidays may seem sweet, but they have been picked up from unclean places. To take a stand for true worship, we need to have a viewpoint like that of the prophet Isaiah, who told true worshippers: “Touch nothing unclean!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:11</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">13. What challenges may arise when you do not participate in holidays?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Challenges may arise when you choose not to participate in holidays. For example, fellow employees may wonder why you do not engage in certain holiday activities where you work. What if you are offered a Christmas gift? Would it be wrong to accept it? What if your marriage mate does not share your beliefs? How can you make sure that your children do not feel deprived because of not celebrating holidays?</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">14, 15. What could you do if a holiday greeting is extended to you or if someone wants to give you a gift?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Good judgment is needed to discern how to handle each situation. If a holiday greeting is casually extended, you could simply thank the well-wisher. But suppose you are dealing with someone you see or work with regularly. In that case, you might choose to say more. In all cases, be tactful. The Bible advises: “Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should answer each person.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>) Be careful not to show disrespect for others. Instead, tactfully explain your position. Make clear that you are not against gift-giving and gatherings but prefer to participate in these activities at a different time.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>What if someone wants to give you a gift? Much depends on the circumstances. The giver might say: “I know that you do not celebrate the holiday. Still, I want you to have this.” You may decide that accepting the gift under those circumstances is not the same as taking part in the holiday. Of course, if the giver is not familiar with your beliefs, you could mention that you do not observe the holiday. This would help to explain why you accept a gift but do not give one on that occasion. On the other <span id="page161" class="pageNum" data-no="161" data-before-text="161"></span>hand, it would be wise not to accept a gift if it is given with the clear intention of showing that you do not stick to your beliefs or that you would compromise for the sake of material gain.</p>

Many people truly are sighing and groaning over the wickedness that is taking place in the world today. Perhaps you know some people who feel that way. Why not speak to them about your Bible-based hope for the future? As you associate with true Christians and speak to others about the marvelous Bible truths you have learned, you will find that any desire for the customs of false worship that may have remained in your heart will gradually disappear.

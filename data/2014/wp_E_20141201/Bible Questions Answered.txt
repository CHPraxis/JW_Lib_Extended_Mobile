How can children learn to love God?






Use lessons from creation to help your child to know and to love God





Your children can learn to love God only if they have evidence that he exists and that he loves them. To love God, they need to know him. (1 John 4:8) For example, they need to know: What was God’s purpose for creating man? Why does God allow suffering? What will God do for mankind in the future?—Read Philippians 1:9.
To help your children to love God, you must show them that you love him yourself. When they see that, they will likely follow your example.—Read Deuteronomy 6:5-7; Proverbs 22:6.



How can you reach your children’s heart?

God’s Word is powerful. (Hebrews 4:12) So help your children learn its basic teachings. To reach the hearts of people, Jesus asked questions, listened, and explained the Scriptures. To reach your children’s heart, you can imitate Jesus’ ways of teaching.—Read Luke 24:15-19, 27, 32.
In addition, Bible accounts of how God dealt with people can help children to know and to love God. Publications designed for this purpose are available at www.jw.org.—Read 2 Timothy 3:16.

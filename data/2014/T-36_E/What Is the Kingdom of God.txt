What Is the Kingdom of God?

Would you say it is . . .
            something within your heart?

            a figure of speech?

            a government in heaven?





WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.”​—Daniel 2:44, New World Translation.
“A son has been given to us; and the government will rest on his shoulder.”​—Isaiah 9:6; footnote.



WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR YOU

            A righteous government that can benefit you personally.​—Isaiah 48:17, 18.

            In a coming new world, life in perfect health and happiness.​—Revelation 21:3, 4.










CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS?

Yes, for at least two reasons:
            Jesus showed what God’s Kingdom will accomplish. Jesus taught his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom to come and for God’s will to be done on earth. (Matthew 6:9, 10) Jesus demonstrated how that prayer will be answered.
While on earth, Jesus fed the hungry, healed the sick, and restored life to the dead! (Matthew 15:29-38; John 11:38-44) As the future Ruler of God’s Kingdom, Jesus provided a beautiful preview of what that Kingdom will do for its subjects.​—Revelation 11:15.

            World conditions confirm that God’s Kingdom will soon come. Jesus foretold that just before the Kingdom brings peace to the earth, our world would be plagued with wars, famines, and earthquakes.​—Matthew 24:3, 7.
We see those very conditions today. So we can be confident that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to all such problems.





TO THINK ABOUT





What will life be like under the rule of God’s Kingdom?
The Bible answers that question at PSALM 37:29 and ISAIAH 65:21-23.

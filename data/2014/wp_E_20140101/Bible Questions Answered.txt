BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What sort of person is God?

God is an invisible spirit person. He created the heavens, the earth, and all living things. No one created God—he had no beginning. (Psalm 90:2) God wants people to seek him and to know the truth about him.—Read Acts 17:24-27.
God is a person whom we can know by name. We can discern some of his qualities by contemplating the things he has made. (Romans 1:20) But to know God well, we need to study his Word, the Bible. It acquaints us with God’s loving personality.—Read Psalm 103:7-10.



How does God feel about injustice?

Our Creator, Jehovah, hates injustice. And he created humans in his image. (Deuteronomy 25:16) That is why most of us hate injustice. The injustice around us is not God’s doing. God granted man free will. Sadly, many people misuse their free will and practice injustice. Jehovah’s heart is saddened.—Read Genesis 6:5, 6; Deuteronomy 32:4, 5.
Jehovah loves justice, and he will not forever tolerate injustice. (Psalm 37:28, 29) The Bible promises that soon God will bring all injustice to an end.—Read 2 Peter 3:7-9, 13.
The Bible promises that God will soon provide justice for all

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Death is an uncomfortable subject. Many people prefer not to talk about it. But sooner or later, we must confront it. And the sting of death is sharp and painful.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Nothing can fully prepare us for the loss of a parent, a spouse, or a child. A tragedy may strike unexpectedly or unfold relentlessly. Whatever the case, the pain of death cannot be eluded, and its finality can be devastating.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Antonio, who lost his father in a road accident, explains: “It is like somebody sealing up your house and taking away the keys. You cannot return home, even for a moment. You are left with only your memories. This is the new reality. Although you try to deny it<wbr />—since it seems so unfair<wbr />—there is nothing you can do.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When faced with a similar loss, Dorothy, who became a widow at the age of 47, resolved to find some answers. As a Sunday-school teacher, she never felt that death ended it all. But she had no clear answers. “What happens to us when we die?” she asked her Anglican minister. “No one really knows,” he replied. “We will just have to wait and see.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Are we condemned merely to “wait and see”? Is there any way we can know for sure whether death ends it all?</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>MY PAST:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> I was born in Riga, the capital of Latvia. My sister and I were raised by our mother. Although Mother is a Catholic, we only went to church on the religious holidays. I have always believed in a higher power, but as a youth, I was distracted by many other interests.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As I grew up, my mother noticed that I had a flair for taking things apart and putting them back together again. With so many things in the house that could be taken apart, she was always worried about leaving me home alone. So she gave me a metal construction kit, which I loved to put together and then tear apart. That interest went hand in hand with another passion of mine<wbr />—motorbiking. My mother enrolled me in a motorbike race called <em>Zelta Mopēds </em>(The Golden Moped). I started racing with mopeds and, later, with motorcycles.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">I was a quick learner and soon became very successful in this fast and dangerous sport. Three times I won the Latvian championship for several motorcycle-racing classes, and twice I won the Baltic States Championship.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sn"> At the peak of my career, my girlfriend Evija (who later became my wife) came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses. She had found some of their literature, which contained a coupon for requesting a Bible study. She filled out the coupon and mailed it in. Soon, two Witnesses visited her, and she began to study the Bible with them. That was fine with me, but at the time, I didn’t have any great interest in spiritual things.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Later on, the Witnesses invited me to sit in on Evija’s Bible study and listen. I accepted the offer, and I liked what I heard. One thing that especially touched my heart was the Bible’s promise of a paradise earth. For example, I <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>was shown the passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>, which says: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; you will look at where they were, and they will not be there. But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” That promise really appealed to me.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">My spiritual interest continued to grow. I began to realize how many religious lies there are. In contrast, Bible teachings struck me as being refreshingly logical and clear.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">As I continued to study the Bible, I learned how highly Jehovah values life and how precious it is to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) That had an impact on my racing<wbr />—I no longer wanted to risk my life. Instead, I wanted to use my life to give glory to Jehovah. Therefore, the fame, the glory, and the thrill of motorcycle racing were no longer important to me.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc">I came to understand that I have a responsibility to the Giver of life</p>
</div>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In 1996, I attended an international convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Tallinn, Estonia, not far away from the motor stadium where I had raced often. At the convention, I saw people from many different countries meeting together in harmony and peace. For example, when one of the Witnesses lost her purse, I assumed that she would never see it again. Before long, though, a Witness found the purse and returned it with nothing missing. I was in a state of shock! I now understood that the Witnesses really live by the high standards of the Bible. Evija and I continued to progress in our studies, and in 1997 we were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>HOW I HAVE BENEFITED:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="15" class="p15 sn"> Some of my friends have died because of their wild, fast lives on motorcycles. From studying the Bible, I came to understand that I have a responsibility to the Giver of life, Jehovah. That understanding has probably saved my life.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">For four years, Evija and I had the privilege of serving as full-time ministers at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Riga. Now we find joy in raising our daughter, Alise, and helping her grow to love Jehovah. I also have the privilege of spending a day each week at the translation office, repairing cars and other things that are broken. It makes me really happy to put the skills that I learned as a child to good use! Yes, I am still tearing things apart and then putting them back together again.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">I highly value the privilege of witnessing about the only true God together with my family, all thanks to what I learned from the Bible. Indeed, the promise of a paradise earth changed my life!</p>

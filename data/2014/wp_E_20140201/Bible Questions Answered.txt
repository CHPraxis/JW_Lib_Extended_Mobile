BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Is the Bible really God’s Word?

You would expect God’s Word to be unique, and the Bible is. Billions of copies of it have been printed in hundreds of languages. The wisdom in the Bible has the power to change people for the better.—Read 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16.
We know that the Bible is from God because it accurately foretells the future. No man can do that on his own. Consider, for example, the book of Isaiah. A copy of it made over a century before Jesus’ birth was found in a cave near the Dead Sea. It says that the city of Babylon would become uninhabited. That first came true many years after Jesus’ earthly ministry.—Read Isaiah 13:19, 20; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.



How was the Bible written?

The Bible was written over a period of some 1,600 years. There were about 40 Bible writers, and they followed a single theme without contradicting one another. How was that possible? God guided their writing.—Read 2 Samuel 23:2.
Sometimes God spoke to Bible writers by means of angels, visions, or dreams. Usually, God put his idea into the mind of the writer and allowed him to select the words he would use to express God’s message.—Read Revelation 1:1; 21:3-5.

God Understands You

“O Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me.”—PSALM 139:1.








“Your eyes even saw me as an embryo.”—PSALM 139:16





WHY SOME HAVE DOUBTS: Many people feel that God sees humans only as sinners—unclean and unworthy of his attention. Kendra, who suffered from depression, felt guilt-ridden because she could not measure up perfectly to God’s requirements. As a result, she said, “I stopped praying.”
WHAT GOD’S WORD TEACHES: Jehovah looks beneath your imperfections and understands who you really are. “He well knows how we are formed,” says the Bible, “remembering that we are dust.” What is more, he does not deal with us “according to our sins,” but he mercifully forgives us when we repent.—Psalm 103:10, 14.
Consider David, the Israelite king mentioned in the first article of this series. In prayer to God, David said: “Your eyes even saw me as an embryo; all its parts were written in your book . . . Search through me, O God, and know my heart.” (Psalm 139:16, 23) Yes, David was convinced that even though he sinned—gravely at times—Jehovah could discern his repentant heart.
Jehovah understands you better than any human does. “Mere man sees what appears to the eyes,” the Bible says, “but Jehovah sees into the heart.” (1 Samuel 16:7) God knows what makes you tick—how heredity, the way you grew up, your environment, and your personality all shape the person you are. He sees and values the person you strive to be, even though you make mistakes.
How, though, does God use his profound understanding of ‘the real you’ to comfort you?

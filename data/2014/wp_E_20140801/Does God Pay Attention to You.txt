Does God Pay Attention to You?

“I am helpless and poor; may Jehovah pay attention to me.”a—DAVID OF ISRAEL, 11TH CENTURY B.C.E.








“The nations are like a drop from a bucket.”—ISAIAH 40:15





Was it reasonable for David to expect God to pay attention to him? Does God pay attention to you? Many people struggle to believe that an almighty God is interested in them. Why?
One reason is that God is a much higher life-form than mere humans. As seen from his lofty position, entire nations “are like a drop from a bucket, and as the film of dust on the scales they are regarded.” (Isaiah 40:15) One skeptical modern-day writer went so far as to conclude that it is “the height of conceit to believe that there is a divine being who takes a personal and immediate interest in your doings.”
On the other hand, some people feel that their conduct makes them unworthy of God’s attention. For example, a middle-aged man named Jim relates: “I constantly prayed for peace and self-control, but sooner or later, my anger always returned. Finally, I concluded that I was wicked to the core and that God was unable to help me.”
Is God so distant from humans that he fails to notice us? How does he really feel about his imperfect creatures? Without divine revelation, no human can rightly speak for God and answer those questions. However, God’s inspired message to humankind—the Bible—assures us that he is not a distant entity devoid of concern for individuals. “In fact,” the Bible states, “he is not far off from each one of us.” (Acts 17:27) In the following four articles, we will consider what God tells us about his interest in individuals and how he has shown such interest in real people just like you.



Psalm 40:17; Jehovah is the name of God as revealed in the Bible.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>WHY SOME HAVE DOUBTS: </strong>Even when they desperately need comfort, some people feel that it is selfish to ask God to intervene and help them cope with their problems. “When I look at the sheer number of people in the world<wbr />—and the serious problems they face,” says a woman named Raquel, “my concerns seem so insignificant that I hesitate to ask God for help.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>WHAT GOD’S WORD TEACHES: </strong>God has already intervened in a remarkable way to help and comfort humans. Everyone on earth today has inherited sin<wbr />—a chronic failure to measure up perfectly to God’s requirements. However, God “loved us and sent his Son [Jesus Christ] as a means of appeasement for our sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:10</a>; footnote) Through Jesus’ sacrificial death, God makes it possible for us to have forgiveness of sins, a clean conscience, and the hope of eternal life in a peaceful new world.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> But is that sacrifice merely for the human race as a whole, or does it reflect God’s interest in you personally?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consider the apostle Paul. He was so moved by the sacrifice of Jesus that he wrote: “I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved <em>me </em>and handed himself over for <em>me.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 2:20</a>) True, Jesus died even before Paul became a Christian. Yet, Paul viewed that sacrifice as God’s <em>personal </em>gift to him.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sacrificial death of Jesus is God’s personal gift to <em>you </em>too. That gift proves how precious you are to God. It can give you “everlasting comfort and good hope” and thus “make you firm in every good deed and word.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:16-53:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Yet, Jesus offered his life as a sacrifice almost 2,000 years ago. What evidence is there that God is reaching out to you <em>today?</em></p>

BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Do all religions honor God?

Listening to the world news, you have probably noticed that bad things are sometimes done in the name of religion. Not all religion originates with the true God. (Matthew 7:15) Indeed, much of mankind has been misled.—Read 1 John 5:19.
Nevertheless, God takes note of sincere people who love what is good and true. (John 4:23) God is inviting such people to learn the truth from his Word, the Bible.—Read 1 Timothy 2:3-5.



How can you recognize true religion?

Jehovah God is uniting people from many religious backgrounds by teaching them the truth and by teaching them to love one another. (Micah 4:2, 3) Thus, you can recognize practicers of true religion by the way they care for one another.—Read John 13:35.
Jehovah God is uniting all sorts of people by means of true worship.—Psalm 133:1

True worshippers base their faith and their way of life on the Bible. (2 Timothy 3:16) They also honor God’s name. (Psalm 83:18) And they advocate God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. (Daniel 2:44) They imitate Jesus by letting their “light shine,” doing good to their neighbors. (Matthew 5:16) True Christians can, therefore, be recognized by their neighborly visits to people’s homes for the purpose of sharing the good news of God’s Kingdom.—Read Matthew 24:14; Acts 5:42; 20:20.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">Picture a father talking with his seven-year-old son. He says, “Long, long ago, God made the earth and everything in it, and he made the sun, the moon, and the stars.” The boy thinks about this for a few moments and then asks, “Daddy, who made God?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Nobody made God,” the father replies. “He has always existed.” That simple statement satisfies the child for now. As he grows older, however, the question continues to intrigue him. He finds it hard to comprehend how anyone could be without a beginning. Why, even the universe had a beginning. ‘Where did God come from?’ he wonders.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How does the Bible answer? Essentially, in much the same way as did the father in our example. Moses wrote: “O Jehovah, <strong>. . . </strong>before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the productive land, <strong><em>from everlasting to everlasting, </em></strong>you are God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:90:1-19:90:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:1, 2</a>) Likewise, the prophet Isaiah exclaimed: “Do you not know? Have you not heard? Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, <strong><em>is a God for all eternity”! </em></strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:28-23:40:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:28</a>) Similarly, the letter of Jude refers to God as existing “for all past eternity.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/65:1:25-65:1:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jude 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those scriptures show us that God is “the King of eternity,” as the apostle Paul describes him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17</a>) This means that God has always existed, no matter how far back in time we cast our gaze. And he will always exist in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:8-66:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 1:8</a>) Thus, his eternal existence is a fundamental attribute of the Almighty.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Why do we find this idea difficult to grasp? Because our limited life span gives us a completely different concept of time from that of Jehovah. Because God is eternal, to him a thousand years are like a day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:8-61:3:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:8</a>) To illustrate: Could a grasshopper, which lives as an adult for only about 50 days, fathom our life span of 70 or 80 years? Hardly! Yet, the Bible explains that we are like grasshoppers in comparison with our Grand Creator. Even our ability to reason is dwarfed by his. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 55:8, 9</a>) So it is not surprising that there are aspects of Jehovah’s nature that escape full human understanding.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Although the concept of an eternal God may be hard to grasp, we can see that it makes sense. If someone else had created God, that person would be the Creator. Yet, as the Bible explains, Jehovah is the one who “created all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) Furthermore, we know that the universe at one time did not exist. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:1-1:1:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1, 2</a>) Where did it come from? Its Creator had to exist first. He also existed before there were any other intelligent beings, such as his only-begotten Son and the angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Colossians 1:15</a>) Clearly, then, he existed alone first. He could not have been created; nothing was in existence that could have created him.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Our own existence and that of the entire universe testifies to the existence of an eternal God. The One who put our vast universe in motion, the One who established the laws to control it, must have always existed. Only he could have breathed life into everything else.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:33:4-18:33:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:4</a>.</p>

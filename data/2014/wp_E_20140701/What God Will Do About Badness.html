<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible clearly tells us what Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ, will do about the suffering caused by Satan the Devil. “For this purpose the Son of God [Jesus] was made manifest,” declares the Bible, “to break up the works of the Devil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 3:8</a>) The present system of things based on greed, hatred, and wicked deeds will be broken up. As for “the ruler of this world”<wbr />—Satan the Devil—<wbr />Jesus promises that he “will be cast out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) Without Satan’s influence, a righteous new world will be established, and this earth will become a peaceful place.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What about those who stubbornly refuse to change their ways and who insist on doing bad things? Reflect on this straightforward promise: “Only the upright will reside in the earth, and the blameless will remain in it. As for the wicked, they will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous will be torn away from it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>) Gone will be the influence of wicked humans. Under such peaceful conditions, obedient humans will gradually be set free from inherited imperfection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:17-45:6:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 6:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 8:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In that new world, how will God eliminate badness? Not by nullifying the gift of free will and making humans robots. Rather, he will teach obedient humans his ways, helping them to turn around from harmful thoughts and actions.</p>
<div class="stdCaption floatEast"><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc">God will remove all causes of suffering</p>
</div>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What will God do about unforeseen calamities? He has promised that his Kingdom government will shortly take control of the earth. The God-appointed King of that Kingdom is Jesus Christ, who has the power to cure the sick. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:14:14-40:14:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 14:14</a>) Jesus also has the power to control the forces of nature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:4:35-41:4:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 4:35-41</a>) Hence, gone will be the suffering caused by “time and unexpected events.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>) Under Christ’s rulership, no calamity will befall mankind.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:1:33-20:1:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What about the millions of innocent people who have suffered tragic deaths? Shortly before bringing his friend Lazarus back to life, Jesus said: “I am the resurrection and the life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:11:25-43:11:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 11:25</a>) Yes, Jesus has the power to resurrect, or bring back to life, those who have died!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If the idea of living in a world where bad things will <em>not </em>happen to good people appeals to you, why not make it your aim to learn more about the true God and his purpose by studying the Bible? Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area will be happy to help you to gain that knowledge. You have our warm invitation to contact them locally or to write to the publishers of this magazine.</p>

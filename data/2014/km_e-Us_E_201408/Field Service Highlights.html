Also, efforts are being made to translate additional publications into the Dakota, Hmong, Iu Mien, and Navajo languages. May Jehovah continue to bless our efforts to reach people out of all “nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>.</p>

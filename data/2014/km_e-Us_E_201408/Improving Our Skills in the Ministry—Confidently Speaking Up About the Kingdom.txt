Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Confidently Speaking Up About the Kingdom




Why Important: If we are to follow the clear direction given at 2 Timothy 1:7, 8, it is important that we confidently speak up about the Kingdom. How can we gain confidence to advertise the Kingdom?
How to Do It:
           Have empathy for people. (Phil. 2:4) Many are distressed over world conditions or personal problems. Our having empathy motivates us to tell them about the Kingdom.

            Before leaving the house, take a few tracts with you.




Try This During the Month:
 Choose a person to whom you would like to witness. Pray to Jehovah for courage and the opportunity to speak up.

Use the New Web Site Tract




The tract is entitled Where Can We Find Answers to Life’s Big Questions? Three questions are raised on the back of the tract. When an opportunity arises, ask a person which question interests him the most and direct him to BIBLE TEACHINGS > BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED on the Web site to find the answer. There he will also find answers to the questions: What is the Kingdom of God? And what will God’s Kingdom accomplish?
Keep copies of this tract on hand to help people learn what the Bible says about our wonderful future under God’s Kingdom.

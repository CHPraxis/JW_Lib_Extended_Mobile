To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in September

“Many people believe in angels. Do you? [Allow for response.] As spirit creatures angels are very powerful, but do you think they can help us? The Bible tells us how they assist mankind today.” Show the back of the September 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return and discuss the next question.



The Watchtower September 1

We have this assurance at Psalm 65:9. [Read.] This issue of The Watchtower discusses how God will care for the earth and how we can enjoy these future blessings. May I leave it with you to read?”

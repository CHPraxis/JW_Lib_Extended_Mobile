<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On Friday, March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck Japan, claiming more than 15,000 lives and causing over $200 billion (U.S.) in damage. On being warned of the impending tsunami, 32-year-old Kei found safety on higher ground. “The next morning, I went back home to collect what I could,” he says, “but everything had been washed out to sea, including my apartment. All that was left was the foundation.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It took some time for me to grasp that I had lost not just individual items but my entire environment. It was all gone<wbr />—my car; the computers I used for my work; the tables, chairs, and sofa I had used to entertain guests; my keyboard, guitar, ukulele, and flute; my equipment for working in watercolors, oils, and pastels; all my paintings and drawings.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Try to focus on what you still have rather than on what you lost. The Bible says: “Even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 12:15</a>) Kei recalls his situation: “At first,” he says, “I made a list of what I wanted, but this just reminded me of everything that had washed away. I decided to include on my list only the things that I really needed, and I updated it as my needs were cared for. That list helped me to reestablish my life.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">Rather than become self-absorbed, use your experience to comfort others. “I received a lot of help from both public relief work and personal assistance, but as I grew accustomed to receiving, I began to lose my self-respect,” Kei says. “Then, I called to mind the Bible’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a> that ‘there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’ Since I was limited in what I could give materially, I set out to give words of encouragement to other victims of this disaster. Showing generosity in this way was a big help to me.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">Pray to God for practical wisdom to deal with your circumstances. Kei trusted the Bible’s assurance that God will “pay attention to the prayer of the destitute.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:102:17-19:102:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 102:17</a>) You can do the same.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Did you know? </strong>The Bible foretells a time when no one will need to worry about loss as a result of a natural disaster.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span><wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-23</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>THE BIBLE SAYS:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">“The swift do not always win the race, nor do the mighty win the battle, nor do the wise always have the food, nor do the intelligent always have the riches, nor do those with knowledge always have success, because time and unexpected events overtake them all.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The question, then, is not <em>whether </em>you will face adversity but how you will react when you <em>do. </em>For instance:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">  What if you lost all your possessions in a natural disaster?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">  What if you were diagnosed with a life-threatening illness?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">  What if you lost a loved one in death?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses, the publishers of this magazine, believe that the Bible can help you not only to cope when tragedy strikes but also to have a solid basis for hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) Consider three experiences that illustrate how.</p>

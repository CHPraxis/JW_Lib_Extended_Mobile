<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Irish people have endured much hardship. For example, some estimate that from about 1845 to 1851, approximately one million people died of starvation and disease when blight ruined the potato crops. To escape crippling poverty, many emigrated to countries such as Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States. Today, some 35 million Americans trace their ancestry to Ireland.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Irish are known for being warmhearted and hospitable. Favorite pastimes include horseback riding and team sports, such as cricket, rugby, soccer (which they call football), and Gaelic football (which is similar to soccer). Women in particular enjoy a team sport called camogie, which is similar to field hockey.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>The people of Ireland also take delight in conversation, and they love music. Irish step dance is famous worldwide. Dancers keep their upper body rigid while performing quick and precise movements with their feet.</p>

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Worship Jehovah, the King of Eternity
This article will confirm that Jehovah has always been King and will reveal how he has expressed his kingship to his heavenly and earthly creatures. It will also encourage us to follow past examples of those who chose to worship Jehovah, the King of eternity.

▪  100 Years of Kingdom Rule​—How Does It Affect You?
This article will deepen our appreciation for what the Messianic Kingdom has accomplished during its first 100 years. It will also encourage each of us to be a loyal subject of the Kingdom, and it will stimulate meditation on the full meaning of our yeartext for 2014.

▪  Making Wise Choices During Youth
▪  Serving Jehovah Before the Days of Distress Come
What will I do with my life? This is a vital question for anyone who has dedicated himself to Jehovah. In these articles, we will discuss principles that can guide young Christians to serve God fully, as well as opportunities that older Christians have to expand their ministry.

▪  “Let Your Kingdom Come”​—But When?
Today, many people are distracted by world conditions or by a pursuit of their own interests. This article reviews three lines of evidence that help Christians to be confident that God’s Kingdom will soon bring this wicked system to its end.

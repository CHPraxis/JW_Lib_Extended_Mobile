<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Few things can hurt us more deeply than the pain we suffer when a relative or a close friend is expelled from the congregation for unrepentant sin. How we respond to the Bible’s direction on this matter can reveal the depth of our love for God and of our loyalty to his arrangement.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Consider some questions that arise on this subject.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>How should we treat a disfellowshipped person? </em>The Bible says: “Stop keeping company with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>) Regarding everyone who “does not remain in the teaching of the Christ,” we read: “Do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 John 9-11</a>) We do not have spiritual or social fellowship with disfellowshipped ones. <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1981688/30:160-35:946"><em>The Watchtower </em>of September 15, 1981, page 25</a>, stated: “A simple ‘Hello’ to someone can be the first step that develops into a conversation and maybe even a friendship. Would we want to take that first step with a disfellowshiped person?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Is strict avoidance really necessary? </em>Yes, for several reasons. First, it is a matter of loyalty to God and his Word. We obey Jehovah not only when it is convenient but also when doing so presents real challenges. Love for God moves us to obey all his commandments, recognizing that he is just and loving and that his laws promote the greatest good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) Second, withdrawing from an unrepentant wrongdoer protects us and the rest of the congregation from spiritual and moral contamination and upholds the congregation’s good name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:6-46:5:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:6, 7</a>) Third, our <span id="page208" class="pageNum" data-no="208" data-before-text="208"></span>firm stand for Bible principles may even benefit the disfellowshipped one. By supporting the decision of the judicial committee, we may touch the heart of a wrongdoer who thus far has failed to respond to the efforts of the elders to assist him. Losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help him to come “to his senses,” see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:17-42:15:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 15:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>What if a relative is disfellowshipped? </em>In such a case, the close bond between family members can pose a real test of loyalty. How should we treat a disfellowshipped relative? We cannot here cover every situation that may arise, but let us focus on two basic ones.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In some instances, the disfellowshipped family member may still be living in the same home as part of the immediate household. Since his being disfellowshipped does not sever the family ties, normal day-to-day family activities and dealings may continue. Yet, by his course, the individual has chosen to break the spiritual bond between him and his believing family. So loyal family members can no longer have spiritual fellowship with him. For example, if the disfellowshipped one is present, he would not participate when the family gets together for family worship. However, if the disfellowshipped one is a minor child, the parents are still responsible to instruct and discipline him. Hence, loving parents may arrange to conduct a Bible study with the child.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:20-20:6:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:17-20:29:17" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 29:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In other cases, the disfellowshipped relative may be living outside the immediate family circle and home. Although there might be a need for limited contact on some rare occasion to care for a necessary family matter, any such contact should be kept to a minimum. Loyal Christian family members do not look for excuses to have dealings with a <span id="page209" class="pageNum" data-no="209" data-before-text="209"></span>disfellowshipped relative not living at home. Rather, loyalty to Jehovah and his organization moves them to uphold the Scriptural arrangement of disfellowshipping. Their loyal course has the best interests of the wrongdoer at heart and may help him to benefit from the discipline received.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">DURING his final night on earth as a human, Jesus expressed deep concern for the future welfare of his followers. He even prayed about the matter, saying to his Father: “I do not request that you take them out of the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one. They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:15-43:17:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:15, 16</a>) In this heartfelt request, Jesus showed both his deep love for his followers and the importance of his words stated earlier that night to some of them: “You are no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>) Clearly, it was of great importance to Jesus that his followers keep separate from the world!</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 2. What is “the world” to which Jesus referred?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>“The world” Jesus mentioned refers to all of mankind who are alienated from God, ruled by Satan, and enslaved to the selfish, prideful spirit that emanates from him.

We will consider five ways: by remaining loyal to God’s Kingdom under Christ and neutral in worldly politics, by resisting the spirit of the world, by being modest in our <span id="page51" class="pageNum" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>dress and grooming, by keeping our life simple, and by putting on our spiritual suit of armor.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Because ambassadors represent a foreign sovereign or state, they do not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries where they serve; they remain neutral. Ambassadors do, however, advocate the government of the country they represent. The same is true of Christ’s anointed followers, whose “citizenship exists in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:20-50:3:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 3:20</a>) In fact, thanks to their zealous Kingdom preaching, they have helped millions of Christ’s “other sheep” to “become reconciled to God.” <span id="page52" class="pageNum" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:40" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matthew 25:31-40</a>) These latter ones serve as Christ’s envoys, as it were, in support of Jesus’ anointed brothers.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">  Secular history provides ample evidence that the early Christians remained politically neutral and refrained from warfare. Says the book <em>The Beginnings of Christianity: </em>“The founders of Christianity guarded with sedulous care against the development of anything like a disposition to interfere directly with the established political order.” Similarly, the book <em>On the Road to Civilization </em>notes: “Early Christianity was little understood and was regarded with little favor by those who ruled the pagan world. . . . Christians refused to share certain duties of Roman citizens. . . . They would not hold political office.”</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">  Regarding the early Christians and military service, German theologian Peter Meinhold said: “Being a Christian and a soldier was considered irreconcilable.” In his essay “An Inquiry Into the Accordancy of War With the Principles of Christianity,” religion writer Jonathan Dymond wrote that for some time after the death of Jesus, His followers “refused to engage in [war]; whatever were the consequences, whether reproach, or imprisonment, or death.” Dymond added: “These facts are indisputable.” Only when “Christianity became corrupted,” said another writer, did Christians become soldiers.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Another way that Christians keep separate from the world is by resisting its evil spirit. “We received, not the <span id="page54" class="pageNum" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from God,” wrote Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>) To the Ephesians, he said: “You at one time walked according to . . . this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The world’s “air,” or spirit, is an invisible, impelling force that incites disobedience to God and fosters “the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:9, 10</a>) “The authority” of this spirit lies in its appeal to the sinful flesh, its subtlety, its relentlessness and, like air, its pervasiveness. Moreover, it is “at work” in disobedient humans by gradually nurturing in them ungodly traits, such as selfishness, haughtiness, greedy ambition, and the spirit of moral independence and rebellion.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Simply put, the spirit of the world progressively causes the traits of the Devil to grow in the hearts of humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:10-44:13:10" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Acts 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:10" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>An outward indication of the spirit that impels a person is his dress, grooming, and hygiene. In many lands, standards of dress have fallen so low that one television commentator suggested that soon there will be nothing left for prostitutes to wear. Even girls not yet in their teens have been caught up in this trend​—“long on skin, short on modesty,” said one newspaper report. Another trend is to dress in a slovenly manner that reflects a spirit of rebellion as well as a lack of dignity and self-respect.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12, 13. What principles should govern our dress and grooming?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>As servants of Jehovah, we rightly want to look our best, which means dressing in a way that is neat, clean, in good taste, and appropriate for the occasion. At all times, our appearance ought to reflect “modesty and soundness of mind,” which along with “good works” is fitting for anyone​—male or female—​“professing devotion to God.” Of course, our main concern is, not to draw attention to ourselves, but to “keep [ourselves] in God’s love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:21-65:1:21" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jude 21</a>) Yes, we want our most beautiful adornment to be “the secret person of the heart . . . , which is of great value in the eyes of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Keep in mind, too, that our clothing styles and grooming can influence how others view true worship. The Greek word rendered “modesty,” when used in a moral sense, expresses the thought of reverence, awe, and respect for the feelings or opinion of others. Our goal, therefore, should be to subordinate our presumed rights to the consciences of others. Above all, we want to bring honor to Jehovah and his people <span id="page57" class="pageNum" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>and to recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, doing “all things for God’s glory.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:9-46:4:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 4:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 10:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 7:1</a>.</p>

Jehovah has no desire to deny us our freedom of choice or the use of our thinking faculties.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">18. How does the Bible describe our enemy, his methods, and the nature of our “struggle”?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Those who keep themselves in God’s love also enjoy spiritual protection from Satan, who wants to deprive Christians, not just of happiness, but of everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) “We have a struggle,” said Paul, “not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:12</a>) The word “struggle” suggests that our <span id="page60" class="pageNum" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span>fight is not long-distance​—from the safety of a hidden bunker, so to speak—​but hand-to-hand. Furthermore, the terms “governments,” “authorities,” and “world rulers” indicate that attacks from the spirit realm are highly organized and deliberate.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Despite human frailties and limitations, however, we can gain the victory. How? By taking up “the complete suit of armor from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:13-49:6:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:13</a>) Describing that armor, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:14-49:6:18" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:14-18</a> reads: “Stand firm, therefore, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist, wearing the breastplate of righteousness, and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace. Besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows. Also, accept the helmet [or, hope] of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word, while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit.”</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Since it is a provision of God, that spiritual suit of armor will not fail us, provided that we wear it at all times. Unlike literal soldiers, who may have long breaks from fighting, Christians are in a relentless life-and-death struggle that will not stop until God has destroyed Satan’s world and abyssed all wicked spirits.

Hence, Paul reminds us of the need to pray to Jehovah “on every occasion in spirit.” At the same time, we should listen to Jehovah by studying his Word and associating with fellow “soldiers” at every opportunity, for we are not in this fight alone!

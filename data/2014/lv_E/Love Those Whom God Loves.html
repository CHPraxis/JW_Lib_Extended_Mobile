<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IN A way, people are like sponges; they tend to absorb whatever surrounds them. It is all too easy to adopt​—even unwittingly—​the attitudes, standards, and personality traits of those with whom we have close association.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Bible expresses an inescapable truth when it says: “The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) This proverb speaks about more than casual contact. The expression “walking with” suggests ongoing association.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Commenting on this verse, one Bible reference work says: “To walk with a person implies love and attachment.” Would you not agree that we tend to imitate those we love? Indeed, because we attach ourselves emotionally to those we love, they can have a molding effect on us​—for good or for bad.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>To remain in God’s love, it is vital that we seek out associates who will influence us for the good. How can we do that? Put simply, we can do so by loving those whom God loves, making his friends our friends. Think <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>about it. What better associates could we choose than those who have the qualities that Jehovah looks for in his friends? Let us, then, examine the kind of people who are loved by God. With Jehovah’s viewpoint clearly in mind, we will be better equipped to choose wholesome associates.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. Why does Jehovah have the right to be particular about his friends, and why did Jehovah refer to Abraham as “my friend”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When it comes to friendship, Jehovah is particular. Does he not have the right to be? After all, he is the Sovereign Lord of the universe, and friendship with him is the greatest of all privileges. Whom, then, does he choose as his friends? Jehovah draws close to those who trust in him and put their full faith in him. Consider, for example, the patriarch Abraham, a man known for his outstanding faith. It is hard to imagine a greater test of faith for a human father than to be asked to offer up his son as a sacrifice.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Yet, Abraham “as good as offered up Isaac,” having full faith that “God was able to raise him up even from the dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:17-58:11:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:17-19</a>) Because Abraham displayed such faith and obedience, Jehovah affectionately referred to him as “my friend.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:21-59:2:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> James 2:21-23</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah places a high value on loyal obedience.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah loves those who love Jesus, his only-begotten Son. Jesus said: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:23-43:14:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:23</a>) How can we show our love for Jesus? Surely by observing his commandments, including the commission to preach the good news and make disciples.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>) Jehovah’s heart is touched by the efforts of those whose love for his Son moves them to pursue a Christlike course.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Faith, loyalty, obedience, and love for Jesus and his ways​—these are among the qualities that Jehovah looks for in His friends. Each of us does well to ask himself: ‘Are such qualities and ways evident in my close associates? Have I made Jehovah’s friends my friends?’ It is wise to do so.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The Scriptures contain many examples of those who benefited as a result of choosing wholesome associates. You can read about the relationship between Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth, between the three young Hebrews who stuck together in Babylon, and between Paul and Timothy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:16-8:1:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ruth 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:17-27:3:18" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Daniel 3:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:17-46:4:17" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:20-50:2:22" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Philippians 2:20-22</a>) Let us, though, focus on another outstanding example: the friendship between David and Jonathan.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">9, 10. What was the basis of the friendship between David and Jonathan?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The Bible says that after David slew Goliath, “Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship, and Jonathan began to love him as himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:1-9:18:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:1</a>) Thus began an unbreakable friendship that despite a significant age difference, persisted until Jonathan’s death on the battlefield.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:26-10:1:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Samuel 1:26</a>) What was the basis of the strong bond forged between these two friends?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>David and Jonathan were bound together by their love for God and their strong desire to remain faithful to him. These two men shared a spiritual bond. Each displayed qualities that endeared him to the other. Jonathan no doubt was impressed with the courage and zeal of the young man who fearlessly defended Jehovah’s name. David undoubtedly respected the older man who <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>loyally supported Jehovah’s arrangements and unselfishly put David’s interests ahead of his own. Consider, for example, what happened when David was at a low point in his life, living as a fugitive in the wilderness to escape the wrath of wicked King Saul, Jonathan’s father. In a remarkable demonstration of loyalty, Jonathan took the initiative and “went out to David . . . , and he helped <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>him find strength in Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:16-9:23:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Samuel 23:16</a>) Imagine how David must have felt when his dear friend came and offered him support and encouragement!<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11. What do you learn about friendship from the example of Jonathan and David?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What do we learn from the example of Jonathan and David? Above all, we see that the most important thing for friends to have in common is spiritual values. When we draw close to those who share our beliefs, our <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>moral values, and our desire to remain faithful to God, there can be an interchange of thoughts, feelings, and experiences that encourage and upbuild us. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 1:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We find such spiritually-minded associates among fellow worshippers.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Even within the congregation, we must be selective if our associates are to be spiritually upbuilding. Should this surprise us? Not really. Some Christians in the congregation may take longer to reach spiritual maturity, even as some fruit on a tree may take longer to ripen. Thus, in any given congregation, we find Christians who are at different levels of spiritual growth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:6:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12–6:3</a>) Of course, we show patience and love to newer or weaker ones, for we want to help them to grow spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:1-45:14:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 14:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:1-45:15:1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 15:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Occasionally, there may be a situation in the congregation that calls for us to watch our association. Some individuals might engage in questionable conduct. Others may develop a bitter or complaining spirit. Congregations in the first century C.E. faced a similar challenge. While most members were faithful, some individuals did not conduct themselves aright. Because some in the congregation in Corinth did not uphold certain Christian teachings, the apostle Paul warned the congregation: “Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:12-46:15:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Paul cautioned Timothy that even among fellow Christians, there might be <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>some who do not act honorably. Timothy was told to keep clear of such ones, not making them his close associates.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:20-55:2:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 2:20-22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>How can we apply the principle behind Paul’s warnings? By avoiding close association with anyone​—inside or outside the congregation—​who could be a corrupting influence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:6-53:3:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:14-53:3:14" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 14</a>) We must protect our spirituality.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 133:1</a>) How can you find spiritually-minded friends in the congregation? As you cultivate godly qualities and ways, no doubt others of like mind will be drawn to you. At the same time, you may need to take some practical steps to reach out and make new friends. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008062/61-63">How We Made Good Friends</a>.”) Look for those who display the qualities you want to reflect. Heed the Bible’s counsel to “open your hearts wide,” seeking out friendships with fellow believers regardless of race, nationality, or culture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:13-47:6:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 2:17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Do not limit yourself to those of your own age group.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>As our Creator and Life-Sustainer, Jehovah deserves our love and complete devotion.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>At times, we are called upon to withdraw our fellowship from one who has been a member of the congregation. This situation arises when an individual who unrepentantly violates God’s law is disfellowshipped or <span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span>when one rejects the faith by teaching false doctrine or by disassociating himself from the congregation. God’s Word plainly tells us to “stop keeping company” with such ones.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 5:11-13;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:11" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 2 John 9-11</a>) It may be a real challenge to avoid someone who had perhaps been a friend or who is related to us. Will we take a firm stand, thereby showing that we put loyalty to Jehovah and his righteous laws above all else? Remember that Jehovah places a high value on loyalty and obedience.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20, 21. (a) Why is the disfellowshipping arrangement a loving one? (b) Why is it vital that we choose our associates wisely?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>The disfellowshipping arrangement is really a loving provision from Jehovah. How so? Expelling an unrepentant sinner shows love for Jehovah’s holy name and all that it stands for. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>) Disfellowshipping keeps the congregation safe. Faithful members are protected from the unwholesome influence of willful sinners and can go about their worship knowing that the congregation is a safe haven from this wicked world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:15-58:12:16" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Hebrews 12:15, 16</a>) The strong discipline shows love for the wrongdoer. It may be just the jolt he needs to come to his senses and take the steps necessary to return to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>We cannot escape the fact that our close associates can have a powerful, molding effect on us. It is vital, then, that we choose our associates wisely. By making Jehovah’s friends our friends, by loving those whom God loves, we will surround ourselves with the best possible associates. What we absorb from them will help us to live up to our determination to please Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">OUR heavenly Father has given us a priceless possession​—the gift of life as intelligent humans who are capable of reflecting his qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) Thanks to that precious gift, we are able to reason on Bible principles. By applying them, we can grow into spiritually mature people who love Jehovah and whose “powers of discernment [have been] trained to distinguish both right and wrong.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The ability to reason on Bible principles is especially important today, for the world has become so complex that no amount of laws could cover every possible situation that might arise in life. Medical science well illustrates this point, especially in regard to products and procedures involving blood. This is an area of interest and concern to all who want to obey Jehovah. Still, if we understand the relevant Bible principles, we should be able to make wise decisions that both satisfy our conscience and keep us in God’s love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:6-20:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:6-11</a>) Consider some of these principles.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah first disclosed the intimate connection between <span id="page75" class="pageNum" data-no="75" data-before-text="75"></span>life and blood, as well as their sanctity, or sacredness, shortly after Cain murdered Abel. “Listen!” God said to Cain. “Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:10-1:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 4:10</a>) In Jehovah’s eyes, Abel’s blood represented his life, which had been brutally cut short. So, in a sense, Abel’s blood cried out to God for vengeance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:24-58:12:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>After the Noachian Flood, God gave humans permission to eat the flesh of animals but not the blood. God stated: “Only flesh with its life​—its blood—​you must not eat. Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4, 5</a>) This command applies to all of Noah’s descendants right down to our day. It reaffirms what was implied in God’s earlier words to Cain​—that the life, or soul, of all creatures is represented by the blood. That decree also establishes that Jehovah, the Source of life, will hold to account all humans who disrespect life and blood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">5, 6. How did the Mosaic Law show that blood is both sacred and precious? (See also the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008066/76-78">Respect the Life of Animals</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>These two fundamental truths were reflected in the Mosaic Law. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:10, 11</a> reads: “If any man . . . eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc">  In God’s Word, blood is considered to be equivalent to life. Hence, instead of being condemned because he broke Jehovah’s commandments, a repentant sinner in ancient Israel could offer an animal sacrifice on God’s altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:27-3:4:31" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Leviticus 4:27-31</a>) This sacrifice atoned for his sins but only in a provisional way.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">  As used in the Bible, “atonement” conveys the thought of “exchange” or “cover,” as the right lid, for example, would properly cover a container. Of course, no animal could perfectly “cover,” or atone for, the sins of a human. Animal sacrifices did, however, provide a shadow of the perfect atonement sacrifice to come.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:4-58:10:4" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sc">  That atonement was provided “through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:10-58:10:10" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:10</a>) Christ’s perfect human life, represented by his “precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb,” corresponded exactly to the life that Adam lost. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:19-60:1:19" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:19</a>) Thus, in an exquisitely beautiful and loving way, justice was satisfied and our “everlasting deliverance” was made possible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:11-58:9:12" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Revelation 7:14</a>.</p>

Provided that the creature was properly slaughtered and bled, <span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>an Israelite could eat it with a clear conscience, as due respect would have been accorded to the Life-Giver.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 7. How did David show respect for the sanctity of blood?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>David, “a man agreeable to [God’s] heart,” grasped the principles behind God’s law on blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:22-44:13:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 13:22</a>) On one occasion when he was very thirsty, three of his men forced their way into the enemy camp, drew water from a cistern, and brought it to him. How did David react? “Should I drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives?” he asked. In David’s eyes, the water was, in effect, the lifeblood of his men. So despite his thirst, he “poured it out to Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:15-10:23:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">8, 9. Did God’s view of life and blood change with the establishment of the Christian congregation? Explain.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Some 2,400 years after the Noachian decree and about 1,500 years after the Law covenant was made, Jehovah inspired the governing body of the early Christian congregation to write: “The holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Clearly, the early governing body discerned that blood is sacred and that misusing it is as morally wrong as participating in idolatry or committing sexual immorality. True Christians today accept that stand. Moreover, because they think in terms of Bible principles, they are able to please Jehovah when making decisions about the use of blood.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses recognize that “abstaining from . . . blood” means not accepting blood transfusions and <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>not donating or storing their own blood for transfusion. Out of respect for God’s law, they also do not accept the four primary components of blood: red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Today, through further processing, these components are often broken down into fractions that are used in a variety of ways. Could a Christian accept such fractions? Does he view them as “blood”? Each one must personally decide on this matter. The same applies to such medical procedures as hemodialysis, hemodilution, and cell salvage involving one’s own blood, provided that it has not been stored.​—See the Appendix article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008086/">Blood Fractions and Surgical Procedures</a>.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>) Although the command to “abstain from . . . blood” was not given as a health regulation, it does shield us from complications related to blood transfusions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:20-44:15:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 15:20</a>) In fact, many in the medical field rate bloodless surgery as the “gold standard” of modern medical care.

For example, he required that Israelite houses have a parapet around the roof to prevent accidents, since roofs were places of considerable activity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:8-5:22:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:9:25-9:9:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 9:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:16-16:8:16" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> <span id="page80" class="pageNum" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span>Nehemiah 8:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:9-44:10:9" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Acts 10:9</a>) God also commanded that dangerous bulls be kept under guard.

In some lands, accidents are the leading cause of death among the young, often because they take needless risks. However, young ones who want to remain in God’s love value life and do not seek excitement in dangerous activities. They do not foolishly think that youth spells invulnerability.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>In God’s eyes, Satan’s entire world is bloodguilty. Its political systems, portrayed in the Scriptures as vicious beasts, have slaughtered countless millions, including <span id="page83" class="pageNum" data-no="83" data-before-text="83"></span>many of Jehovah’s servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:3-27:8:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Daniel 8:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:20-27:8:22" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Revelation 13:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:7-66:13:8" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) Hand in hand with these beastlike powers, business and science have worked to create some of the most heinous weapons imaginable, making huge profits in the process. How true that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Because Jesus’ followers are “no part of the world” but remain strictly neutral toward its politics and wars, they avoid personal and community bloodguilt.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 17:16</a>) And in imitation of Christ, they do not respond violently when others persecute them. Rather, they show love for their enemies, even praying for them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:44-40:5:44" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matthew 5:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:21" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Romans 12:17-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Above all, true Christians avoid involvement with “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion and the most bloodguilty of all. “In her,” says God’s <span id="page84" class="pageNum" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>Word, “was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.” Thus, we are warned: “Get out of her, my people.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:6-66:17:6" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Revelation 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 18:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23. What does it mean to get out of Babylon the Great?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Abandoning Babylon the Great involves more than having one’s name removed from a membership roll. It also includes hating the evil practices that false religion condones or openly advocates​—such things as immorality, political meddling, and the greedy pursuit of wealth. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 97:10;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:7-66:18:7" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Revelation 18:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:9-66:18:9" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:11-66:18:17" data-bid="36-4" class="b"> 11-17</a>) How often these activities lead to bloodshed!</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">24, 25. (a) On what basis can God show mercy to a repentant person who is bloodguilty? (b) This reminds us of what arrangement in Bible times?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Before taking up true worship, each of us, in one way or another, lent support to Satan’s system and thus incurred a measure of bloodguilt. However, because we changed our ways, cultivated faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice, and dedicated our life to God, we gained God’s mercy and spiritual protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) That protection reminds us of the cities of refuge in Bible times.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:11-4:35:15" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Numbers 35:11-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:1-5:21:9" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 21:1-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>How did that arrangement work? If an Israelite accidentally caused another’s death, he was to flee to one of the cities of refuge. After qualified judges ruled on the matter, the accidental manslayer had to reside in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Then he would be free to live elsewhere. What a beautiful example of God’s mercy and of the great value he places on human life! Similar to those ancient cities of refuge is God’s provision, based on Christ’s ransom sacrifice, for protecting us from death for accidentally violating God’s commandment about the sanctity of life and blood. Do you <span id="page85" class="pageNum" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>value that provision? How can you show that you do? One way is by inviting others to accept God’s provision of protection, especially in view of the fast-approaching “great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:1-47:6:2" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 6:1, 2</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26-28. In what way is our situation today similar to that of the prophet Ezekiel, and how can we keep ourselves in God’s love?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>The situation of God’s people in our day calls to mind that of the ancient prophet Ezekiel, whom Jehovah commissioned to serve as a spiritual watchman to the house of Israel. “When you hear a word from my mouth you must warn them from me,” said God. If Ezekiel were to neglect his commission, he would be held personally responsible for the blood of those executed when Jerusalem was called to account. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:7-26:33:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>) But Ezekiel was obedient and incurred no bloodguilt.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Today, we face the end of Satan’s entire world. Thus, Jehovah’s Witnesses count it both an obligation and a privilege to proclaim God’s “day of vengeance” in conjunction with the Kingdom message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:2-23:61:2" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14</a>) Do you have a full share in this vital work? The apostle Paul took his preaching commission seriously. As a result, he could say: “I am clean from the blood of all men, for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:26-44:20:27" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 20:26, 27</a>) What a fine example for us to imitate!</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Of course, to keep ourselves in the warmth of Jehovah’s fatherly love, we must do more than view life and blood as Jehovah does. We also need to remain clean, or holy, in his eyes, as we shall see in the following chapter.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="sc">  Although Jehovah allows us to kill animals for food and clothing or to protect ourselves from harm, we must exercise that authority in a balanced, kind way.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:9-1:10:9" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Genesis 10:9</a>) Rather, we should imitate Jehovah, who is interested in the welfare of all animals, even tiny sparrows.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:11-32:4:11" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Jonah 4:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:29" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Matthew 10:29</a>.</p>

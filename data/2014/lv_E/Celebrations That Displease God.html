<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Bible makes no mention of a birthday celebration for Jesus. In fact, his exact birth date is unknown. We can be sure, though, that he was not born on December 25 in the cold of winter in that part of the <span id="page146" class="pageNum" data-no="146" data-before-text="146"></span>world.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> For one thing, Luke recorded that when Jesus was born, “shepherds [were] living out of doors” minding their flocks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:8-42:2:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 2:8-11</a>) If “living out of doors” had been their habit year round, that would not have been noteworthy. However, because Bethlehem is subject to cold rains and snow, flocks were wintered under cover and shepherds would not have been “living out of doors.” Additionally, Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem because Caesar Augustus had ordered a census. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-7</a>) It is highly unlikely that Caesar would have commanded a people who were resentful of Roman rule to travel to their ancestral cities in the dead of winter.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">6, 7. (a) The roots of many Christmas customs can be found where? (b) What contrast can be seen between Christmas giving and Christian giving?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The roots of Christmas are found, not in Scripture, but in ancient pagan festivals, such as the Roman Saturnalia, a celebration dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture. Likewise, according to their reckoning, devotees of the god Mithra celebrated December 25 as the “birthday of the invincible sun,” says the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia. </em>“Christmas originated at a time when the cult of the sun was particularly strong at Rome,” about three centuries after the death of Christ.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Even though the birth of a baby has always been a cause for much joy, the Bible makes no reference to a birthday celebration for a servant of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>) Was this simply an oversight? No, for two birthday celebrations are mentioned​—that of a Pharaoh of Egypt and that of Herod Antipas. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:20-1:40:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 40:20-22;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:21-41:6:29" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> <strong>Mark 6:21-29</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Both events, however, are presented in a bad light​—especially the latter, which saw John the Baptizer beheaded.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">10, 11. How did the early Christians view birthday celebrations, and why?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“The early Christians,” notes <em>The World Book Encyclopedia, </em><span id="page151" class="pageNum" data-no="151" data-before-text="151"></span>“considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.” The ancient Greeks, for instance, believed that each person had a protective spirit that attended the person’s birth and thereafter watched over him. That spirit “had a mystic relation with the god on whose birthday the individual was born,” says the book <em>The Lore of Birthdays. </em>Birthdays also have a long-standing and an intimate link with astrology and the horoscope.</p>
<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div id="p83" data-pid="83" class="boxTtl rule"><div><strong>“HOLY” DAYS AND SATANISM</strong></div></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sc">  It is of interest to note that the most important day in the religion called Satanism is one’s birthday. Why? Because Satanists hold that each individual is a god if he chooses to view himself as one. Thus, to celebrate one’s own birthday is to celebrate the birth of a god. Of course, most people do not take such an extreme, egotistical view. Nevertheless, the book <em>The Lore of Birthdays </em>states: “Other holidays lift the heart, but birthdays warm the ego.”</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sc">  The next most “holy” days on the Satanists’ calendar are Walpurgis Night and Halloween. <em>Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary </em>defines the former as “the eve of May Day on which witches are held to ride to an appointed rendezvous.”</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Customs vary from country to country.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:11-23:65:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:11</a>) One such tradition involves the throwing of rice or its substitutes. This practice may have had its roots in the notion that food appeased evil spirits and kept them from doing injury to the bride and groom. Additionally, rice has a long mystical association with fertility, happiness, and longevity. Clearly, all who want to remain in God’s love will shun such tainted customs.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:18" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 6:14-18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>A common practice at weddings and on other social occasions is toasting. The 1995 <em>International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture </em>says: “Toasting . . . is probably a secular vestige of ancient sacrificial libations in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods . . . in exchange for a wish, a prayer summarized in the words ‘long life!’ or ‘to your health!’”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>True, many people may not consciously view toasting as a religious or superstitious gesture.

Would it be appropriate for those who love Jehovah to attend or view such an event? Would their doing so reflect a genuine hatred for what is bad?

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>On the days of worldly celebrations, a Christian would be careful that his conduct not give others the impression that he is joining in the celebration. “Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else,” wrote Paul, “do all things for God’s glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>; see the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008072/98-107">Making Wise Decisions</a>.”) On the other hand, if a custom or a celebration clearly retains no false religious significance, is not part of a political or patriotic observance, and violates no Bible principles, then each Christian might make a personal decision as to whether he will share in it. At the same time, he would consider the feelings of others so as not to become a cause for stumbling.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sc">  At times, situations may arise that test our love for Jehovah and our grasp of Bible principles. For example, a Christian may be invited by an unbelieving marriage mate to have a meal with relatives on a worldly holiday. Some Christians may in good conscience accept; others may not. If a Christian does accept such an offer, his conduct should make it plain that he is not celebrating the holiday and that his visit is purely to enjoy a meal with relatives.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sc">It would be prudent for a Christian to speak respectfully to his marriage mate in advance, explaining the embarrassment that might occur if the relatives share in holiday activities and the Witness declines. The unbelieving mate might decide to visit on another day.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="63-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sc">  After hearing his wife’s explanation, what if the husband of a Christian woman still insists that she accompany him? She might conclude that as head of the household, he has the responsibility to provide food for the family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:18-51:3:18" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Colossians 3:18</a>) In this case, the meal is at the home of his relatives. She may even be able to give a fine witness on that occasion. The food is not contaminated just because it is eaten on a worldly holiday. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:8-46:8:8" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>) The Christian might view it as a common meal and not join in any holiday greetings, songs, toasts, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="sc">  Another factor to be considered is the effect that sharing in such a meal might have on others. A Christian wife should take into account the possibility that others who learn of her visit with worldly relatives on that day might be stumbled.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:9-46:8:9" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:23-46:10:24" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 10:23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="sc">  In addition, will the family pressure the Christian wife to compromise? The desire to avoid any embarrassment can exert a powerful influence! So it would be important to <span id="page159" class="pageNum" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>think the matter through in advance, taking all these factors into consideration, including, of course, her own Christian conscience.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:16-44:24:16" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Acts 24:16</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p104" data-pid="104"><strong>Should I Accept a Christmas Bonus?</strong></h3>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="sc">  During the Christmas season, a Christian’s employer may offer a present or a bonus. Should the Christian reject such? Not necessarily. The employer may not even be thinking that by accepting the bonus the receiver is celebrating Christmas. The employer may simply be giving all his workers a share of the company’s profits. Or the bonus may be evidence of his gratitude for services rendered all year long as well as a stimulus to continued good work. The employer may give a gift to all employees​—Jews, Muslims, or others—​regardless of whether they celebrate Christmas or not. So the mere timing of the gift or the name that may be associated with it does not necessarily rule out its acceptance by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="sc">  Even if the gift is given because of a religious holiday, that does not mean that the recipient is thought to share the religious view. A fellow worker or a relative may tell a Witness, “I know that you do not celebrate this holiday, but I still want you to have this as a gift from me.” If the Christian’s conscience would be at rest, he might choose to accept the gift and express thanks without any reference to the holiday. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:1-44:23:1" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Acts 23:1</a>) Perhaps at a time when there will be less likelihood of causing offense, the Christian can tactfully explain his stand.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="sc">  However, what if the one offering the gift has the clear intention of showing that the Christian is not firm in his beliefs or will compromise for material gain? Then it is definitely best to decline. To be sure, we want to render Jehovah God exclusive devotion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Matthew 4:8-10</a>.</p>

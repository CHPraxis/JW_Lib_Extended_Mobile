<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">Dear Lover of Jehovah:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,” said Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>) How encouraging those words are! Yes, it is possible to know the truth, even in these critical “last days” when falsehood abounds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Do you remember when you first recognized the truth as explained in God’s Word? What a thrilling experience that was!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, as important as it is to have an accurate knowledge of the truth and to have a regular share in telling others about it, we must also conduct ourselves in harmony with the truth. To do that, we need to keep ourselves in God’s love. What does this involve? Jesus’ words on the night before his death answer this question. He told his faithful apostles: “If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:10-43:15:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Notice that Jesus remained in God’s love by observing his Father’s commandments. The same is true of us today. To remain in God’s love, we need to apply the truth in everyday life. That same evening, Jesus said: “If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:17-43:13:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is our sincere hope that this publication will help you to continue to apply the truth in your life and thus keep yourself “in God’s love . . . with everlasting life in view.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:21-65:1:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jude 21</a>.</p>

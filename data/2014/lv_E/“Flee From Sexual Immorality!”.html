<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb">THE fisherman goes down to his favorite spot. He has a particular kind of fish in mind. He selects a lure and casts his line into the water. Moments later, the line goes taut, the rod bends, and he reels in his catch. Smiling, he knows he has chosen the right lure.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the year 1473 B.C.E., a man named Balaam gave much thought to a lure. His intended prey, though, were God’s people, who were camped on the Plains of Moab, at the border of the Promised Land. Balaam professed to be a prophet of Jehovah, but he was really just a greedy man hired to curse Israel. However, through Jehovah’s intervention, Balaam was only able to bless Israel. Set on earning his reward, Balaam reasoned that perhaps he could induce God to curse his own people, if only they could be tempted to commit gross sin. With that goal in mind, Balaam cast the lure​—the seductive young women of Moab.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:1-4:22:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 22:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:15-4:31:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 31:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:14-66:2:14" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 2:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Did this strategy work? To an extent, yes. Tens of thousands of Israelite men took the lure by committing “sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab.” They even began to worship Moabite gods, including <span id="page98" class="pageNum" data-no="98" data-before-text="98"></span>the disgusting Baal of Peor, a god of fertility, or sex. As a result, 24,000 Israelites perished right at the border of the Promised Land. What a monumental tragedy that was!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:1-4:25:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 25:1-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>What paved the way for this calamity? Many of the people had developed a wicked heart by drawing away from Jehovah, the very God who had delivered them from Egypt, fed them in the wilderness, and led them safely to the land of promise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:12-58:3:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:12</a>) Reflecting on the matter, the apostle Paul wrote: “Neither let us practice sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, only to fall, 23,000 of them in one day.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:8-46:10:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) And in imitation of Zimri, who boldly paraded a Midianite woman right into the Israelite camp to his own tent, some who associate with God’s people today have become a corrupting influence within the Christian congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:6-4:25:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 25:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:14-4:25:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:4" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jude 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As used in the Bible, “sexual immorality” (Greek, <em>por·neiʹa</em>) applies to illicit sexual relations outside of Scriptural marriage. It includes adultery, prostitution, and sex relations between unmarried individuals, as well as oral and anal sex and the sexual manipulation of the genitals of an individual to whom one is not married. It also includes such acts between individuals of the same sex as well as bestiality.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:33</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Consider the example of Dinah, a daughter of the patriarch Jacob. Despite her good upbringing, Dinah unwisely made friends with Canaanite girls. Like the Moabites, the Canaanites were notoriously immoral. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:6-3:18:25" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:6-25</a>) In the eyes of Canaanite men, including Shechem​—“the most honorable” of his father’s household—​Dinah seemed to be legitimate prey.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:18-1:34:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Genesis 34:18, 19</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:30:20-1:30:24" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Genesis 30:20-24</a>) As a child, Joseph saw firsthand the fruits of his sister’s folly. No doubt these memories, as well as Joseph’s desire to remain in God’s love, protected him years later in Egypt when his master’s wife tried to seduce him “day after day.” Of course, as a slave Joseph could not simply hand in his resignation and leave! He had to deal with the situation wisely and courageously. <span id="page106" class="pageNum" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>This he did by repeatedly saying no to Potiphar’s wife and, in the end, by fleeing from her.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:12" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 39:7-12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Consider: If Joseph had fantasized about the woman or had habitually daydreamed about sex, would he have been able to keep his integrity? Most likely not. Instead of entertaining sinful thoughts, Joseph prized his relationship with Jehovah, which was evident in his words to Potiphar’s wife. “My master,” he would say, “has not withheld from me anything at all except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:8-1:39:9" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Genesis 39:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">20. How did Jehovah maneuver matters in the case of Joseph?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Imagine the joy that Jehovah must have felt as he observed young Joseph, far from his family, maintaining his integrity day after day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) Later, Jehovah maneuvered matters so that Joseph was not only released from prison but also made Egypt’s prime minister and food administrator! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:39-1:41:49" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Genesis 41:39-49</a>) How true the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>: “O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:25-58:11:25" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:25</a>) Moreover, they pale into insignificance when compared with the lasting happiness that results from obedience to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Being imperfect, we all struggle to subdue fleshly desires and do what is right in God’s eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Romans 7:21-25</a>) Jehovah is aware of this, “remembering that we are dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a>) Sometimes, though, a Christian may commit a serious sin. Is his situation hopeless? By no means! Granted, the wrongdoer may reap bitter fruitage, as did King David. Nevertheless, God is always “ready to forgive” those who are contrite and “openly confess” their sins.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:16-59:5:16" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> James 5:16</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:13-20:28:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 28:13</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">24, 25. (a) How did the young man described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:6-20:7:23" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Proverbs 7:6-23</a> show that he was “lacking good sense”? (b) How can we ‘acquire good sense’?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>The Bible speaks of a person “lacking good sense” and of one who “acquires understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:7-20:7:7" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 7:7</a>) Because of spiritual immaturity and inexperience in God’s service, someone “lacking good sense” may lack discernment and good judgment. Like the young man described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:6-20:7:23" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Proverbs 7:6-23</a>, he may more readily fall victim to serious sin. However, “whoever acquires good sense” gives serious attention to the inner person by means of regular, prayerful study of God’s Word. And to the extent possible in his imperfect state, he harmonizes his thoughts, desires, emotions, and goals in life with what God approves. Thus he “loves himself,” or blesses himself, and “will find success.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:8-20:19:8" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Ask yourself: ‘Am I fully convinced that God’s standards are right? Do I firmly believe that adherence to them results in the greatest happiness?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:10" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>) If you have even a tiny doubt, address the situation. Meditate on the consequences of ignoring God’s laws. In addition, “taste and see that Jehovah is good” by living the truth and by filling your mind with wholesome thoughts​—things that are true, righteous, chaste, lovable, and virtuous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:9" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:8, 9</a>) You can be sure that the more you do so, the more you grow to love God, to love what he loves, and to hate what he hates. Joseph was no superman. Yet, he was able to “flee from sexual immorality” because he allowed Jehovah to mold him over many years, to give him good sense. May the same be true of you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A spiritually unhealthy habit, masturbation instills attitudes that foster self-centeredness and corrupt the mind.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> A masturbator may also grow to view others as mere sex objects​—tools for sexual satisfaction. Sex becomes separated from love and is relegated to a reflex that gives momentary pleasure and relieves sexual tension. But that relief is only temporary. In reality, instead of deadening the body’s members “as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, [and] uncontrolled sexual passion,” masturbation arouses them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The apostle Paul wrote: “Beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) If you are struggling to heed these words, do not give in to despair. Jehovah is always “ready to forgive” and to help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:9-42:11:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 11:9-13</a>) Indeed, your self-condemning heart and your efforts to give up the habit​—despite occasional relapses—​indicate a good attitude. Keep in mind, too, that “God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:20-62:3:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 3:20</a>) God sees more than our sins; he sees the whole person. This knowledge enables him to hear with sympathy our earnest pleas for mercy. So never weary of turning to God in humble <span id="page219" class="pageNum" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>and earnest prayer, like a child who goes to his father when in trouble. Jehovah will bless you with a cleansed conscience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:1-19:51:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 51:1-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:17-19:51:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Isaiah 1:18</a>) Of course, you need to take positive steps in harmony with your prayers. For example, you would strive to avoid all forms of pornography as well as bad associates.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If your problem with masturbation persists, please speak about the matter with a Christian parent or a spiritually mature and caring friend.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:8-20:1:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:3-56:2:5" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Titus 2:3-5</a>.</p>

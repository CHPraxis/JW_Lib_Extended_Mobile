The special public talk for the 2014 Memorial season is entitled “Why Would a Loving God Permit Wickedness?”

When engaging in public witnessing using a table or a cart, publishers should not display Bibles. However, they may have Bibles available to offer to individuals who request one or who demonstrate sincere interest in the truth.

The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning on Friday, May 9, 2014. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on this day. Also, there will be no arrangement for tours on the day of the Memorial, Monday, April 14, 2014.

Since March has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

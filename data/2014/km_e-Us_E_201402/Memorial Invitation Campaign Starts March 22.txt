Memorial Invitation Campaign Starts March 22




This year our campaign to invite others to attend the Memorial begins on Saturday, March 22. All are encouraged to have a full share. On the weekends we will also offer the current magazines when appropriate. On the first Saturday in April, we will focus on distributing invitations rather than on starting Bible studies. However, if we encounter someone who shows special interest, we may still try to start a Bible study. The service overseer can determine whether distributing invitations through public witnessing will help the congregation to reach more people in its territory. Make a list now of relatives, workmates, schoolmates, return visits, and other acquaintances whom you wish to invite, and give them an invitation when the campaign begins. We hope that many will join us as we commemorate the two greatest expressions of love.—John 3:16; 15:13.

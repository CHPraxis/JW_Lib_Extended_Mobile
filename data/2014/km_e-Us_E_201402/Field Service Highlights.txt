Field Service Highlights




We are thrilled to report two new peaks during the month of August 2013! In the United States there was a new peak of 1,219,931 publishers. This is an increase of 16,289 over the previous peak in August 2012. Additionally, the Bahamas reported a peak of 205 regular pioneers. These figures show that many are willingly making sacrifices for Jehovah.—Ps. 54:6.

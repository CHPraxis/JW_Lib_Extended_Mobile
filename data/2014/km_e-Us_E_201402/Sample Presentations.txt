To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in March

“We’re visiting briefly because of something that will occur on April 14. That date is the anniversary of Jesus’ death. Some will commemorate the occasion because they feel that his death was important. Others are not sure of the significance of Jesus’ death. Do you think that Jesus’ death benefits you and me?” Allow for response. Show the back of the March 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to discuss the next question.



The Watchtower March 1

“Many people wonder why God doesn’t act to end the injustice and suffering in the world. Do you think it’s because God doesn’t care or because he feels that it’s good for humans to suffer? [Allow for response. Then read John 3:16.] Although many quote this verse to show that God cares, they are not sure how the death of God’s son actually benefits them. This magazine explains how Jesus’ death makes possible the end of injustice and suffering on earth.”



Awake! March

“We’re visiting briefly to try to clear up a misconception that many have about this Bible verse. [Read Genesis 1:1.] Some believe this, that the universe was created, while others do not. May I ask what your opinion is? [Allow for response.] Many have trouble believing in creation because religious leaders teach something that the Bible really doesn’t say. This magazine presents the Bible’s logical and credible explanation of the beginning of the universe.”

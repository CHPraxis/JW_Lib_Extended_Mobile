BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Can angels help us?






As they helped God’s faithful servant Daniel in the past, today angels help people to benefit from the good news




Jehovah God created millions of angels long before he created humans. (Job 38:4, 7) These angels are powerful spirit creatures in God’s service, sometimes being sent by him to guide and protect his servants on earth. (Psalm 91:10, 11) Today, angels are helping people to benefit from the good news that Jesus’ followers are preaching.​—Read Revelation 14:6, 7.
Should we pray to the angels for help? No. Prayer is an act of worship, which belongs only to God. (Revelation 19:10) Since angels are God’s servants, they respond to instructions from him rather than from people. Therefore, we should always direct our prayers only to God through Jesus.​—Read Psalm 103:20, 21; Matthew 26:53.



Are there bad angels?

Like humans, angels were created with free will and can choose to do right or wrong. Sadly, many angels rebelled against God. (2 Peter 2:4) First among these was Satan; others followed and became demons. In recent times, Satan and his demons were expelled from heaven and thrown down to the earth.​—Read Revelation 12:7-9.
The dramatic increase in wickedness and violence since 1914 signals that God will soon put Satan and the demons out of action. Then God will restore the earth to its rightful state.​—Read Revelation 12:12; 21:3, 4.

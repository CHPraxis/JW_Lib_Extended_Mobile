<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>“I understood that I had neglected my children when they most needed my guidance and affection,” admits Eduardo. “I had not been there to read them Bible stories, to pray with them, to cuddle them, and to play with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 6:7</a>) <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>His oldest daughter, Anna, recalls: “I felt emotionally insecure not having our father at home with us. When he returned, we knew him only by his face and voice. It didn’t feel natural when he hugged me.”</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How does a husband’s absence affect his ability to fulfill his role as family head?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>A father’s absence also erodes his ability to fulfill his role as family head. Eduardo’s wife, Ruby, explains: “I had to play two roles​—Mom and Dad—​and I got used to making most of the family decisions. When Eduardo came home, I had to learn what Christian subjection really means. Even now, I sometimes have to remind myself that my husband is here.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22, 23</a>) Eduardo adds: “The girls were used to going to their mother for permission to do things. As parents, we realized that we needed to present a united front to our children, and I had to learn to take the lead in a Christian way.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did one father begin to repair the damage his absence had caused, and with what result?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Eduardo was determined to do all he could to mend his relationship with his family and to build up their spiritual strength. “My goal was to inculcate the truth in my children by word and example​—not just to <em>say </em>I love Jehovah but to <em>show </em>it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:18-62:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 3:18</a>) Did Jehovah bless Eduardo’s acts of faith? “Seeing all his efforts to be a good father and to draw close to us again made a big difference,” answers Anna. “When we saw him reaching out in the congregation, we felt proud. The world was trying to pull us away from Jehovah. But we saw our parents focused on the truth, so we tried to do the same. Papa promised never to leave us again, and he didn’t. If he had, I probably wouldn’t be in Jehovah’s organization today.”</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Some experiences show that during the war in the Balkans, the children of Jehovah’s Witnesses who lived there were happy despite the harsh living conditions. Why? Parents, who could not leave to go to work, stayed home and studied with, played with, and talked with their children. The lesson? More than money or gifts, children need their parents to be with them. Indeed, as God’s Word states, children will benefit if they receive parental attention and training.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Sadly, some returning parents, upon encountering resentment or indifference in their children, respond, “How can you be so ungrateful for all the sacrifices I have made for you?” However, their children’s negative attitude may be largely due to the parents’ having been absent. What can a parent do to heal the breach?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Ask Jehovah to help you show your family members extra understanding. Then, when speaking with your family, acknowledge and accept your share of responsibility for the problem. A genuine apology may help. As your mate and children observe that you are consistently trying to make things right, they will sense your sincerity. With determination and patience, you may gradually regain your family’s love and respect.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why should ‘providing for our own’ not require that we constantly strive for more material things?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul directed that when <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>older Christians cannot make ends meet, their children and grandchildren should “repay their parents and grandparents what is due them.” But Paul went on to urge all Christians to be content with their daily necessities​—food, clothing, and shelter. We should not constantly be striving for a higher standard of living or for future financial security. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:4-54:5:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 5:4,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> <strong>8;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> <strong>6:6-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>To ‘provide for one’s own,’ a Christian does not need to seek material riches in this world, which will soon pass away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) We must not let “the deceptive power of riches” or “anxieties of life” put at risk our family’s “firm hold on the real life” in God’s righteous new world!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:19-41:4:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mark 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 21:34-36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 6:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How can we show godly wisdom in regard to amassing debt?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah knows that we need <em>some </em>money. But money cannot protect and sustain us the way godly wisdom can. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 12:15</a>) In many cases, individuals underestimate the cost of going overseas to work, and there are no guarantees that they will make money abroad. In fact, there are grave dangers. Many emigrants return with even greater debt. Rather than being freer to serve God, they end up serving those to whom they owe money. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:7-20:22:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 22:7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The wise course is to avoid going into debt in the first place.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How can holding to a budget help families to reduce financial pressure?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Eduardo knew that to make a success of his decision to remain with his family, he had to be practical about money. He and his wife established a budget based on what material things they really needed. Naturally, the budget was much more restrictive than his family was used to. But all of them cooperated and did not spend money on nonessentials.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> “For example,” Eduardo says, “I took my children out of private schools and found good public schools for them.” He and his family prayed that he would find secular work that would not interfere with their spiritual routine. How did Jehovah answer their prayers?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>What practical steps did one father take to support his family, and how did Jehovah bless his determination to keep life simple?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“For the first two years, we barely got by,” Eduardo recalls. “My funds were dwindling, my meager income did not always cover expenses, and I was physically tired. But we could attend all the meetings and go in service together.” Eduardo made up his mind not even to consider job offers that would keep him away from his family for months or years at a time. “Instead,” he says, “I learned to do various jobs so that when one type of work was not available, I could do another.”</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Because Eduardo had to pay off his debts gradually, he had to pay more interest on the money that he had borrowed. But he considered this a small price to pay in order for him to share with his family in all aspects of their lives, as Jehovah desires parents to do. “I now make less than 10 percent of what I made overseas,” Eduardo says, “but we don’t go hungry. ‘The hand of Jehovah is not short.’ In fact, we decided to pioneer. Remarkably, after that the economic pressure lessened and obtaining our material necessities became much easier.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 59:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Returning emigrants as well as those who decline opportunities to leave their family to go abroad often face the anger, scorn, and disappointment of relatives who may have looked to them as breadwinners. Some call them unloving. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:6-20:19:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 19:6, 7</a>) “Nevertheless,” notes Eduardo’s daughter Anna, “when we refuse to sacrifice spiritual things for material advantage, some of our relatives may eventually realize how important our Christian life really is.

My husband even had to step down from serving as an elder.

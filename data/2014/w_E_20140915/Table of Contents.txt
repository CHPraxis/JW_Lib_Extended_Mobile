STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Are You Convinced That You Have the Truth? Why?
This article will highlight some reasons why many people conclude that Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth. We will also consider reasons why Witnesses are convinced that they have the truth.

▪  Serve God Loyally Despite “Many Tribulations”
Tribulation is a by-product of living in Satan’s world. Some trials are like frontal attacks on our faith; others are more subtle. This article will help us to recognize these and prepare for Satan’s attack.

▪  Parents—Shepherd Your Children
Parents are to raise their children “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.” (Eph. 6:4) This article discusses three ways that they can do so and act as spiritual shepherds to their growing children.

▪  The Last Enemy, Death, Brought to Nothing
How did death become a part of the human experience? How will ‘the last enemy, death, be brought to nothing’? (1 Cor. 15:26) See how the answers highlight Jehovah’s justice, his wisdom, and especially his love.

▪  Remember Those in the Full-Time Service
Jehovah has long had faithful servants who have served him full-time despite the challenges of doing so in this system of things. What can we do to ‘remember their faithful work and loving labor’?—1 Thess. 1:3.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Our Web site is a valuable tool to help us spread the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) Most householders do not find jw.org on their own. Rather, they learn about it only after a publisher directs them to it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A traveling overseer has downloaded the video <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&amp;docid=502013341"><em>Why Study the Bible?</em></a> to his phone and shows it every chance he gets. For example, when going from house to house, he says: “I’m making brief visits to help people find answers to three important questions: Why does the world have so many problems? How will God fix them? And how can we cope in the meantime? This short video addresses those questions.” He then presses the play button and watches the householder’s reaction. The video is so captivating that most people do not take their eyes off the screen until the end. Then the traveling overseer says: “You just heard that you can request a Bible study online. Since I’m here, I could give you a quick demonstration now.” If the householder agrees, he demonstrates the study using the <em>Good News </em>brochure. If the householder does not have time, he makes arrangements to do so on the next visit. When he goes to a coffee shop to take a break, he says something similar to someone sitting nearby after striking up a friendly conversation. Are you using jw.org in your ministry?</p>

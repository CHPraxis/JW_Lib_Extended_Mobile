Young people in the world today often make material things more important than relationships. They may want a good job, a nice home, or the latest electronic gadgets. If their life revolves around these things, they are missing the most important thing, which is their relationship with God. If you have been raised by Christian parents, you have received a wonderful spiritual gift. <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) A lack of appreciation for your spiritual inheritance could have a bad effect on you for the rest of your life.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Some people mentioned in the Bible received a wonderful spiritual inheritance but did not appreciate it.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>It was similar with the sons of King Josiah. Josiah was a faithful king who loved and worshipped Jehovah. When the book of God’s Law was found and read to Josiah, he applied Jehovah’s instructions. He removed idolatry and spiritism from the land, and he urged the people to obey Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:22:8-12:22:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Kings 22:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:2-12:23:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:12-12:23:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 12-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:24-12:23:25" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) His sons received a wonderful spiritual inheritance!

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When Josiah’s son Jehoahaz became king, he did “what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.” He was king for only three months when an Egyptian Pharaoh put him in prison.

He too did not appreciate what he had received from his father. He was so bad that Jeremiah said about him: “With the burial of a donkey he will be buried.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:22:17-24:22:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 22:17-19</a>) Josiah’s son Zedekiah and grandson Jehoiachin were just as bad and did not follow the faithful example of Josiah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:8-12:24:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:18-12:24:19" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.</p>

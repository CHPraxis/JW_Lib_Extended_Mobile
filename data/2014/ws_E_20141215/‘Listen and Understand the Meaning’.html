<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">WHEN someone is speaking to us, we may hear the sound of his voice and even notice the tone of his voice. But to understand what he is saying, we need to understand the meaning of his words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:9-46:14:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:9</a>) Jesus spoke to thousands in their own language. But not all of them understood the meaning of his words. So Jesus said: “Listen to me, all of you, and understand the meaning.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:7:14-41:7:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 7:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Why did many of these people not understand what Jesus meant? Some already had their own opinions or even had wrong motives.

They did not want to change their customs and their opinions. These people heard with their ears but did not understand with their heart. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:13-40:13:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 13:13-15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>How can we make sure that we are always willing to learn from Jesus’ teaching?</p>

First, we need to take the time to study and meditate on Jesus’ words, do research, and ask the right questions. That is <strong>knowledge. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:4-20:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:4, 5</a>) Second, we need to see how this knowledge connects with what we already know and how it can benefit us personally. That is <strong>understanding. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:2-20:2:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:2, 3</a>) Third, we should use what we have learned and apply it in our lives.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What is the meaning of Jesus’ illustration of the mustard grain?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:31-40:13:32" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 13:31, 32</strong></a><strong>. What </strong><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>is the meaning of Jesus’ illustration of the mustard grain? </strong>The mustard grain represents both the Kingdom message that we preach and the Christian congregation. When the Christian congregation started in 33 C.E., it was very small, like “the tiniest of all the seeds.” In a short time, it grew rapidly because of the preaching work. Many did not expect that it would grow as much and as fast as it did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 1:23</a>) Jesus tells us that “the birds of heaven” were able to “find lodging among its branches.” This means that as the Christian congregation grew bigger, those with good hearts found spiritual food, shade, and shelter there.<wbr />—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:17:23-26:17:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>Why did Jesus use this illustration? </strong>He used the amazing growth of a mustard grain to illustrate how God’s Kingdom grows, how it protects, and how it overcomes all obstacles. Since 1914, the growth of the Christian congregation has been extraordinary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:22</a>) Those who are part of this congregation are helped to stay close to Jehovah.

Yet, we must never forget that the Kingdom can overcome any obstacle. This will give us the strength to endure. For example, when Brother Edwin Skinner arrived in India in 1926, there were not many Witnesses and the work was “hard going” because the growth was very slow. But he kept on preaching and saw the Kingdom message overcome great obstacles. Today there are more than 37,000 Witnesses in India, and more than 108,000 attended the Memorial in 2013. In the same year that Brother Skinner arrived in India, the work had just started in Zambia. Now there are more than 170,000 Witnesses there, and 763,915 attended the Memorial in 2013. This means that 1 in every 18 persons in Zambia attended the Memorial. What amazing growth!</p>

What is the meaning of the illustration of the leaven? </strong>This illustration refers to the Kingdom message and how it changes people’s lives. “The whole mass” of flour represents all the nations. The fermenting process pictures the way the Kingdom message is spreading as a result of the preaching work. While the growth of the mustard grain is visible right away, the spreading of the leaven is not. Only some time later do we see the results.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why did Jesus use the illustration about the leaven?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Why did Jesus use this illustration? </strong>Jesus showed that the Kingdom message has the power to reach “the most distant part of the earth” and to cause many changes in the hearts of people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) At first we may not notice these changes, but they are happening.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The effect of the preaching work is often seen years after people first hear the message. For example, back <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>in 1982, Franz and Margit, a couple who were serving at Bethel in Brazil, witnessed in a small town. They started several Bible studies, one with a mother and her four children. The oldest boy was just 12 years old at the time. He was very shy and often tried to hide before the study began. Because of a change of assignment, Franz and Margit could not continue the study. Twenty-five years later, they went back for a visit. Imagine their joy when they found a congregation of 69 publishers, 13 of whom were regular pioneers, all meeting in a new Kingdom Hall! And that shy boy had grown up and now serves as the coordinator of the body of elders! Like the leaven in Jesus’ illustration, the Kingdom message had spread and changed many lives.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Even in countries where the brothers cannot preach freely, the power of the Kingdom message is still able to change people. We are often surprised when we learn how far the message has spread in such countries. For example, the Kingdom message reached Cuba in 1910, and Brother Russell visited this island in 1913. At first, there was not much growth. But what is happening in Cuba today? There are over 96,000 publishers preaching the good news, and 229,726 attended the Memorial in 2013. That is 1 out of every 48 inhabitants. Even in countries that are not under ban, the Kingdom message may have reached into areas where local Witnesses do not think that witnessing can be done.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:8:7-21:8:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:11:5-21:11:5" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 11:5</a>.</p>

What is the meaning of the illustrations about the traveling merchant and the hidden treasure? </strong>In Jesus’ time, some merchants would travel very far to search for the finest pearls and buy them. The “one pearl of high value” in Jesus’ illustration represents the precious truth of the Kingdom, and the merchant represents those people with good hearts who search everywhere to find this truth. The merchant was willing to sell everything he had “promptly” so that he could buy this valuable pearl. Jesus also gave an illustration of a man who was working in a field and found “hidden” treasure. Unlike the merchant, this man was not searching for treasure. But once he saw its value, he too was willing to sell “everything” so that he could have it.</p>

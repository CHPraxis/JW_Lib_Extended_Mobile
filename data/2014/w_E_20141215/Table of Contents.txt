STUDY ARTICLES
▪  ‘Listen and Understand the Meaning’
▪  Do You “Grasp the Meaning”?
How can we make sure that we understand the meaning of Jesus’ illustrations? These two articles will show us how to analyze seven illustrations that Jesus used. They will also help us to see how we can apply in our Christian ministry the lessons learned from these illustrations.

▪  Facing the End of This Old World Together
▪  Do You Appreciate What You Have Received?
In a world where many youths are centered on self, why should Christian youths seek unity with God’s people? These articles will consider good examples and bad ones, addressing issues that will help young and old alike to make wise choices.

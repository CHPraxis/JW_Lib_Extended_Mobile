<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">MANY people have heard this thought expressed: ‘You don’t appreciate what you have until it’s gone.’ Have you sometimes felt that way? When one has had things from childhood, there is a tendency not to appreciate them fully. For example, a person who grows up in a wealthy household may take for granted many of the things he has. This can be the case with youths who because of a lack of experience may not yet fully discern what things in life are truly valuable.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>2, 3. </strong>(a) Christian youths should be careful to avoid what? (b) What can help us to appreciate what we have?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>If you are young, maybe in your teens or early 20’s, what is important to you? For many in the world, life revolves around material things<wbr />—a good salary, a nice home, or the latest high-tech devices. However, if these are our only concerns, something important is missing<wbr />—spiritual riches. Sadly, millions today have not even begun to look for these. You young ones who have been raised by Christian parents must be careful not to lose sight of the value of what you <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>have received in the form of a spiritual inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) A lack of appreciation could result in sad consequences that might affect you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>You, though, can prevent that from happening. What will help you to treasure your spiritual inheritance? Let us consider some Bible examples that can help us see why it is wise to value our spiritual inheritance. The examples we will consider can assist not only young people but every Christian to cherish what he or she has spiritually.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We can find Bible accounts of some who received a rich spiritual heritage but failed to appreciate it. That was true in the family of one prophet, Samuel, who served Jehovah from a young age and had a fine record with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:12:1-9:12:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 12:1-5</a>) Samuel set an example that his sons, Joel and Abijah, would have done well to imitate. However, they did not appreciate this, and they turned out to be bad. The Bible record tells us that unlike their father, they “perverted justice.”<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:8:1-9:8:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 8:1-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>It was similar with King Josiah’s sons. Josiah set a superb example in worshipping Jehovah. When the book of God’s Law was found and read to Josiah, he made an earnest effort to apply Jehovah’s instructions. He worked to eliminate idolatry and spiritism from the land, and he encouraged the people to obey Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:22:8-12:22:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:2-12:23:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:12-12:23:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 12-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:24-12:23:25" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) What a rich spiritual inheritance his sons received! Three of his sons and one grandson in time became kings, but not one of them showed appreciation for what had been passed on to him.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Josiah’s son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king, but he did “what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.” He ruled for only three months before an Egyptian Pharaoh imprisoned him, and Jehoahaz died in captivity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:31-12:23:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:31-34</a>) Then his brother Jehoiakim ruled for 11 years. He too lacked appreciation for what he had received from his father. Because of Jehoiakim’s bad course, Jeremiah prophesied about him: “With the burial of a donkey he will be buried.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:22:17-24:22:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 22:17-19</a>) Josiah’s other successors<wbr />—his son Zedekiah and his grandson Jehoiachin—<wbr />were no better; neither chose to follow Josiah’s upright ways.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:8-12:24:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:18-12:24:19" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Solomon was a king who received much from his father, David. Though Solomon came from an outstanding spiritual background and started out well, he later lost appreciation for the right way. “In Solomon’s old age, his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods, and his heart was not complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:11:4-11:11:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:4</a>) Consequently, Solomon lost Jehovah’s favor.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>How sad to see that these men who had such a promising background and the opportunity to do what was right let it go to waste! Yet, not all young ones turned out that way in Bible times, nor do they today. Let us consider some positive examples of youths whom young Christians can imitate.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We find an excellent example in Noah’s sons. Their father received the command to build an ark and to get his household into it. Noah’s sons evidently appreciated the need to do Jehovah’s will. They must have cooperated with their father. In time, they helped him build the ark, and then they went into it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:7:1-1:7:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:7:7-1:7:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 7</a>) With what goal in mind? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:7:3-1:7:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 7:3</a> says that they took animals into the ark “to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth.” Humans too were saved.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Centuries later, four young Hebrew men showed that they had learned what was really important. Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah, and Daniel were taken to Babylon in 617 B.C.E. They were good-looking, intelligent young men who could easily have just blended into the Babylonian way of life. But they did not. It is apparent from their actions that they remembered their heritage, what they had been taught. The four were richly blessed for adhering to the spiritual lessons they had learned when they were young.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:8-27:1:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 1:8,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:11-27:1:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> <strong>11-15,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:20-27:1:20" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> <strong>20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

A key question now is, Will you show appreciation for what you have received? That may call on you to do some self-examination. Consider such questions as: ‘How do I feel about being part of the long line of faithful witnesses? How do I feel about being among the relatively few on earth today who are known by God?

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Some youths brought up by Christian parents may not see the stark contrast between our current spiritual paradise and Satan’s dark world. Some have even been tempted to see what life in the world is like. But would you run in front of a moving car just to find out how painful<wbr />—and possibly fatal—<wbr />that could be? Of course not! Similarly, there is no need for us to experience the “decadent course of debauchery” in this world just to discover how excruciatingly distressing that can be.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Gener, who lives in Asia, was raised in a Christian family. He got baptized at age 12. As a teenager, though, he became attracted to the ways of this world. He says: “I wanted to experience the ‘freedom’ the world offers.” Gener began to live a double life. By age 15, he had taken up some of the lifestyle of his bad companions. He was drinking and cursing like them. Gener often came home late, after playing billiards and violent computer games with his friends. However, as time passed, he began to realize that the attractions of this world were not truly satisfying. It was an empty way of life. He says about his coming back to the congregation: “There are many challenges that still confront me, but the blessings from Jehovah far outnumber them.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>Even young ones not raised by Christian parents should reflect on what?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Of course, there are other young ones associated with the congregation who were not raised by Christian parents. If you are one of them, think what a wonderful privilege you are now enjoying because you know and serve the Creator! There are billions of people on the earth. Thus, it is a real blessing to be among those whom Jehovah has kindly drawn to himself and to whom he has revealed Bible truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:44-43:6:45" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 6:44, 45</a>) Only about 1 in every 1,000 people alive today has an accurate knowledge of the truth, and you are one of them.

In that way, you can join a long line of faithful servants of God. That is so much wiser than merely following the majority of youths who, as if in a stupor, march along with this world toward destruction.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:3, 4</a>.</p>

If you think about it, though, wisdom dictates that we be different. To illustrate: Think of an Olympic athlete. He no doubt had to be different to get to that level. He likely had to deny himself many things that would consume his time and attention, limiting how much he could train. On the other hand, his being willing to be different from his peers would allow him to train more and to reach his goal.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The world’s view of life is shortsighted. If you take a long-range view, being different from the world and abstaining from its morally and spiritually destructive activities, you will “get a firm hold on the real life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:19</a>) The sister mentioned earlier says: “If you stand up for what you believe, you’ll really feel great at the end of the day.

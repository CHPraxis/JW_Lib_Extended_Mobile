DO YOU REMEMBER?




Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
Is cremation proper for Christians?
Whether to cremate or not is a personal decision. Though the Bible does not comment directly on this practice, it is worth noting that the dead bodies of King Saul and his son Jonathan were burned and then buried. (1 Sam. 31:2, 8-13)—6/15, page 7.
How can we be sure that God does not cause bad things to happen?
God is righteous in all his ways. He is just, faithful, and upright. Jehovah is also tender in affection and merciful. (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 145:17; Jas. 5:11)—7/1, page 4.
What challenges might one face when moving to a foreign land to serve where the need is greater?
Three challenges are (1) adapting to a different lifestyle, (2) coping with homesickness, and (3) fitting in with the local brothers. Many who have met these challenges have been richly blessed.—7/15, pages 4-5.
Why did Joseph’s brothers turn on him?
For one thing, Jacob showed Joseph special favor, giving him a special robe. Joseph’s brothers became jealous and sold him into slavery.—8/1, pages 11-13.
Why are the new tracts so effective and easy to use?
All of them follow the same format. Each tract prompts us to read a Bible text and present the householder with a question. Whatever he answers, we can turn to the inside and show him what the Bible says. We can also point out a question for a return visit.—8/15, pages 13-14.
What is the Syriac Peshitta?
Syriac, an Aramaic dialect, came into wide use in the second or third century C.E. It seems that Syriac was the first language into which parts of the Christian Greek Scriptures were translated. The Bible in Syriac became known as the Peshitta.—9/1, pages 13-14.
What can Christian parents do to shepherd their children?
It is vital to listen to children so as to know them. Strive to feed them spiritually. Guide them lovingly, for example, when they try to come to grips with spiritual doubts.—9/15, pages 18-21.
Under God’s Kingdom, what things will be no more?
Health problems, death, unemployment, war, food shortages, and poverty will be no more.—10/1, pages 6-7.
What covenant in the Bible allows others to rule with Christ?
After the last Passover meal with the apostles, Jesus made a covenant with his faithful disciples that can be referred to as the Kingdom covenant. (Luke 22:28-30) It assured them that they would rule with Jesus in heaven.—10/15, pages 16-17.
Give two Bible examples that prove that Satan is real.
The Scriptures say that Satan spoke with Jesus in an effort to tempt him. Also, in Job’s day, Satan spoke with God. These accounts prove that Satan is a real person.—11/1, pages 4-5.
Who were the “people for his name” that James spoke of, as stated at Acts 15:14?
These were the Jewish and non-Jewish believers whom God selected to be a chosen race to “declare abroad the excellencies” of the One who called them. (1 Pet. 2:9, 10)—11/15, pages 24-25.
Where was Timgad, and what attitude did some there have?
Timgad was a large Roman city in North Africa (modern-day Algeria). Showing what some there believed, an excavated inscription reads: “Hunting, Bathing, Playing, Laughing—That’s Living!” That is similar to the view mentioned at 1 Corinthians 15:32.—12/1, pages 8-10.

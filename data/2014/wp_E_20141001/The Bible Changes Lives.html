<h2 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>MY PAST:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> For the first few years of my life, my family lived near Leipzig, East Germany, not far from the Czech and Polish borders. When I was six years old, my father’s work took us abroad<wbr />—first to Brazil and then to Ecuador.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At age 14, I was sent to a boarding school in Germany. Because my parents were far away in South America, I had to look out for myself. I became very self-reliant. I gave little thought to how my actions affected others.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When I was 17 years old, my parents returned to Germany. At first, I lived under their roof. But my independent attitude made it impossible for me to integrate back into the family. At the age of 18, I left home.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I became increasingly restless, searching for a purpose in life. After observing various lifestyles and movements, I became convinced that the best thing I could do with my life was to use it to explore this beautiful planet before humanity destroys it.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">I left Germany, bought a motorcycle, and headed for Africa. Soon, though, I had to return to Europe for repairs to my motorcycle. Shortly thereafter, I found myself on a beach in Portugal. I decided to leave my motorcycle behind and find a floating means of transportation.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I joined a group of young people who were preparing to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Among them I met my future wife, Laurie. First, we sailed to the islands of the Caribbean. Then, after a short stay in Puerto Rico, we returned to Europe. We hoped to find a sailboat that we could convert into a recreational boat. But after a short search of just three months, the project came to an abrupt end. I was drafted by the German military.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">I spent 15 months in the German navy. During that time, Laurie and I got married and prepared to continue our traveling lifestyle. Shortly before my military service, we had purchased the hull of a lifeboat. While I was serving in the military, we progressively converted the hull <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>into a small sailing vessel. We planned to live in it and keep exploring this beautiful planet. It was at this point<wbr />—after my military service but before finishing the vessel—<wbr />that we were contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses and began to study the Bible.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="14" class="p14 sn"> At first, I didn’t see the need to change much in my life. I was married to the woman with whom I was living, and I had already stopped smoking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:5</a>) As for our plans to travel the world, I thought that devoting our lives to observing God’s marvelous creation was certainly a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In reality, however, I did need to make changes<wbr />—especially to my personality. Being extremely proud and self-reliant, I was completely absorbed in my own abilities and accomplishments. My life was all about me.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">One day, I read Jesus’ famous Sermon on the Mount. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:1-40:7:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew, chapters 5-7</a>) Initially, I was puzzled by the happinesses Jesus spoke about. For example, he said that happiness belongs to those who are hungry and thirsty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:6-40:5:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:6</a>) I wondered how being in need could make a person happy. As I continued to study, I came to realize that we all have a spiritual need but that we must humbly acknowledge that need before we can have it filled. It is as Jesus said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">After beginning our Bible study in Germany, Laurie and I moved to France, and later, to Italy. Wherever we went, we found Jehovah’s Witnesses. I was deeply impressed by their sincere love for one another and their unity. I saw that the Witnesses really are a global brotherhood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) In time, Laurie and I were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">After baptism, I continued to make changes in my personality. Laurie and I had decided to sail down the African coast and then across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. It was out there on the ocean<wbr />—just the two of us in a tiny boat surrounded by thousands of miles of water—<wbr />that I realized how insignificant I am compared to our magnificent Creator. Having a lot of time on my hands (there isn’t much to do out in the middle of the ocean), I devoted myself to reading the Bible. I was especially moved by the accounts of Jesus’ life on earth. He was a perfect man with abilities far beyond anything I could imagine, yet he never promoted himself. His life was not about himself but about his heavenly Father.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sc">I saw that I needed to put God’s Kingdom first in my life</p>
</div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">As I meditated on Jesus’ example, I saw that I needed to put God’s Kingdom first in my life rather than fitting it in around the various things that I wanted to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>) When Laurie and I finally reached land in the United States, we decided to settle down there and focus on our worship.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>HOW I HAVE BENEFITED:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="20" class="p20 sn"> My former, egocentric lifestyle came with a large dose of uncertainty. Now, however, I have found a source of unerring wisdom to guide me. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>) I have also gained a purpose in life that I never had before<wbr />—worshipping God and helping others to learn about him.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">By applying Bible principles, Laurie and I have strengthened our marriage substantially. We have also been blessed with a beautiful daughter, who has grown to know and love Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">It’s not that our life has always been smooth sailing. But with Jehovah’s help, we are determined never to give up or stop trusting in him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>.</p>

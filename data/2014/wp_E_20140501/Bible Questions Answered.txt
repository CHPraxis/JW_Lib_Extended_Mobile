BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Who really rules this world?






If God were the ruler of this world, would there be so much suffering?





Many people believe that the true God is the ruler of this world. But if that were true, would the earth be so filled with suffering? (Deuteronomy 32:4, 5) According to the Bible, the world is under the control of someone evil.—Read 1 John 5:19.
How did someone evil gain control over mankind? At the beginning of human history, an angel rebelled against God and urged the first human pair to rebel too. (Genesis 3:1-6) The couple chose to obey that rebel angel, Satan, making him their ruler. Almighty God is the only rightful Ruler, but he wants people to choose his rulership because they love him. (Deuteronomy 6:6; 30:16, 19) Sadly, most of mankind have been misled into making the same bad choice as did the first human pair.—Read Revelation 12:9.



Who will resolve man’s problems?

Will God allow Satan to continue his wicked rule? No! God will use Jesus to undo the evil that Satan has done.—Read 1 John 3:8.
Empowered by God, Jesus will destroy Satan. (Romans 16:20) Then, God will rule mankind and restore the human race to the life of happiness and peace he originally intended.—Read Revelation 21:3-5.

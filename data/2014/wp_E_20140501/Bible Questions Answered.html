<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many people believe that the true God is the ruler of this world. But if that were true, would the earth be so filled with suffering? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4, 5</a>) According to the Bible, the world is under the control of someone evil.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 5:19</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How did someone evil gain control over mankind? At the beginning of human history, an angel rebelled against God and urged the first human pair to rebel too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) The couple chose to obey that rebel angel, Satan, making him their ruler. Almighty God is the only rightful Ruler, but he wants people to choose his rulership because they love him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:6-5:6:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:30:16-5:30:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:30:19-5:30:19" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 19</a>) Sadly, most of mankind have been misled into making the same bad choice as did the first human pair.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 12:9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

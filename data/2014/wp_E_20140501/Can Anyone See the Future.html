<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We all think about the future. We wonder what life will be like for ourselves and our loved ones. We ask such questions as these: ‘Will my children live in a better world? Will the earth be destroyed in a disaster? Is there something I can change now to make my future better?’ This curiosity is part of who we are; we naturally yearn for reassurance, certainty, order, and stability. If you could be more certain about the future, you could prepare for it, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So, what is in your future? Can anyone know? Professionals who try to predict the future have met with some successes but also many failures. Yet, it is said that God can accurately foretell upcoming events. His Word says: “From the beginning I foretell the outcome, and from long ago the things that have not yet been done.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10</a>) How successful has he been?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why should you be interested in the success rate of God’s ancient prophecies? Well, if you found a weather forecaster to be accurate every day for a long time, you would be impressed. Likely you would pay attention to what he said about the weather tomorrow. In a similar way, if you were to learn that God has foretold events with a perfect rate of success, you would surely be interested in what he foretells about your future.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>THE DESTRUCTION OF A GREAT CITY:</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> For example, it would really be a remarkable feat to predict accurately that a great city, powerful for many centuries, would soon collapse. Through one of his spokesmen, God foretold just such a thing<wbr />—the desolation of Nineveh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:2:13-36:2:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:13-15</a>) What have secular historians recorded? In the <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>seventh century B.C.E., evidently some 15 years after God made his prediction, the Babylonians and the Medes attacked and overthrew Nineveh. Additionally, God specified in advance that Nineveh would be made “desolate, as dry as a desert.” Did this advance notice prove to be accurate? Yes. Although the city and its suburbs may have covered some 200 square miles (518 sq km), the conquerors did not preserve and make use of the city, as might be expected. Instead, they destroyed it. Could any political analyst have predicted those events with such accuracy?</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>HUMAN BONES WILL BURN:</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="8" class="p8 sn"> Who would be so daring as to announce<wbr />—300 years in advance—<wbr />the exact name and specific ancestry of a man who would burn human bones on an altar, as well as the name of the town where the altar would be located? If such an unusual prediction came true, it would surely make the forecaster famous. God’s spokesman announced: “A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David . . . , and he will burn human bones” on an altar in the town of Bethel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:13:1-11:13:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Kings 13:1, 2</a>) About three centuries later, a king named Josiah<wbr />—not a common Biblical name—<wbr />came from the family lineage of David. Exactly as foretold, Josiah had “bones taken from the graves and burned them on the altar” located in Bethel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:14-12:23:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:14-16</a>) How could anyone foretell such specific details unless guided by a superhuman source?</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>THE END OF AN EMPIRE:</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="9" class="p9 sn"> It would be amazing if a person could successfully predict the name of a man<wbr />—long before his birth—<wbr />who would organize the overthrow of a major world power, even indicating the unusual strategy that he would employ. God announced that a man named Cyrus would launch the conquest of a nation. This Cyrus would also free Jewish captives and support the reconstruction of their holy temple. Additionally, God foretold that Cyrus’ battle strategy would include the drying up of rivers and indicated that gates would be left open, facilitating the <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>conquest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:44:27-23:45:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27–45:2</a>) Were the many details of God’s prophecy fulfilled accurately? Historians agree that this conquest by Cyrus actually occurred. Cyrus’ army employed the tremendous engineering feat of diverting one of Babylon’s waterways<wbr />—in effect, drying up rivers. What is more, the army entered the city through gates that had been left open. Cyrus thereafter freed the Jewish people and declared that they could rebuild their temple in Jerusalem. That was unusual, for Cyrus did not worship the God of the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/15:1:1-15:1:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-3</a>) Who but God could have predicted the details of those historical events?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">We have mentioned three examples showing how God successfully foretold future events. These are not isolated incidents. The Jewish leader Joshua stated a fact that was well-known to his large audience: “You well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:1-6:23:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 23:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Joshua’s people could not deny the success rate of God’s promises and prophecies. But how does God do it? There are major differences between God’s ways and man’s. This is important for you to know, for God has made some epic announcements about the near future that will definitely affect you.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>GOD’S PROPHECIES VERSUS HUMAN PREDICTIONS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Human predictions are often based on such factors as scientific research, analysis of available facts and trends, or even bogus spiritual insight. After making their forecasts, humans typically sit back passively and wait to see what will happen.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:1-20:27:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In contrast to humans, God knows all the facts. He thoroughly understands the nature and inclination of humans; therefore, when he chooses to do so, God can foresee exactly how individuals and entire nations will act. But God can do more than that. He can even control and change factors and trends to ensure the outcome. He says: “My word that goes out of my mouth . . . will not return to me without results, . . . and it will have sure success.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>) In a way, then, some of God’s predictions are more like announcements or declarations. He actively guarantees a perfect record of success.</p>

<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>YOUR FUTURE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Is there a reliable forecast involving your future and that of your loved ones? If you have advance knowledge of an approaching hurricane, you can take lifesaving action. You can respond similarly to Bible prophecy. God has announced that huge worldwide changes will come soon. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2014323/20-26">What God Has Revealed About the Future</a>.”) This future is quite different from what many so-called experts forecast.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">You might think of it this way: The story of this world has an overall plot. It has already been written, and you can preview the finale. God declares: “From the beginning I foretell the outcome, . . . I say, ‘My decision will stand, and I will do whatever I please.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10</a>) You and your family can have a wonderful future. Ask Jehovah’s Witnesses about what the Bible says regarding upcoming events. The Witnesses are not psychics; nor do they claim to hear spirit voices or to have any special powers of prediction. They are students of the Bible who can show you the good things that God is actively arranging for your future.</p>

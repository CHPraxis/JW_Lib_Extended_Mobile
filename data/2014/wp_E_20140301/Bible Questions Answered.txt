BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



How does Jesus’ death benefit us?

When God created humans, he intended for them to live forever on earth without ever suffering sickness or death. However, the first man, Adam, disobeyed the Creator and lost the prospect of living forever. As descendants of Adam, we inherited death from him. (Romans 5:8, 12; 6:23) The true God, Jehovah, sent his Son, Jesus, to the earth to die and redeem what Adam had lost.—Read John 3:16.
Jesus died to make everlasting life possible for mankind. How would you picture life without end on earth?

Jesus’ death makes forgiveness of our sins and life without end possible for us. The Bible gives us a picture of what life on earth will be like when we are no longer afflicted by aging, disease, and death.—Read Isaiah 25:8; 33:24; Revelation 21:4, 5.



How should we remember Jesus’ death?

The evening before he died, Jesus told his followers to remember his death by means of a simple ceremony. Commemorating Jesus’ death that way each year allows us to contemplate how much Jesus and Jehovah love mankind.—Read Luke 22:19, 20; 1 John 4:9, 10.

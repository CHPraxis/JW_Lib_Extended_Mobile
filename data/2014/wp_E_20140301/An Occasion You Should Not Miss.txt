COVER SUBJECT | WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU
An Occasion You Should Not Miss




On the night before he surrendered his life, Jesus instructed his faithful followers to remember, or commemorate, his sacrifice. Using the unleavened bread and the red wine before them, he instituted what has been called the Last Supper or the Lord’s Evening Meal and commanded: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19.
Each year, Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide gather to commemorate Jesus’ death on its anniversary. In 2014, the Memorial falls on Monday, April 14, after sundown.
You are cordially invited to attend this meeting, during which further information on the significance of Jesus’ sacrificial death will be presented. Attendance at this event is completely free. No collections will be taken. The person who gave you this magazine can tell you the time and location of the Memorial that will be held in your area, or you may consult our Web site, jw.org. Please make a note of the occasion, which we hope you will not miss.

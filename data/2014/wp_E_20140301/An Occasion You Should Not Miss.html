<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On the night before he surrendered his life, Jesus instructed his faithful followers to remember, or commemorate, his sacrifice. Using the unleavened bread and the red wine before them, he instituted what has been called the Last Supper or the Lord’s Evening Meal and commanded: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>.</p>

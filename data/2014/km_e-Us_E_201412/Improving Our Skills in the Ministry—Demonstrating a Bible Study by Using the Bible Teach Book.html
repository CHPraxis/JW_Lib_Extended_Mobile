<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Why Important: </strong>Many people may not understand what we mean when we say that we offer free home Bible studies. They may think that they have to join a study group or take some sort of correspondence course. Instead of simply <em>offering </em>a study, why not <em>demonstrate </em>a study? In just a few minutes, even on the doorstep, you can <em>show </em>a person what an easy and enlightening experience it can be to study the Bible.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">            Mention that many people have similar concerns, and show him the table of contents in the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. Explain that this book has easy-to-understand lessons that show what the Bible teaches about the future and other subjects, and ask him which chapter he is interested in.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">            Hand him a copy of the book, and direct him to the chapter that he selected. Explain that the questions at the beginning of the chapter are answered in the paragraphs that follow.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">            Ask the householder to read the first paragraph if he feels comfortable doing so. Then read the question for that paragraph, and consider the answer together. Look up and discuss scriptures cited in support of the answer. Show him how you have highlighted the answer in your book.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">            Consider the next paragraph, but this time ask the householder to try answering the question in his own words.</p>

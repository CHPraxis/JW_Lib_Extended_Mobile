The Watchtower January 1

“It seems as if corruption in government has always been a problem. Why do you think that is so? [Allow for response.] I found this comment in the Bible to be interesting. [Read Ecclesiastes 7:20.] This magazine highlights the Bible’s solutions to corruption. Please take a little time to read it. Here is your copy.”



Awake! January

“Many people believe that evolution explains how life began, but others are not so sure. How do you think life began? [Allow for response.] Decades of research indicate that life comes only from preexisting life. This agrees with this simple statement found in the Bible. [Read Psalm 36:9.] This magazine discusses why many have concluded that life is too complex and marvelous to be the result of evolution.”



Good News From God!

“We’re visiting the families on your street to share an encouraging thought from the Bible. Many that we’ve talked to wonder why a loving God would allow so much suffering in the world. Do you think that suffering was part of God’s original purpose for the earth?” Allow for response. Turn to Lesson 5, read and discuss the first two paragraphs and the scriptures in italics, and offer the brochure.

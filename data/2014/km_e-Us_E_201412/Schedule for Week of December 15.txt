15 min: “Conducting Effective Bible Studies.” Questions and answers. After considering paragraph 3, have a two-part demonstration showing a publisher and a Bible student discussing paragraph 8 in chapter 15 of the Bible Teach book. In the first demonstration, the publisher talks too much. In the second, the publisher asks viewpoint questions to help him discern the student’s thinking.
15 min: A Tool to Help You Prepare to Conduct Bible Studies. Discussion. Draw the attention of the audience to the section of jw.org entitled “What Does the Bible Teach?” (Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > TEENAGERS.) Discuss how this material can be used to help us conduct effective Bible studies with young people as well as with older ones. How can the questions raised on these work sheets help us reach the student’s heart? Include a soliloquy of a publisher using one of these work sheets to help him think about the needs of his student and prepare effective questions. Conclude by encouraging the audience to become better teachers by endeavoring to reach their students’ hearts by using the good things we have to help others.—Prov. 20:5.

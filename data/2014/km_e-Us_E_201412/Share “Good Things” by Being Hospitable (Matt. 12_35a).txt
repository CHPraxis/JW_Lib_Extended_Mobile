Share “Good Things” by Being Hospitable (Matt. 12:35a)




All of us undoubtedly want to share “good things” with others by following “the course of hospitality.” (Rom. 12:13) The elders take the lead in arranging for visiting speakers to receive hospitality and reimbursement for their travel expenses. However, we personally might hesitate to show hospitality because of having limited means, or we might feel anxious about having others come to our home. Our taking to heart Jesus’ counsel to Martha can help us overcome such feelings. (Luke 10:39-42) He emphasized that “the good portion” of hospitality is the fellowship and encouragement, not an elaborate meal or fine home decor. By applying this counsel, we all can share “good things” with our brothers in accord with God’s Word.—3 John 5-8.

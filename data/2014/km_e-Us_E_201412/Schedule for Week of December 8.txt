10 min: “Good Things” in Store for Us This Month. Talk. Highlight monthly theme. (Matt. 12:35a) We received spiritual treasures from someone who taught us the truth. (See The Watchtower, April 1, 2002, p. 16, pars. 5-7.) In turn, we should share our “good things” with others. (Gal. 6:6) Arouse interest in the “good things” we will receive this month at upcoming Service Meetings. We will be helped to develop our teaching skills as well as learn to sing new songs.
20 min: “Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Demonstrating a Bible Study by Using the Bible Teach Book.” Discussion. Have a well-qualified publisher or a pioneer demonstrate a Bible study using the Bible Teach book.
Song 96 and Prayer

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">ON Pentecost of the year 33, Jehovah made a historic change. He created a new nation called “the Israel of God,” or spiritual Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a>) Jehovah used his holy spirit to select the individual members of this nation. Paul wrote that those in this new nation do not need to be circumcised as the descendants of Abraham did. Instead, their “circumcision is that of the heart” by holy spirit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:29-45:2:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 2:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The first members of God’s new nation were the apostles and over a hundred other disciples of Christ who had met together in an upper room in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:12-44:1:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 1:12-15</a>) God poured out holy spirit on them, and they became sons of God.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah used the apostle Peter to invite Jews and proselytes to become members of His new nation, the congregation of anointed Christians. On the day of Pentecost, Peter boldly told the Jews that they had killed Jesus and that now they needed to accept him as their “Lord and Christ.” When the crowd asked what they should do, Peter told them: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:22-44:2:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:22, 23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:36-44:2:38" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 36-38</a>) That day, about 3,000 people became part of the new nation of spiritual Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:41</a>) Afterward, the apostles continued to preach with zeal, and more people accepted the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 6:7</a>) The new nation was growing.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Later, Jesus’ disciples began preaching to the Samaritans. Many of them accepted the truth and were baptized, but they did not receive the holy spirit. The governing body in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to visit these new Samaritan brothers and sisters. These two apostles laid their hands on them, “and they began to receive holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:8:5-44:8:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 8:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 14-17</a>) In this way, these Samaritans were <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>anointed and became members of spiritual Israel.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>At a meeting of the governing body in the year 49, the disciple James said: “Symeon [Peter] has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) This new “people for his name” included Jewish and non-Jewish Christians whom God formed into one nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:11:25-45:11:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 11:25, 26a</a>) Later, Peter wrote: “You were once not a people, but now you are God’s people.” Peter explained the purpose of this new nation by saying: “You are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies’ of the One who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9, 10</a>) They had to be courageous witnesses for Jehovah and publicly praise him as the Universal Sovereign.</p>

They have followed pagan rituals and taught doctrines that are not from the Bible. They have fought so-called holy wars and claimed to have been fighting for God. They have been corrupt and sexually immoral. For hundreds of years after the apostasy began, there were only a few faithful worshippers of Jehovah on the earth and no <strong>organized </strong>group who were “a people for his name.”</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jesus used his parable of the wheat and the weeds to foretell that the apostasy would make it very difficult to identify the true religion. He said that “while men were sleeping,” the Devil would plant weeds in the field where the Son of man had sown wheat seeds. The wheat and the weeds would grow together until “the conclusion of the system of things.” He explained that “the fine seed” means “the sons of the Kingdom” and that “the weeds” are “the sons of the wicked one.” During the time of the end, the Son of man would send angels to separate the weeds from the wheat. Then the angels would gather the sons of the Kingdom.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>“The conclusion of the system of things” began in 1914. At that time, there were only a few thousand anointed Christians on earth. During the war that began that year, these anointed “sons of the Kingdom” were still in captivity to Babylon the Great. But in 1919, Jehovah freed them, and the difference between these true Christians and false Christians became very clear. He gathered “the sons of the Kingdom” to be an organized people, just as Isaiah had prophesied: “Will a land be brought to birth in one day? Or will a nation be born all at once? Yet, as soon as Zion went into labor, she gave birth to her sons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:66:8-23:66:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 66:8</a>) In this context, <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>Zion is Jehovah’s organization of angels.

Some think that God cannot approve of these religions because they do not teach the truth about God and they do terrible things. Still, they often believe that God accepts good people in all religions. But is this true? Or does God require that those who worship him be separate from false religions? Let us find the answer by seeing what the Bible says about Jehovah’s true worshippers throughout history.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The Israelites worshipped their God, Jehovah, but other nations worshipped their own gods. So an important question needed to be answered: Who was the true God? In Isaiah’s day, Jehovah said that this question had to be answered in the same way that a legal question is answered in a court trial. He said that if the gods of the nations were real, they should provide their own witnesses for this trial. He said: “Let them present their witnesses to prove themselves right, or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:9-23:43:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The gods of the nations could not prove that they were real.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:5-23:46:7" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:5-7</a>) But Jehovah told his people Israel: “You are my witnesses, . . . yes, my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and have faith in me and understand that I am the same One. Before me no God was formed, and after me there <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>has been none.

Because Jehovah had freed Israel from Egypt, he expected them to obey him willingly and glorify him as their Sovereign. Jehovah expects the same from his people today.

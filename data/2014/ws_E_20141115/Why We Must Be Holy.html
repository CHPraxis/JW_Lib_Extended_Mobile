<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Leviticus, written by Moses, is part of “all Scripture” that is “beneficial for teaching.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) Jehovah’s name is mentioned about ten times in each chapter of this book.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:22:32-3:22:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Leviticus 22:32</a>) The phrase “I am Jehovah,” which is repeated many times in this book, should remind us to obey God.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:8:5-3:8:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 8:5, 6</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jehovah appointed Aaron to <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>be Israel’s high priest, and his sons were to be priests for the nation. Aaron represents Jesus, and Aaron’s sons represent anointed Christians. What did the washing of Aaron mean? Did it mean that Jesus needed to be cleansed? No. Jesus was sinless and “without blemish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9:14</a>) However, after Aaron was washed, he represented Jesus, who is clean and righteous. So, what does the washing of Aaron’s sons represent?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The washing of Aaron’s sons represents the cleansing of those who are selected to be priests in heaven. Is this cleansing connected with their baptism? No, because baptism does not wash away sins. Instead, baptism is a symbol of a person’s dedication to God. The anointed are cleansed “by means of the word,” so they must apply Christ’s teachings fully in their lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:25-49:5:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>) In this way, they are holy and clean. But what about the “other sheep”?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Aaron’s sons did not represent the “great crowd” of Jesus’ other sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>) Yet, the other sheep too become holy and clean by means of God’s Word. When those with the earthly hope put faith in what the Bible says about the power of Jesus’ sacrifice, they are motivated to worship Jehovah “day and night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:13-66:7:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 7:13-15</a>) The cleansing of the anointed and the other sheep is continual.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:12</a>) Jehovah is pleased when he sees <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>that all of his people are clean and united as they obey and loyally follow their Shepherd, Jesus!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why must we examine ourselves regularly?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>What does the fact that Israel’s priests had to be physically clean mean for us today? Many people with whom we study the Bible notice that we are neat and clean and that we also keep our places of worship clean. In addition, those who want to worship Jehovah must have “a pure heart.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:24:3-19:24:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 24:3, 4;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>.) So we must serve Jehovah with clean minds and hearts as well as with clean bodies. We need to examine ourselves regularly. At times we may find that we need to make major changes in order to be holy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) For example, a baptized person who views pornography should ask himself, ‘Am I proving myself holy?’ He should then get help to stop this wicked practice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">James 5:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Let us examine the words of three brothers who for many years have worked closely with members of the Governing Body. One brother mentioned: “While this has indeed been a unique privilege of service, the close association has from time to time revealed that, although spirit anointed, these brothers are imperfect. Yet, one of my goals over the years has been to be obedient to those taking the lead.” The second brother said: “Such scriptures as <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:10:5-47:10:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, about ‘obedience to Christ,’ have helped me to be obedient and cooperate with those taking the lead. This is obedience from the heart.” The third brother said: “Loving what Jehovah loves and hating what he hates, as well as constantly seeking his guidance and doing what pleases him, means obedience to his organization and to those he is using to advance his purpose for the earth.” This brother remembers the example of Nathan Knorr. Brother Knorr, who became a member of the Governing Body, accepted what was said in the 1925 <em>Watch Tower </em>article “Birth of the Nation,” even though others questioned it. Such obedience truly impressed the brother. Meditating on the words of these three brothers can help you to be obedient to God and remain holy.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why can we say that Atonement Day was more than a ritual?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What Israel’s high priest did once a year on Atonement Day helps us to understand how God views blood. Blood was used only for a special purpose. It was used for forgiveness of sins so that the Israelites could have a peaceful relationship with God. The blood of the bull and the goat was sprinkled in front of the cover of the ark of the covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:14-3:16:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:19-3:16:19" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 19</a>) By means of that blood, God would forgive the sins of the Israelites. Jehovah also said that if a man killed an animal for food, its blood was to be poured out on the ground and covered with dust, because “the life of every sort of flesh is its blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:17:11-3:17:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:11-14</a>) These commands were not unimportant rituals. Hundreds of years earlier, God had prohibited Noah and his descendants from eating blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:9:3-1:9:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Genesis 9:3-6</a>) What does this mean for Christians?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How does Paul connect blood with forgiveness?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul explained that <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>blood had the power to cleanse when he wrote: “According to the Law nearly all things are cleansed with blood, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:22-58:9:22" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:22</a>) But the value of animal sacrifices was temporary. Paul mentioned that these sacrifices reminded the Israelites that they were sinners and that they needed a greater sacrifice to remove their sins completely. The Law was “a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>) So how would forgiveness of sins be possible?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What does Jesus’ presenting the value of his blood to Jehovah mean to you?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 1:7</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jesus died as a sacrifice for all humans, and this has great meaning for those who love him and his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Galatians 2:20</a>) Yet, it was what Jesus did <strong>after </strong>his resurrection that saved us from sin, as illustrated by what happened on Atonement Day. When the high priest went into the Most Holy, it was as if he entered into God’s presence. There, the priest presented the blood of the animals to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:11-3:16:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:11-15</a>) After his resurrection, Jesus entered into heaven and <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>presented the value of his human blood to God.

Blood represents life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4</a>) No doubt you will agree that we should view blood the way God does and that we should obey his command to abstain from it.

We would never want to make Jehovah sad by accepting something that he condemns! Today many doctors and others encourage us to give our own blood with the hope of saving lives. But as God’s holy people, we know that Jehovah has the right to say how blood should be used. To him, “any sort of blood” is sacred. So we must be determined to obey his law on blood.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  The Resurrection of Jesus—Its Meaning for Us
In this article we will learn why we can be sure that Jesus was resurrected and is alive today. We will also learn how the resurrection of Christ to immortal life in heaven should affect us and our ministry.

▪  Why We Must Be Holy
▪  We Must Be Holy in All Our Conduct
These articles discuss the Bible book of Leviticus. They show why Jehovah expects his people to be holy and how we can remain holy in all our conduct.

▪  “The People Whose God Is Jehovah”
▪  “Now You Are God’s People”
It is difficult for some who study the Bible with us to believe that Jehovah has only one organization on earth. They think that they can belong to any religion and still please God as long as they are sincere. These articles explain why we should know who God’s people are and why we should serve Jehovah with them.

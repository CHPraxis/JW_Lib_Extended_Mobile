UNIT 10 (B)
Think in Terms of Bible Principles



OPENING DISCUSSION

Principles are fundamental truths that never change, regardless of time or circumstance. They provide the basis on which specific laws are founded. The Universal Sovereign established many principles before creation. Therefore, everything in heaven and on earth, animate or inanimate, has been designed to function according to Jehovah’s unchangeable principles. When all things function within the framework of his principles, there is harmony that reflects his glory, and Jehovah can bestow his blessing.
Principles are living, essential truths, and a wise Christian learns to love them. Understanding Bible principles is the key to our making sound decisions that reflect godly wisdom.—Prov. 3:6, 21-23; 4:7; w02 4/15 pp. 18-23; w02 2/15 pp. 4-7.

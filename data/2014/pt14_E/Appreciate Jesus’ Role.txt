UNIT 10 (A)
Appreciate Jesus’ Role



OPENING DISCUSSION

Jesus told his apostles: “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Today, pioneers are having a large share in the fulfillment of that prophecy. When you speak about God’s loving provisions for life, you are bearing witness to Jehovah and to Jesus.
Why should the role of God’s firstborn Son interest us? Because our very relationship with our heavenly Father, Jehovah, is involved. Jesus himself said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) Understanding this pivotal role will build our appreciation for God’s purpose. In addition, we will be moved to help sincere individuals of all backgrounds come to know the one “through whom all things are”—Jesus Christ.—1 Cor. 8:6.

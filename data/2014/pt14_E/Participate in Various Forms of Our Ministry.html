<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus foretold a grand preaching work that would take place during the time of the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) This worldwide preaching activity would constitute part of the sign of Jesus’ presence in Kingdom power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Today we see the Kingdom-preaching work speeding up, with pioneers at the very forefront. This message of truth that we declare opens the way for lovers of righteousness to come into a proper relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>) The Kingdom message also serves to warn the wicked concerning Jehovah God’s judgments soon to come upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult in some lands to find people at home. Challenging economic conditions have forced many to work, resulting in few being at home during the day. Given these circumstances, how can we continue to reach people with the good news? Examining the effective preaching methods of the apostles and other Christian ministers in the first century will help. They zealously took advantage of every opportunity to speak about the Kingdom<wbr />—publicly, informally, and from house to house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:20-44:20:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Acts 20:20, 21</a>) These first-century evangelizers focused on people, not houses. May we do the same and ‘fully accomplish our ministry.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Share the Good News at Every Opportunity<wbr />—Informal Witnessing</strong></h3>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Informal witnessing does not require that we begin the conversation with a formal introduction or a scripture. We may find it helpful to have the goal of simply starting conversations without feeling that we must give a witness at the outset. This may give us confidence to introduce the good news later in the conversation.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="235" href="jwpub://p/E:202010286/1-46"><em>km </em>8/10 pp. 3-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5">EXPERIENCE: A sister who learned the truth through informal witnessing considers her special <span id="page75" class="pageNum" data-no="75" data-before-text="75"></span>territory to be the people she meets through her three children. Her territory includes neighbors and parents she meets at school and at meetings for parents. Whenever she introduces herself, she makes a simple but heartfelt statement that the Bible is a valuable aid to her in rearing her children, and then she moves on to some other topic. But having broken the ice, she finds it much easier to bring the Bible into subsequent discussions. By using this method, she has helped 12 persons to baptism.</p>

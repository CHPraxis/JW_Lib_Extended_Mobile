Persevere in Prayer



OPENING DISCUSSION

Prayer is unique among the loving provisions of Jehovah God. Opposers may confiscate your Bible or prevent you from meeting with fellow worshippers, but no one can rob you of prayer. To overstate the value of prayer is impossible. How important it is, then, for each one of us to cherish and take full advantage of this privilege.
The Bible is not a prayer book. Yet, it could be described as mankind’s greatest textbook on prayer. The Hebrew Scriptures alone contain over 150 prayers. Some are short; others are long. They were uttered in public and in private, by kings and by captives, in triumph and in tribulation. At Psalm 65:2, we read David’s song: “O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.”
You pioneers may need strength and wisdom in special ways because of your own particular circumstances. Your full reliance on Jehovah by means of prayer will help you to deal with life’s challenges. Therefore, this discussion should enhance your understanding of the privilege of prayer and your appreciation for it.



QUESTION OUTLINE

Coming to the “Hearer of Prayer”
What convinces you that Jehovah hears your prayers? (1 Ki. 18:36-38; Acts 12:5-11; Heb. 5:7)
Why did King David say that his prayer should be prepared “as incense”? (Ps. 141:2; Ex. 30:34-38; Rev. 5:8)
Why should we give thought to improving the quality and quantity of our prayers? (Ps. 92:1, 2; 119:147, 164; Eph. 6:18)
We Can Learn From Notable Prayers in the Bible
What shows that although Jesus was a perfect man, he did not rely on his own strength to endure? What confidence did Jesus have in his Father, and why? (Heb. 5:7)
What do you especially appreciate about Jesus’ prayers at Matthew 26:39, 42, 44?
In the account at Luke 6:12, 13, Jesus prayed all night. What can we learn from this?
What is supplication, and concerning what may we supplicate Jehovah? (Phil. 4:6; w13 11/15 p. 4 pars. 6-7)
Why should we look to Jehovah to cope with pressures in this system, and how may we do so? (Matt. 7:7; Phil. 4:13)
What two major problems did Hannah face, and why did each present a challenge? (1 Sam. 1:2) Why did Peninnah want Hannah to suffer, and how did she hurt Hannah? (1 Sam. 1:5-7)
When you face petty meanness or injustice, why is it comforting to remember that Jehovah is the God of justice? Why do we not allow what others do to cause us to stumble? (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 119:165)
How did Hannah pour out her heart to her heavenly Father in prayer? (1 Sam. 1:9, 10)
Rather than speak in generalities, how was Hannah specific in her prayer? What comfort did this bring to her? How can our specific prayers help to unburden our hearts and minds? (1 Sam. 1:11; Ps. 51)
◆ When you are faced with adversity, be specific in your prayers. Regardless of what your problem is, whether it is your domestic situation, loneliness, or ill health, pray to Jehovah about it. Describe to him the exact nature of your difficulty and how you feel.

EXPERIENCE: “Every evening I entrust all my troubles to Jehovah,” says a widow named Louise. “Sometimes there are quite a few, but I clearly mention each one.” (w95 3/15 p. 4)
As Hannah’s example illustrates, what should we keep in mind while praying to God? (Ps. 62:8; 1 Thess. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:7) Why should this build our confidence in Jehovah?
What comfort did Hannah receive by opening her heart to Jehovah? How might we benefit from Hannah’s example when we struggle with negative feelings? (1 Sam. 1:18; Ps. 55:22)
How did Hannah’s second recorded prayer to Jehovah reflect the depth of her faith? When you examine Hannah’s prayer recorded at 1 Samuel 2:1-10, what do you learn about the need to have an intimate relationship with Jehovah? How does her prayer strengthen your faith?
Jehovah’s servants offered notable prayers under a multitude of circumstances. Which of the following situations have you experienced?
• You need guidance from God in carrying out an assignment, as did Eliezer. (Gen. 24:12-14)
• You face opposition from your family, as did Jacob. (Gen. 32:9-12)
• You want to know God better, as did Moses. (Ex. 33:12-17)
• You are confronted with opponents, as was Elijah. (1 Ki. 18:36, 37)
• You find some aspects of the preaching work difficult, as did Jeremiah. (Jer. 20:7-12)
• You feel the need to approach Jehovah to seek his forgiveness, as expressed by Solomon. (1 Ki. 8:38, 39)
• You face persecution, as did Jesus’ disciples. (Acts 4:24-31)
 Future study project: About 180 prayers are recorded in the Bible. Why not research these by means of Watchtower Library, the Index, or the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Analyzing the content of the prayers of other faithful servants will be a source of encouragement to you.—w11 2/15 p. 19.

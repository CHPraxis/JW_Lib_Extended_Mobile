Endurance Leads to an Approved Condition



OPENING DISCUSSION

“You need endurance,” wrote the apostle Paul to the first-century Christians living in Judea. (Heb. 10:36) Emphasizing the importance of this quality, the apostle Peter likewise urged Christians: “Supply to your faith . . . endurance.” (2 Pet. 1:5, 6) What exactly is endurance?
A Greek-English lexicon defines the Greek verb for “endure” as “remain instead of fleeing . . . stand one’s ground, hold out.” Concerning the Greek noun for “endurance,” one reference work says: “It is the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but with blazing hope . . . It is the quality which keeps a man on his feet with his face to the wind. It is the virtue which can transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the goal.”
As Christians, we must endure not only when experiencing severe difficulties or persecution but also when coping with situations in everyday life. Some of you may be dealing with health problems, opposition from family members, or financial difficulties. Perhaps your territory is not as productive as others’ are. Or you may be downhearted because of a constant battle with your own shortcomings. How do you react to such circumstances that call for endurance? Can you maintain your joy while enduring?

EXPERIENCE: Many years ago, a man harassed a brother at work because of his faith. The workmate ridiculed the brother and criticized his religion for months. The brother felt that he could no longer cope with it, so he prayed to Jehovah to help him endure the difficult situation in a Christlike way without returning evil for evil. To the brother’s surprise, the workmate apologized and assured the brother that he would never again speak badly of God in front of him. A short time later, the workmate left the company.
Twenty-four years passed before the brother met his former workmate again. The workmate told him that he had studied the Bible and had become a baptized Witness. He further explained that though many years had gone by, he had never forgotten “that Witness who with so much patience endured constant ridicule of him and his God.”—yb01 p. 60.

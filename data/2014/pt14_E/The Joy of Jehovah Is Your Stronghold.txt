UNIT 16 (A)
The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold



OPENING DISCUSSION

The joy that Jehovah gives is an unfailing stronghold for those walking in his way as integrity keepers. (Prov. 2:6-8; 10:29) To have God-given joy, of course, people must do the divine will. In this regard, consider what happened in Jerusalem in Ezra’s day. The copyist Ezra and others imparted understanding through a meaningful reading of the Law. Then the people were urged: “Go, eat the choice things and drink what is sweet, and send portions of food to those who have nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel sad, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” The Jews applied the knowledge they had gained and held a joyous Festival of Booths, which resulted in “great rejoicing.” (Neh. 8:1-12) Those who had ‘the joy of Jehovah as their stronghold’ gathered strength for his worship and service. God’s people today should be joyful as well. What are some of our present-day reasons for joy?



QUESTION OUTLINE

“Nothing but Joyful” (Deut. 16:15)
What is the definition of joy? (it-2 p. 119)
What is the source of true joy, and how is God’s holy spirit involved? (Deut. 28:47; Prov. 15:13; 17:22; Gal. 5:22)
Why should our close relationship with Jehovah make us the most joyful people on earth? (John 6:44; Eph. 4:18)
How has Jesus’ role contributed to our joyful state? (Rom. 5:8, 18, 19; Col. 1:21-23)
What aspects of our pure worship bring us joy? (John 8:32; 1 Cor. 2:9, 10; Rev. 18:1-8)
◆ Of all the people living on the earth, only those exclusively devoted to Jehovah have his holy spirit and the blessed comprehension of his Word and will. We can be both grateful and joyous that we are granted the progressive understanding indicated in the words of Proverbs 4:18: “The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.”

Why can it be said that joy is not optional? (Deut. 16:13-15; w95 1/15 p. 11 pars. 4-6)
A Life of Purpose
What hope brings great joy, and what are Christians encouraged to do in regard to this hope? (Matt. 6:9, 10; Phil. 4:4; 1 Tim. 1:11)
EXPERIENCE: A pioneer named Janeen says: “Each time I have an opportunity to teach the truth to others, I feel that a deeper impression of these truths is engraved on my mind and heart. As a result, my faith is not stagnant but continues to grow.”
Why is the ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses the most important work being done on earth today? (Isa. 55:6)
How does Jehovah feel about his work, and how do we know that Jehovah wants us to enjoy our work? (Eccl. 5:19; it-2 p. 119)
How did the apostle Paul voice a similar thought about rejoicing? (Phil. 4:4; it-2 p. 119)
To whom does your work bring joy, and why? (Isa. 52:7; Luke 15:10; Acts 20:35; Rom. 10:15)
How might your pioneering bring joy to your family members?
EXPERIENCE: A pioneer with school-age children scheduled her field service activities so that two afternoons a week she could share with her children in the field service after school. She would also encourage them to pioneer during school vacations. All five of her children entered pioneer service after they finished school.
Note to Instructor: Using the latest Yearbook, discuss highlights of the ministry during the past service year worldwide and locally, and remind the pioneers of the important role they played in these good reports.—1 Cor. 3:5-9.

A Blessed Brotherhood
In what ways does our international brotherhood bring you joy? (Hag. 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:5-11)
How has the joy of our brotherhood personally affected your life? (Ps. 133:1; Mark 10:29, 30; 1 Pet. 2:17)
◆ Pioneers help to stabilize the congregation. They assist in caring for midweek meetings for field service and working with those needing assistance. Their conversations, comments, and experiences stimulate others. Pioneers are an example to younger ones. They encourage them to put Kingdom interests first and to set theocratic goals for themselves such as pioneering, Bethel service, and serving where there is a greater need. Pioneers often make time to encourage infirm ones in the congregation. Because of their tact and discernment in dealing with people at the doors, householders become familiar with our message and more receptive to it.—Phil. 2:17.

How can pioneers contribute to the joy of others while increasing their own joy? (Prov. 11:25)
An Unfailing Stronghold
Since joy does not eliminate our difficulties, why is a positive spirit important? (Ps. 59:16, 17; 100:2; Heb. 12:2; Jas. 1:2)
Read and discuss Colossians 1:9-11.
Why may we need to show “patience and joy?” (Matt. 5:10; 1 Pet. 4:13, 14)
How does being assured of Jehovah’s love contribute to our joy? (Ps. 34:18; 1 John 3:19, 20)
How is the joy of Jehovah an unfailing stronghold? (Ps. 18:1, 2, superscription; Rom. 10:10)
Does it not fill you with joy and gratitude to know what Jehovah has done, is doing, and will do for his servants? Indeed, such grand prospects contribute to our joy! Moreover, our blessed hope makes us look to our happy, loving, generous God with sentiments like these: “Look! This is our God! We have hoped in him, and he will save us. This is Jehovah! We have hoped in him. Let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.” (Isa. 25:9) With our splendid hope firmly fixed in mind, let us put forth every effort to serve Jehovah with joy of heart.

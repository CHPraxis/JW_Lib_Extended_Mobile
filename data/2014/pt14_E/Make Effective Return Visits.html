<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many of us are in the truth today because someone patiently made effective return visits on us. We appreciate the personal attention we received. Jesus showed that this is an important part of our work, for he instructed his followers not only to preach but also to “make disciples . . . teaching them.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Teaching differs from preaching in that the teacher does more than proclaim; he instructs, explains, and offers proofs. Therefore, while salvation is still available to interested ones, we must return again and again to cultivate the interest shown.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="280" href="jwpub://p/E:2003843/1-25"><em>w03 </em>11/15 pp. 13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Return visits can be one of the most enjoyable parts of your ministry. Why? Because having had contact with the householder, you know some of the subjects that interest him. You have also had time to choose scriptures that you would like to feature, and the householder knows that you are there to discuss the Bible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What do you think makes for an effective return visit? Have you wondered what other pioneers do? Many have found that three things are needed: (1) showing sincere personal interest, (2) preparing an appealing Bible subject to discuss, and (3) laying the basis for each successive conversation. This unit, along with the accompanying workshop, will bolster your enthusiasm and improve your skills in furthering the interest of those you call back on.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="290" href="jwpub://p/E:202008247/1-8"><em>km </em>7/08 p. 4;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="287" href="jwpub://p/E:201998125/7-9"> <em>km </em>4/98 pp. 3-4 pars. 6-8<em>;</em></a><a class="xt" data-xtid="286" href="jwpub://p/E:201997090/2-10"> <em>km </em>3/97 p. 3 pars. 1-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="se">What effect may our attitude have on others? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:1:6-52:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:6, 7</a>)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se">Why is it important to return when we have promised to do so? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="282" href="jwpub://p/E:2012763/25-25"><em>w12 </em>10/15 p. 31 par. 15</a>)</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5">Initially, what was Ananias’ attitude about calling on Saul (Paul)? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:13-44:9:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 9:13, 14</a>)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5">What was Jesus’ direction? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:15-44:9:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 9:15</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5">What was Ananias’ approach on the call? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:17-44:9:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 9:17</a>) How did he show personal interest?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s6">Why would his visit have been appealing to Saul?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5">From this account, what can we learn about the proper attitude when making return visits?</p>
<h3 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Laying the Groundwork</strong></h3>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="se">Why is it good to teach the householder a Bible truth that will benefit him personally? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="276" href="jwpub://p/E:1102001092/15-15"><em>be </em>p. 159 par. 1</a>)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se">What groundwork for a return visit should we lay in the initial conversation? How can we do so?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5">EXAMPLE: We can easily bring up a subject or raise a question to be considered on the next visit. Perhaps <span id="page102" class="pageNum" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>after describing the Paradise, you could say: “How can we be sure it will really come in our lifetime? Maybe I could stop by in a few days when the rest of the family is at home and show you the answer the Bible gives to that question.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5">What other questions could you raise for consideration in the next conversation?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se">What is the advantage of building anticipation by leaving some questions unanswered until the next discussion?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="se">What do you say to prepare the householder for the next visit?</p>
<h3 id="p27" data-pid="27"><strong>After the Initial Conversation</strong></h3>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="se">How would you determine which scriptures and publications to use in the next conversation?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5">✍ In your house-to-house record, include the content of the conversation and the subject to be discussed when you return. Note the relevant pages of the publication(s) you will use. This specific information will help you to stay enthusiastic about the call and to prepare for future conversations.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="288" href="jwpub://p/E:202000124/3-5"><em>km </em>4/00 p. 8 pars. 2-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="se">How will thinking positively about the person motivate you to return?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><span id="page103" class="pageNum" data-no="103" data-before-text="103"></span>Why might we call back even when no literature has been placed?

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="se">How do you determine the best time to make a return visit?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5">Why is it often wise to make the return visit within a day or two?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5">Relate experiences you have had when making return visits a day or two after locating the interest.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5">EXPERIENCE: One sister makes arrangements to call back on interested persons as soon as possible. But a day or two prior to the appointment, she stops at the home to give the householder a magazine on the subject they discussed. Then the sister explains: “I saw this article and thought you would like to read it. I can’t talk now, but I’ll be back on . . . as we planned. Is that time still all right with you?”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5">Why might this be a good approach?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="se">What can you do when a person cannot be found at home after repeated calls? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="291" href="jwpub://p/E:202011401/5-5"><em>km </em>11/11 p. 1 par. 4</a>)</p>
<h3 id="p40" data-pid="40"><strong>Determine Your Objective</strong></h3>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Our primary objective is to help people become baptized disciples of Christ Jesus. In modern times, the <span id="page104" class="pageNum" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>Bible study arrangement has been the most effective way of reaching this objective. In working toward that goal, be sure to discuss a Scriptural subject on each return visit. This will increase the householder’s interest in accepting a Bible study and it will make the purpose of our conversations clear.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="se">How might we accomplish our primary objective by setting the following incremental, or short-term, goals?</p>

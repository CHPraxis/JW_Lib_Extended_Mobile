UNIT 4 (A)
Uphold Jehovah’s Sovereignty



OPENING DISCUSSION

The majority of mankind today follow a course of self-determination. Personal freedom and doing what is right in one’s own eyes are valued above all else. This course of independence has resulted in confusion, rebellion, and moral breakdown.
In sharp contrast, you chose to love and respect Jehovah and to uphold his rightful sovereignty. This is evidence of your spirituality, and it is most pleasing to our heavenly Father. Additionally, you are happy and are truly blessed as a result of ‘walking in the law of Jehovah.’—Ps. 119:1.
As a pioneer, you have special opportunities to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty in your ministry. Your work and example teach others that Jehovah’s rule is not a burden, that submitting to it offers rich rewards, and that it is worthy of your complete support.—Rev. 4:11, it-2 pp. 1008-1009.
Each one should ask himself: ‘Am I fully subjecting myself to Jehovah and to his spirit-directed organization? Am I really submissive in everything so as not to be directing my own steps? Am I loyally attached to Jehovah, to his congregation, to my marriage mate, and to my Christian brothers and sisters? Am I living my entire life in full recognition of Jehovah’s sovereignty?’

What evidence of independent thinking do you observe in the world around you today?
What does the independent person fail to realize about his standing before Jehovah, as indicated at Romans 1:24, 26, 28 and Colossians 1:21?
As suggested at 2 Corinthians 11:14, 15, what deception overtakes such a person?
As readily admitted by Jeremiah, why is man unable to direct his own step successfully? (Jer. 10:23) How can you show that you really want to subject yourself to Jehovah’s sovereignty? (Ps. 119:105; 143:10; Isa. 54:13)
Subjection to Jehovah Requires Loyalty
Describe “loyalty” as used in the Bible. (it-2 p. 280)
How has Jehovah demonstrated that he is loyal? (Jer. 3:12; Rev. 15:4; it-2 pp. 280-281)
How can we gain strength from reflecting on God’s acts of loyalty? (w13 6/15 pp. 17-18 pars. 4-6)
How do we manifest loyalty when we apply the following scriptures?

Colossians 3:18
Hebrews 13:17
How can you show yourself to be loyal when others speak against Jehovah, his Word, the congregation, or your Christian brothers?
How does the principle recorded at Acts 10:34, 35 help you to be loyal when confronted with expressions of racism, nationalism, and so forth?
In times of persecution, how can we show that we are truly loyal? (John 15:13; Acts 9:23-25; Rev. 2:10)
Godly Subjection Must Be From the Heart
Discuss the principle found at 1 Peter 1:22, and apply it to the following situations: (w93 10/15 pp. 12-16)
• A brother avoids associating with a member of the congregation because he is of another race, nationality, or social standing.
• At the Kingdom Hall, a sister sits on the side opposite someone whom she does not personally like, or for a similar reason, she switches to a different congregation.
How would you show proper subjection to Jehovah’s sovereignty from the heart when . . .
• reading books or magazines?
• selecting entertainment, including TV programs and movies?
• using electronic devices or the Internet?
• in the privacy of your own home with your mate and family?
• caring for duties and assignments in the congregation?
How are we affected when we cultivate love for Jehovah’s ways and obey him because this is truly what is in our heart? (Prov. 4:4, 10-13)
◆ Showing godly subjection should never depend on what others see or on a fear of being discovered.

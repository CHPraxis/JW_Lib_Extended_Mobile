<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Pioneers can take a lesson from the Master Teacher, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:40-42:6:40" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 6:40</a>) Whether Jesus was speaking to a crowd on a mountainside or to just a few people as they walked on the road, what he said and the way he said it made a lasting impression. Jesus stimulated the minds and hearts of his listeners, and he made practical application that they could understand. Can you accomplish similar things?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 24:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In order to fulfill our commission to make disciples, we should have a strong desire to improve in our teaching ability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>) The apostle Paul emphasized the importance of this skill when he said: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The work of teaching others has brought joy to thousands of Jehovah’s people who have had the privilege of conducting progressive Bible studies. As an effective teacher, you are able to reach the hearts of your listeners and to help them progressively to understand, appreciate, and act on what they learn. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:16</a> assures us that our teaching results in the saving of lives<wbr />—all to Jehovah’s praise. What greater motivation could we have?</p>

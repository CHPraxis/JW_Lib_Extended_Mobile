Jehovah Blesses Those Trusting in Him



OPENING DISCUSSION

God’s Word urges us: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he will make your paths straight.” (Prov. 3:5, 6) No one in the universe is more trustworthy than our heavenly Father. Nevertheless, it is easier to read these words in Proverbs than to put them into practice.
◆ Trust is defined as “assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.”—Webster’s Eleventh New Collegiate Dictionary.

Proverbs 3:5 contrasts trusting in Jehovah with leaning on our own understanding, suggesting that we cannot do both. Jehovah gives us powers of understanding, and he expects us to use these in serving him. (Rom. 12:1) Do we trust Jehovah’s wisdom for what it is—infinitely superior to our own? (Isa. 55:8, 9) To “trust in Jehovah” means to let his thinking guide our thought processes. We take notice of him in ‘all our ways,’ not just when we face difficult circumstances. Jehovah blesses those who put their complete trust in him.

Explain why the meaning or definition of Jehovah’s name is a significant reason for putting trust in him? (Ex. 3:14; ftn.; 6:2-8)
Why is Jehovah the epitome of truth? Give examples of Jehovah’s reliability and integrity. (1 Ki. 8:56; Ps. 31:5; Heb. 6:18)
How did Jehovah demonstrate that he trusted his Son, and what was this confidence based on? (Isa. 53:3-7, 10-12; John 8:29; Acts 8:32-35)

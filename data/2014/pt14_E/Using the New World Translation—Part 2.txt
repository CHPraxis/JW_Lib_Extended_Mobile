UNIT 2 (B)
Using the New World Translation—Part 2



OPENING DISCUSSION

In this lesson, we will briefly review a few key points in Appendix A of the revised English New World Translation. Other helpful features of this revision will also be discussed.—Ps. 119:97.



QUESTION OUTLINE

Footnotes (Appendix A2)
Using the scriptures below, explain the value of the four categories of footnotes: (nwt p. 1725)
• “Or” (Job 21:13; Ps. 51:5; Luke 14:26)
• “Or possibly” (Eccl. 7:9; Gal. 5:14)
• “Lit.” (John 2:4)
• Meaning and background information (Gen. 24:32; 25:8; Josh. 3:4; Judg. 7:19)
When a footnote on the same word appears more than once on the same page, the footnotes are combined. Example, Acts 15:20, 29.
What is the value of “See Glossary,” which appears in some footnotes? (Matt. 24:3; Mark 8:34; nwt p. 1723)
Explain the benefit of footnotes that include references to the appendixes, as in John 12:38 and 1 Corinthians 7:17. How do the footnotes contribute to a better understanding of these verses?
Marginal References
Give examples of how we can make use of the information contained in the marginal references.
• Parallel thoughts (Matt. 4:1; Luke 4:1)
• Fulfilled prophecy (Ps. 22:1; Matt. 27:46)
• Direct quotes of phrases, expressions, and entire verses (Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4)
• Law covenant patterns and fulfillments in the Greek Scriptures (Ex. 23:19; 1 Cor. 15:20)
The most relevant marginal references from previous editions are included in the revised English New World Translation. Point out examples as time allows.

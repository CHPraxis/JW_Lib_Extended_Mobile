UNIT 12 (A)
Workshop 3: Make Effective Return Visits

In this workshop we will consider how to
✔ maintain a positive attitude towards return visit work
✔ have a reasonable objective in mind for the return visit
✔ prepare the groundwork for the next conversation




OPENING DISCUSSION

Previous workshops have highlighted ways in which we can show personal interest and ways we can start conversations, as well as the variety of people and places we may encounter as we ‘fully accomplish our ministry.’ (2 Tim. 4:5; Acts 9:11) Building on this foundation, we will now examine how we can make successful return visits with the goal of starting Bible studies.—1 Cor. 3:6.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Prayer is unique among the loving provisions of Jehovah God. Opposers may confiscate your Bible or prevent you from meeting with fellow worshippers, but no one can rob you of prayer. To overstate the value of prayer is impossible. How important it is, then, for each one of us to cherish and take full advantage of this privilege.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible is not a prayer book. Yet, it could be described as mankind’s greatest textbook on prayer. The Hebrew Scriptures alone contain over 150 prayers. Some are short; others are long. They were uttered in public and in private, by kings and by captives, in triumph and in tribulation. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>, we read David’s song: “O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You pioneers may need strength and wisdom in special ways because of your own particular circumstances. Your full reliance on Jehovah by means of prayer will help you to deal with life’s challenges. Therefore, this discussion should enhance your understanding of the privilege of prayer and your appreciation for it.</p>

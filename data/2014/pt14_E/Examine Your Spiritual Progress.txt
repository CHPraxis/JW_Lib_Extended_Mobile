Examine Your Spiritual Progress



OPENING DISCUSSION

What is a spiritual person? He is God-oriented. He endeavors to learn how Jehovah thinks so that he can bring all his ways into harmony with those of his Creator. The Bible speaks highly of such a person—one who follows God’s ways, is in accord with the spirit, and has “the mind of Christ.”—1 Cor. 2:12-16.
What is needed to become a spiritual person and to continue to make progress as one? It is vital that we know the answer, for the course we choose is more than just a matter of personal inclination.—Rom. 7:21-23; 8:6; 1 Cor. 3:1; w07 8/1 pp. 4-5.

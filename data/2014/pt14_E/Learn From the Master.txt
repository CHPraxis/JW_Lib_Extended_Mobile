UNIT 13 (A)
Learn From the Master



OPENING DISCUSSION

In referring to Jesus, the apostle Peter wrote: “Though you never saw him, you love him.” (1 Pet. 1:8) Why do we agree with that sentiment? It is because Jesus displayed mildness and refreshed others. (Matt. 11:28-30) He showed empathy, was interested in others, and was approachable. He made wise choices in life and was a hard worker. How did Jesus acquire these qualities? Simply put, Jesus learned from his Father, Jehovah. Yes, Jesus perfectly reflected his Father’s divine qualities and, as a result, we are drawn to him.
Jesus, having been taught by Jehovah, likewise teaches us. How do we show that we are truly learning from the Master, Jesus? (Col. 3:23, 24) Can we prove to be a real friend to others, demonstrating empathy as well as courage? (Mark 10:13-16; John 15:11-15) Like Jesus, can we be industrious and keep material things in their proper place? Are we determined to attract others to our way of life by the qualities we display?—John 13:13; it-2 p. 266 par. 1.

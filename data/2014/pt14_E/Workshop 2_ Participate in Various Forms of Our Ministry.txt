UNIT 9 (A)
Workshop 2: Participate in Various Forms of Our Ministry

In this workshop we will consider how to
✔ be prepared for a variety of preaching methods
✔ prepare your heart to speak out on appropriate occasions
✔ develop the skills needed to engage people in conversation




OPENING DISCUSSION

In the first workshop, we discussed the importance of declaring our faith in the house-to-house ministry. This time-tested method proves to be a valuable means of searching out those who are hungering for the truth. This workshop will help you develop effectiveness in other forms of your ministry. In this way, we imitate the example of our first-century counterparts, who took advantage of every opportunity to declare the good news. (Acts 20:20, 21) We are confident that this training session will motivate you to take every appropriate opportunity to spread God’s Kingdom message.—Heb. 13:15.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The joy that Jehovah gives is an unfailing stronghold for those walking in his way as integrity keepers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:6-20:2:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 2:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:10:29-20:10:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10:29</a>) To have God-given joy, of course, people must do the divine will. In this regard, consider what happened in Jerusalem in Ezra’s day. The copyist Ezra and others imparted understanding through a meaningful reading of the Law. Then the people were urged: “Go, eat the choice things and drink what is sweet, and send portions of food to those who have nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel sad, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” The Jews applied the knowledge they had gained and held a joyous Festival of Booths, which resulted in “great rejoicing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:1-16:8:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-12</a>) Those who had ‘the joy of Jehovah as their stronghold’ gathered strength for his worship and service. God’s people today should be joyful as well. What are some of our present-day reasons for joy?</p>

<div class="reviewPoint"><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>◆ </strong>Pioneers help to stabilize the congregation. They assist in caring for midweek meetings for field service and working with those needing assistance. Their conversations, comments, and experiences stimulate others. Pioneers are an example to younger ones. They encourage them to put Kingdom interests first and to set theocratic goals for themselves such as pioneering, Bethel service, and serving where there is a greater need. Pioneers often make time to encourage infirm ones in the congregation. Because of their tact and discernment in dealing with people at the doors, householders become familiar with our message and more receptive to it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:17-50:2:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Phil. 2:17</a>.</p>

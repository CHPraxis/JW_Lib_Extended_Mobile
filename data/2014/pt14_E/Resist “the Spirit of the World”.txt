UNIT 7 (B)
Resist “the Spirit of the World”



OPENING DISCUSSION

Jehovah’s people are engaged in a battle! Our enemy is powerful, cunning, and experienced. He has at his disposal a weapon so effective that it has been used to conquer the majority of humankind. However, we are not powerless, nor are we doomed to defeat. We have a mighty defense that is unbeatable when we avail ourselves of it.
The war we are fighting is not physical; it is spiritual. Our enemy is Satan the Devil, and one of the weapons he uses is “the spirit of the world.” (1 Cor. 2:12) The key to defending ourselves against his attacks is God’s holy spirit. We must seize every opportunity to avail ourselves of God’s spirit and display its fruitage in our lives.—Gal. 5:22, 23.
What is the spirit of the world, and how did it become so pervasive? How can we determine whether the spirit of the world is influencing us? What steps can we take to receive God’s spirit and thereby resist the spirit of the world?

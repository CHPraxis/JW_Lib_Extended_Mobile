UNIT 15 (A)
Help Others “Press On to Maturity”



OPENING DISCUSSION

The birth of a child, a graduation, a marriage—all are milestones. However, in each instance there is still much work to do for those involved to achieve success.
What about your Bible students? Are they able to track their spiritual progress? Have they become unbaptized publishers? Are they baptized? These are truly milestones that bring much joy. However, your students still need your assistance and training. They have just begun a course that we hope will be a lifetime of service to Jehovah. How can we assist them to “press on to maturity”?—Heb. 6:1; 1 Cor. 3:10-13.



QUESTION OUTLINE

Trained to Give a Witness
How do you help your Bible students from the beginning of their studies to understand the importance of speaking to others about what they are learning?
SUGGESTION: Some pioneers give their Bible students tracts to share with friends and relatives. Others practice informal witnessing with their students.—bh p. 177 par. 9.
If your student expresses a desire to share in the preaching work, how do you help him to see what changes he needs to make before he can do so? (Ps. 24:3-6; 50:16; Rom. 2:21-24; bh p. 154 par. 2; pp. 177-178 pars. 10-11)
Why would it be good to encourage your student to sign up for student assignments on the midweek meeting?
What are the qualifications to sign up for student assignments? (be p. 282 par. 6)
When you believe that a student is qualified to share in field service, what steps should you take in order for him to be approved? (w96 1/15 p. 16; km 2/02 p. 5)
What is involved in preparing your student for his first day in field service? (lv p. 57 par. 14; km 6/96 p. 5 par. 19)
Why are special campaigns useful in training new publishers?
Why is it vital to give our Bible students ongoing training in the witnessing work? Why is it vital to train them in various avenues of service?
Discuss the following steps by which you can help a new publisher develop witnessing skills. (Judg. 7:17; w96 1/15 p. 16 par. 8; km 6/05 p. 1; km 7/05 p. 1; km 8/05 p. 1)
• Providing a brief explanation and showing the student where he can find suggested presentations
• Demonstrating how various features of the ministry are done
• Allowing him to try what you have demonstrated
• Giving heartfelt commendation and reassurance
How would you stress to your student the importance of regular participation in the ministry? (km 8/94 pp. 3-4)
Assisting Students to Dedication and Baptism
How can a consideration of the following steps help us in gauging the progress of a Bible student? What can be done if we determine that the student is at a standstill when it comes to one or more of these steps?
• An interested person starts by “coming to know” Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ (John 17:3)
• His faith increases as his knowledge grows (John 3:16)
• He regularly calls on Jehovah in prayer (Acts 2:21)
• He appreciates the need to associate regularly with others of like faith (Heb. 10:24, 25)
• He repents of his sins (Acts 17:30)
• He turns around, rejecting bad practices (Acts 3:19)
• His faith moves him to speak publicly to others (2 Cor. 4:13)
• He dedicates himself to Jehovah in order to follow Jesus properly (1 Pet. 4:2)
• He symbolizes his dedication by water baptism (Matt 16:24; 1 Pet. 3:21)
Before a student makes a dedication to Jehovah God, how should he feel about Jehovah and His people? (Ps. 40:8; 104:33; Zech. 8:23)
How do you progressively help the student to develop these feelings? (jl Lessons 1, 2, 5, 6; km 9/05 p. 3)
How can you discern the progress a student is making toward having a proper view of his own position in relation to God? (w05 2/1 pp. 28-31)
Why is it vital that your student understand what dedication really means? How does one make a dedication to Jehovah? (w10 1/15 pp. 3-7)
How can you help your student to reflect on his true motivations for getting baptized, and why is this so important? (Matt. 24:13; 28:19, 20)
Press On to Maturity
In what way does our Christian obligation as pioneers extend far beyond a student’s baptism? (Acts 14:22; Gal. 6:10; 1 Pet. 4:10)
For how long and in what ways should you continue helping newly baptized ones? (Col. 2:6, 7; km 3/09 p. 2; km 6/00 p. 4 pars. 7-8)
◆ It is best to continue studying with a progressive Bible student until he has completed two publications—What Does the Bible Really Teach? and “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” This is true even if the student gets baptized before finishing both books. After his baptism, we may continue to report the time, the return visits, and the Bible study. If a publisher accompanies us and participates in the study, he may also count the time.—km 4/11 p. 2.

During their development, have your students been encouraged to . . .
• make decisions based on Bible principles?
• have a regular routine for prayer, personal study, and meditation?
• get along with others at the Kingdom Hall and work for peace? (Matt. 5:23, 24; 18:21, 22; Rom. 12:18)
• support their local Kingdom Hall financially as well as when cleaning and maintenance are needed?
• set such goals in their ministry as: working with the circuit overseer or his wife, auxiliary pioneering, conducting their own Bible studies, being regular in the ministry even during times of hardship?
Why is it important for new ones to have a good foundation in Christian living before we feel our assignment as a teacher is complete? (Col. 2:6, 7; 2 Tim. 3:12; 1 Pet. 5:8, 9)

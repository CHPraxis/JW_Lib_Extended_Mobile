UNIT 7 (A)
Benefit From Counsel and Direction



OPENING DISCUSSION

Jesus has given a precious gift to his congregation on earth. “When he ascended on high he carried away captives; he gave gifts in men.” (Eph. 4:8) These “gifts in men” are overseers, or elders, appointed by Jehovah and his Son to shepherd the congregation with tenderness. (Gal. 6:1) In this time of the end, with the number of anointed overseers dwindling, the vast majority of Christian elders are of the other sheep. (John 10:16) Since they are appointed by holy spirit, these elders too are in the right hand, or under the direction, of the Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ. (Acts 20:28; Rev. 1:16, 20) These godly men submit to Christ, the Head of all the congregations, and thus deserve your full cooperation.
Ephesians 4:11-13 enumerates ways that God’s people are assisted by these precious overseers. Can pioneers work along with the elders to build up the congregation? Can pioneers set the example in their willingness to be readjusted and unified? (w99 6/1 pp. 9-14) How may we “show respect” for the elders and their counsel and direction?—1 Thess. 5:12, 13.



QUESTION OUTLINE

Development of the Christian Congregation
To whom did Jesus delegate oversight of the congregation? (Matt. 10:1; John 21:1, 2, 15-17; Acts 2:41, 42; w13 7/15 p. 16 pars. 7-8)
What does Jesus’ illustration of the wheat and the weeds indicate regarding the congregation? (Matt. 13:24-30; w13 7/15 pp. 18-19 pars. 13-14 and endnote)
How would you answer the question, “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave?” (Matt. 24:45-47; w13 7/15 pp. 21-23)
How do you personally view information published by the faithful slave? (Isa. 54:13)
Working Submissively With “Gifts in Men”
What four outstanding reasons are given at Hebrews 13:7, 17 for pioneers to be obedient and submissive to Christian overseers? (w07 4/1 pp. 28-30 pars. 10-14)
Why were “gifts in men” given to the congregation? (Eph. 4:11-14)
How does Jesus guide Christians by means of faithful undershepherds? (1 Cor. 16:15-18; 2 Tim. 2:2; Tit. 1:5)
How might pioneers receive counsel and direction from the faithful slave through . . .
• Branch Committees?
• traveling overseers?
• congregation elders?
How do we demonstrate submission to those appointed to shepherd the congregation? (1 Thess. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17)
Christian Shepherds Keep Watch Over You
How do loving shepherds protect and keep watch over the flock? (Gal. 6:1; Heb. 13:17a; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3)
Have you seen evidence of this in your congregation? Relate how elders have extended themselves to be of assistance to you or your family members.
◆ The Greek word translated “keeping watch” literally means “abstaining from sleep.” According to one Bible scholar, it “implies the unflagging vigilance of the shepherd.” Since elders may even lose sleep out of concern for our spiritual well-being, should we not cooperate with such loving undershepherds, who strive to imitate the tender care given by Jesus Christ?—w07 4/1 p. 28 par. 12.

Shepherds Serve With Joy
To whom and in what ways are overseers accountable? (Ezek. 34:22-24)
How should appointed overseers treat Jehovah’s flock? (Acts 20:28, 29)
Why are all of us answerable to Jehovah for the way we respond to his direction? (Rom. 14:10-12)
How does our obedience to the appointed elders and cooperation with the direction received from the faithful slave give evidence of our submission to Christ, the Head of the congregation? (Col. 2:19)
◆ Elders have weighty responsibilities of teaching, shepherding, taking the lead in the preaching work, raising their families, and handling problems in the congregation.

Why do we all need counsel and discipline? (Jas. 3:2)
How might our reaction to counsel from a loving shepherd diminish his joy? (Heb. 13:17b)
How can Proverbs 19:20 help us when we receive personal counsel?
How did King Saul react to counsel, and with what result? (1 Sam. 15:20, 24-28)
◆ When someone brings a specific failing to our attention, we might tend to justify ourselves, minimize the problem, question the motive of the counselor, or object to the way the counsel was given. (2 Ki. 5:11) In contrast, if we respond favorably, we will become even more desirable in God’s sight.

How can you show that you desire to work closely with the elders and to set a good example for others? (Phil. 2:20-22)

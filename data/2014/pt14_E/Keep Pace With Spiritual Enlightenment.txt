UNIT 3 (A)
Keep Pace With Spiritual Enlightenment



OPENING DISCUSSION

Jesus taught his disciples many truths that were new to them. However, they still had much to learn. For example, there were questions about the new covenant that had gone into effect at Pentecost 33 C.E. Was the new covenant limited to Jews and Jewish proselytes? Could those uncircumcised also be accepted into this covenant and be anointed with holy spirit? (Acts 10:45) Holy spirit was needed to search into these doctrinal issues. (Luke 12:12) Indeed, Jesus had indicated that such deep spiritual truths as these would be revealed progressively.—John 16:12, 13.
Jehovah God continues to shed light on his people today. This illuminates our path and refines us doctrinally, morally, and organizationally. (Prov. 4:18) As we personally make a search into “the deep things of God,” are we keeping pace with such refinements? How can we continue to build appreciation for “the things that God has prepared for those who love him”? (1 Cor. 2:9, 10) Let us see.

EXPERIENCE: One longtime elder admits: “Accepting a change when it comes and adapting to it can be difficult.” What has helped him accept the many refinements he has witnessed in the 48 years that he has been a Kingdom proclaimer? He answers: “Having the right attitude is the key. Refusing to accept a refinement means being left behind as the organization moves ahead. If I find myself in a situation where changes seem hard to accept, I reflect on Peter’s words to Jesus: ‘Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life.’ Then I ask myself, ‘Where shall I go away to—out there into the darkness of the world?’ This helps me to hold firmly to God’s organization.”—John 6:68.

(<a class="xt" data-xtid="137" href="jwpub://p/E:1102001099/23-23"><em>be </em>p. 189 par. 3</a>) It involves how we listen and what we say. It is manifested by the kindness and consideration that we extend to others as well as our demeanor, our attitude, and even our facial expressions. If we truly care about others, this heartfelt concern will show.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Could you be more alert to show personal interest in others? Successful pioneers genuinely care about others and are observant of their needs. People in every part of the earth respond to a warm smile, a listening ear, sincere concern, and acts of kindness, both small and large.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So be vigilant to display personal interest in others and attract them to the good news. Members of our family and congregation also need our love and attention. You can be sure that Jehovah will richly reward your efforts.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5">EXPERIENCE: In an open letter published in the newspaper <em>Le Progrès, </em>of Saint-Étienne, France, a woman described the visit of two people who knocked on her door shortly after she suffered the tragic loss of her three-month-old daughter in death. “I immediately recognized them as Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she wrote. “I was ready to dismiss them politely, but then I noticed a brochure they were offering. It was about why God permits suffering. So I decided to invite them in with the intention of demolishing their arguments. . . . The Witnesses stayed a little over an hour. They <span id="page38" class="pageNum" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>listened to me with great compassion, and when they were leaving, I felt so much better that I agreed to another visit.” In time, this woman accepted a Bible study. It is revealing that what she remembered about that first visit was, not what the Witnesses said, but how they listened.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5">✍ Keep written records: Your records should be accurate and complete. Write down the name and address of the householder as soon as you leave the call. Do not guess at the house number or the street name<wbr />—check the information to be sure that it is accurate. Write a brief description of the individual. Make note of the topic you discussed, the scriptures you read, any literature you left, and the question you will answer when you return. Include the day and time of the initial call and when you said you would call back. Now that your record is complete, don’t lose it! Keep thinking about the individual and how you will handle the call the next time.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="145" href="jwpub://p/E:202014042/1-12"><em>km </em>2/14 p. 1</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The most important reason for showing sincere interest in others is that by doing so, we imitate the love <span id="page40" class="pageNum" data-no="40" data-before-text="40"></span>and mercy of our heavenly Father. This helps to draw our listeners to Jehovah and to the message he has given us to spread. As you share the good news, strive to “look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p>

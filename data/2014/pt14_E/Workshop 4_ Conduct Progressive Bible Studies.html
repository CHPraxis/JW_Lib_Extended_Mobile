<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Worldwide, millions of Bible studies are being conducted by God’s people each month. Is our interest merely to improve people’s lives or is our commission much more involved? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a> gives clear direction as to our goal. What joy we have when, over time, individuals build a relationship with Jehovah, make changes, and become true footstep followers of Jesus Christ!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this final workshop, we will explore our role, as well as the role of the congregation, in the progress of our Bible students. The Bible likens the work of making a Christian disciple to building a structure upon Jesus Christ as the foundation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:10-46:3:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3 John 4</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="316" href="jwpub://p/E:1102001125/33-36"><em>be </em>p. 278 pars. 1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page127" class="pageNum" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>We encourage you once again to take full advantage of the workshop session. Determine where you can grow as a teacher. Take special note of ways to direct your students to God’s organization. May many more come to know and serve Jehovah and actually be ‘saved through an accurate knowledge of truth.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>.</p>

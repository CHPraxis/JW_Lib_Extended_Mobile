UNIT 6 (A)
Women Who Make Jehovah’s Heart Rejoice



OPENING DISCUSSION

Fear of God impelled two women to defy a Pharaoh. Faith moved a prostitute to risk her life in order to protect two Israelite spies. Sensibleness and humility in a crisis helped a woman to save many lives and to prevent the anointed of Jehovah from incurring bloodguilt. These are just some of the many Scriptural examples of women who made Jehovah’s heart rejoice.—Rom. 16:12; w03 11/1 pp. 8-13.
Jehovah’s attitude toward such women and the blessings he bestowed upon them demonstrate that what pleases him above all else is spirituality, which transcends gender. In today’s world, obsessed as it is with the physical, giving priority to one’s spirituality is a challenge. But that challenge can be met. This is being demonstrated by millions of God-fearing women among God’s people today.
In many lands, there are more women than men proclaiming the Kingdom message, and multitudes more are responding to the good news. (Ps. 68:11) These Christian women imitate the faith, discretion, hospitality, and other fine qualities demonstrated by God-fearing women mentioned in the Bible. (Luke 1:46-49; Acts 16:14, 15; Rom. 15:4) It is important for all of us to understand and to appreciate fully the role of women in the Christian congregation.



QUESTION OUTLINE

A Favored Position of Dignity and Respect
Though created as a helper to man, why are women not inferior creatures? (Gen. 2:18, 23; w95 7/15 pp. 10-11 pars. 4-6)
How do statements at Galatians 3:26-28; 4:26, and Revelation 12:1; 19:7, indicate that Jehovah dignifies the position of women in his arrangement? (it-2 p. 1196 par. 6)
How did Jesus show respect for the dignity of women? (w12 9/1 pp. 8-11)
◆ Jesus took time to teach women. He used respectful and kind expressions when addressing women. Jesus chose to have women bear witness to his resurrection.—Matt. 28:1, 8-10; Luke 10:38-42; 13:10-16.

How is the prophecy at Psalm 68:11 being fulfilled today?
Regarding the honorable relationship between man and woman as established in the beginning, what do you learn from Genesis 2:20-24?
How does Ephesians 5:28-31 show that God’s view of the husband-and-wife relationship has not changed?

What can a wife do to make herself “a crown to her husband”? (Prov. 12:4)
An Orderly Arrangement
Explain how the headship arrangement originated and for what reason? (1 Cor. 11:3; 14:40)
How did Jesus feel about submitting to Jehovah’s headship? (John 5:30; 8:38, 39; Phil. 2:5-8)
How does Galatians 3:26-28 show that the headship arrangement does not stem from some bias on the part of God? Why is the assigning of headship to men not demeaning to women?
Why does wifely subjection not bring hardship on a woman in the Christian household? (Rom. 12:10)
What is the meaning of Paul’s words found at 1 Corinthians 14:33-35? (1 Tim. 2:12; w12 9/1 p. 9 box; g 7/10 p. 29 pars. 2-4)
EXPERIENCE: A husband who formerly treated his Christian wife badly said: “She was very respectful of me. She never once put me down. She didn’t try to force her beliefs on me. She cared for me in a loving way. When she went to an assembly, she worked hard to prepare my meals ahead of time and to get the housework done. Her attitude started to arouse my interest in the Bible. And, well, here I am!” Yes, he had, in effect, been “won without a word” by his wife’s conduct.
What good may result when the Christian woman is in subjection to an unbelieving husband? (1 Pet. 3:1, 2)
Even when there is no favorable outcome, why can a wife find satisfaction in showing respect for headship? (Col. 3:18, 23)
What headship is the Christian woman to recognize besides the headship of her husband? (1 Cor. 14:35; 1 Tim. 2:11-14)
How would a woman show that she recognizes the headship principle when caring for matters pertaining to worship that would ordinarily be handled by her husband or by a baptized brother? (1 Cor. 11:4, 5)
Read 1 Corinthians 11:2-16.
Explain why a Christian woman would or would not need to wear a head covering in the following situations.
• She prays in behalf of herself and her unbaptized children in the presence of her unbelieving husband.
Needed because the husband is present. (w02 7/15 p. 26 par. 2; lv p. 209 par. 3)
• She conducts a Bible study with her baptized son while her husband is absent.
Needed because the son is baptized and should be taught by baptized males. (w02 7/15 p. 27 par. 1; lv p. 209 par. 3)
• She conducts a meeting for field service arranged by the congregation.
Needed because the meeting is a congregation arrangement. (w02 7/15 p. 27 par. 2; lv p. 210 par. 1)
• She orally interprets a Bible discourse or publicly reads paragraphs from a Bible study aid used at a congregation meeting.
Not needed since she is not presiding. (w02 7/15 p. 27 par. 3)
• She interprets Bible discourses into sign language at Christian meetings, assemblies, or conventions.
It would be appropriate in view of the interpreter’s magnified role. (w09 11/15 pp. 12-13)
• She interprets into sign language the midweek meeting, the Watchtower Study, and Kingdom songs.
“It may be more practical to wear a head covering during the entire meeting.” (w09 11/15 p. 13)
• She is accompanied by a baptized brother while going from house to house and making return visits.
Not needed, since both men and women have the responsibility to preach and teach outsiders. (w02 7/15 p. 27 par. 4; lv p. 210 par. 2)
• She conducts a prearranged Bible study, and a baptized brother is present.
Needed because the baptized brother is present. The baptized brother should offer the prayer. (w02 7/15 p. 27 par. 5; lv p. 210 par. 1)
Why may a sister prefer to wear a head covering under certain circumstances that do not really require her to do so? (1 Tim. 1:5)
◆ Appropriate head coverings for sisters would include a hat, scarf, head veil, and so forth.—w77 2/15 p. 126.

How would you harmonize the principle of subjection to one’s husband with the principle found at Acts 5:29? (ia p. 80 par. 16)

In what vast field of service have women shared effectively? (Acts 2:17, 18; 18:26; g 7/10 pp. 28-29)

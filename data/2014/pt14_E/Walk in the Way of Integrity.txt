UNIT 8 (A)
Walk in the Way of Integrity



OPENING DISCUSSION

When Satan rebelled in the garden of Eden, he raised the universal issue of the rightfulness of God’s sovereignty over all His creatures. At a later time, he challenged that humans would serve God only as long as doing so was to their selfish advantage. (Job 1:9-11; 2:4) Thus, man’s integrity has become an important part of the issue of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty.
While God’s sovereignty is not dependent on the integrity of his creatures, humans and spirit sons of God can demonstrate where they stand on this issue. How? By choosing to follow a course of integrity or not. An individual’s integrity, then, is a solid basis on which he or she can be judged.
Walking in integrity requires loyal attachment to God, even in unfavorable circumstances. When we bear up under trials, remain firm despite adversities, or resist temptations from this ungodly world, our integrity becomes evident. We ‘make Jehovah’s heart rejoice’ in that he is able to make a reply to the one who taunts him. (Prov. 27:11) With good reason then, we can resolve as Job did: “Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity!”—Job 27:5.

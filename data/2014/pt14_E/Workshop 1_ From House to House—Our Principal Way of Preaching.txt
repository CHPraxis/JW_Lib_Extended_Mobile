UNIT 5 (B)
Workshop 1: From House to House—Our Principal Way of Preaching

In this workshop we will consider how to
✔ prepare for the house-to-house ministry
✔ show personal interest and initiate conversations
✔ maintain a positive attitude toward the ministry




OPENING DISCUSSION

Instructions on how to fulfill our ministry have their basis in Scripture. For example, Jesus gave clear instructions to his followers on how to carry out the preaching work, and this proved to be a real blessing to them after his death.—Luke 10:1-12.
The Bible says of Jesus’ followers: “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.” (Acts 5:42) The apostle Paul also zealously taught from house to house. (Acts 20:20) This method of spreading the good news remains our principal way of preaching.
In this workshop, the instructor will briefly review some of the key lessons of the preceding two units and will focus attention on the practical application of these lessons.
During each workshop period, observe the teaching methods used. Participate fully, and use the opportunity to recognize your own strengths and weaknesses. Listen carefully to the observations of the instructors as well as the expressions of your fellow students. Be receptive to any new suggestions and ideas that are presented. Doing so will help you to have greater confidence and to be more effective in this vital aspect of our ministry.—km 2/09 p. 2.
In preparation for this unit, please review some current issues of Our Kingdom Ministry and be prepared to highlight introductions that work well in your territory.

From House to House—Our Principal Way of Preaching



OPENING DISCUSSION

The method of preaching from house to house is well-founded in the Bible. When Jesus sent forth the apostles to preach, he instructed them: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (Matt. 10:11) How were they to search for deserving ones? Jesus continued: “When you enter the house, greet the household. If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it.” (Matt. 10:12, 13) Were they to visit without a prior invitation? Note Jesus’ further words: “Wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words, on going out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.” (Matt. 10:14) These instructions make clear that as the apostles “went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news,” they were to take the initiative to visit people in their homes.—Luke 9:6; bt p. 41 par. 16.

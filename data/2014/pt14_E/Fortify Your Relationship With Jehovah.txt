UNIT 1 (B)
Fortify Your Relationship With Jehovah



OPENING DISCUSSION

Nothing in life is more important than our relationship with Jehovah. King David, expressing appreciation for his close friendship with God, said: “Because your loyal love is better than life, my own lips will glorify you.” (Ps. 63:3) What did David mean by saying that God’s loyal love was “better than life?” David appreciated that intimacy with the Giver of life is what makes living truly meaningful.
Is that how you feel? Think back to the moment you first came to understand God’s love. What effect did it have on your life? Do you remember the first time you realized that life does have a purpose? How grateful you were to Jehovah! The apostle John wrote: “We love, because he first loved us.” (1 John 4:19) Your deep love for Jehovah motivated you to make a dedication to him and symbolize it by water immersion. You realize that nothing has been more satisfying than ‘glorifying God with your own lips.’
The love of God in our heart can be likened to a living thing. Like a beautiful plant, love needs to be nourished and cared for if it is to grow and to thrive. When neglected or deprived of nourishment, love weakens and dies. Our Exemplar, Jesus, did not take his love for Jehovah for granted. He kept it strong throughout his earthly sojourn. (cf p. 132 par. 11) How can we continue to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah?

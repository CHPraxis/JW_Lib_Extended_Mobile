<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>God’s Word tells us: “Honor your father and your mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 20:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:2-49:6:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:2</a>) Jesus showed that this commandment is very important when he condemned the Pharisees and scribes who refused to care for their parents.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In his letter to Timothy, the apostle Paul wrote that Christians should take care of their own families. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:4-54:5:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 5:4,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <strong>8,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:16-54:5:16" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> <strong>16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He mentioned this principle while discussing who could receive financial support from the congregation. Paul said that Christian children, grandchildren, and other relatives had the main responsibility to care for elderly widows. By doing this, there would be no unnecessary expense for the congregation. Today, too, we prove that we love God by making sure that our relatives have what they need.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why does the Bible not give specific instructions about caring for elderly parents?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Adult children should make sure that their parents are well cared for. Paul was talking about helping “believing” relatives, but parents who are not members of the Christian congregation should also not be neglected. Family situations are not all the same, so each family must make its own decisions about how care is provided. Each person’s health, needs, and personality is different. Some older ones have many children, but others have just one child. Some can get support from the government; others cannot. Also, those needing care have different preferences. It would not be wise or loving to criticize the choices of our brothers who are trying their best to care for aged relatives. Jehovah can bless any decision that is based on the Bible. He can make our decisions work, just as he has done for his people since ancient times.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:11:23-4:11:23" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Numbers 11:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Those in the full-time service who have assignments far from home may have to make very difficult decisions. Bethelites, missionaries, and traveling overseers feel that their assignment is a precious blessing from Jehovah. Still, if their parents get sick, their first reaction might be, ‘We need to leave our assignment and return home to take care of our parents.’ However, it is wise to pray and think about what parents really need or want. No one should be quick to <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>give up an assignment from Jehovah, and it may not always be necessary. Could the health problem be temporary?

The missionary couple were seriously thinking about leaving their assignment to take care of their parents. Then they received a telephone call from the elders in the parents’ congregation. The elders had discussed the situation and wanted the missionaries to stay in their assignment as long as possible.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>13, 14. </strong>How does the Bible show that congregations should help care for elderly members?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Not all can help full-time servants as did the congregation mentioned above. But the Bible shows that congregations should do everything <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>they can to help faithful older ones. In the Jerusalem congregation in the first century, “no one was in need among them.” This does not mean that all were rich. It actually seems that some had very little, but “distribution would be made to each one according to his need.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:34-44:4:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 4:34, 35</a>) Later, though, there was a serious problem in that congregation. Some widows were not receiving “the daily distribution” of food. So, what did the apostles do? They assigned responsible men to make sure that the widows were treated fairly and given enough food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:1-44:6:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 6:1-5</a>) This was necessary because at the time of Pentecost in the year 33, many foreign visitors became Christians and stayed in Jerusalem to strengthen their faith. So even though the distribution of food was just temporary, the apostles’ decision shows that congregations can help care for the needs of faithful older brothers and sisters.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Paul explained to Timothy when it would be appropriate for the congregation to help Christian widows with their material needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:3-54:5:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:3-16</a>) James was inspired to write that Christians have the responsibility to care for orphans, widows, and others who suffer hard times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="22-1" class="b">James 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:15-59:2:17" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2:15-17</a>) The apostle John too explained: “Whoever has the material possessions of this world and sees his brother in need and yet refuses to show him compassion, in what way does the love of God remain in him?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:17-62:3:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 3:17</a>) So if individual Christians have the responsibility to care for those in need, then congregations have this responsibility too.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>In some countries, the government may help the elderly by providing pensions and other programs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:13:6-45:13:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 13:6</a>) In other places, such programs are not available. So how much care relatives and congregations need to give will depend on the situation. If believing children live far from their parents, it may affect how much the children can do. The children need to communicate with the elders of their parents’ congregation to make sure that all understand the family’s circumstances. For example, the elders may be able to help the parents find out what assistance the government can give to older ones. They may also notice things that the children need to know about, such as important letters that have not been opened or medicine that the parents have not taken. If the children and the elders communicate openly and clearly, they may be able to find solutions. When there is someone nearby to help or give advice to family members who live far away, this can prevent a situation from getting worse, and the family may worry less.</p>

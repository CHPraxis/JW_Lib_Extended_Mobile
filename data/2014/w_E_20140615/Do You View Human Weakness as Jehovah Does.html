<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">WE ALL feel weak at times. A bout of flu or allergies may weaken us to the point that we find it difficult to cope with our daily activities.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul knew what it was like to be affected, even weakened, by pressures from outside the congregation and from within it. More than once, he thought that he had reached his limit.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What might influence our view of those who need assistance in the congregation?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We are living in a competitive world where strength and youth are frequently exalted. Many do whatever it takes to get their way, often trampling on the feelings of those who are weaker. We do not condone such behavior, yet we may unconsciously develop a negative view of those who regularly need assistance, even in the congregation. But we can develop a more balanced view, one like God’s.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>(a) How does the illustration found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:21-46:12:23" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:21-23</a> help us to grasp Jehovah’s view of human weakness? (b) How can we benefit from helping the weak?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We can gain insight into the way Jehovah views human weakness from an illustration recorded in Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians. In chapter 12, Paul reminds us that even the least attractive or the weakest part of the human body has a function. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:12-46:12:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 12:12,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:18-46:12:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <strong>18,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:21-46:12:23" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> <strong>21-23</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Aspects of this concept of the human body have been challenged by some evolutionists. Nevertheless, findings in the study of anatomy show that body parts once considered useless actually do perform essential functions.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> For example, some have questioned the usefulness of the little toe; however, it is now recognized to have an impact on the balance of the whole body.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Paul’s illustration highlights that all members of the Christian congregation are useful. Unlike Satan, who strips humans of their dignity, Jehovah views all of his servants, including those who seem to be weaker, as “necessary.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:4:18-18:4:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19</a>) That thought should help each of us to feel good about our role in the local congregation and about being part of the congregation of God’s people earth wide. Think of a time, for example, when you held out your arm to an elderly person who was in need of help. You may have had to adjust your pace. Did not providing assistance serve a useful purpose as well as make you feel good? Yes, when we respond to the needs of others, we experience the joy of caring for them, and we grow in patience, love, and maturity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:15-49:4:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:15, 16</a>) Our loving Father knows that a congregation that values all members, regardless of their limitations, reflects balance and love.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How did Paul at times use the words “weak” and “strong”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Interestingly, in writing to the Corinthians, Paul used the words “weak” and “weakness” in reference to the way unbelievers perceived first-century Christians and also to the way he felt about himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:26-46:1:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:3-46:2:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) When Paul spoke of those who were “strong,” he did not intend to make some Christians feel superior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:1-45:15:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 15:1</a>) Rather, he was saying that Christians with more experience should be patient with those who were not yet firmly rooted in the truth.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When we assist “the lowly one,” not only do we imitate Jehovah but we also gain his approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:41:1-19:41:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:1</a>) Admittedly, though, a negative view of those in need may at times hold us back from assisting them.

Cynthia,<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> a sister whose husband abandoned her, comments: “If brothers avoid you or do not act the way you would expect close friends to act, it can hurt. When you are going through trials, you need people around you.” David of old knew the feeling of being avoided.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:31:12-19:31:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 31:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>We will likely be more empathetic if we remember that some of our dear brothers and sisters have been weakened by adverse circumstances<wbr />—suffering from poor health, living in a divided household, or coping with depression. We might find ourselves in a similar situation one day. Before entering the Promised Land, the Israelites, who had been poor and weak in the land of Egypt, were reminded that they should not “harden [their] heart” toward their afflicted brothers. Jehovah expected them to consider the poor as being worthy of help.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:15:7-5:15:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 15:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:15:11-5:15:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:25:35-3:25:38" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Lev. 25:35-38</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Rather than being judgmental or suspicious, we should provide spiritual comfort to those facing undesirable circumstances.

No, they immediately provide the needed medical assistance. Similarly, if a fellow believer has been weakened by personal problems, our priority should be to provide spiritual assistance.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How might some who may appear to be weaker really be “rich in faith”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>If we pause to reflect on our brothers’ circumstances, we may see their seeming frailty in a different light. Think of sisters who have been enduring family opposition for years. Some may be of humble appearance and look fragile, yet do they not demonstrate outstanding faith and inner strength? When you see a single mother regularly coming to meetings with her child or children, are you not impressed by her faith and determination? And what of teenagers who stick to the truth despite the bad influences in school? In all modesty, we recognize that such ones, who may seem to be weaker, may be as “rich in faith” as those among us who have more favorable circumstances.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:5-59:2:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>.</p>

But He discerned that Aaron was not a bad person or gravely at fault. It seems that Aaron allowed circumstances or the influence of others to turn him away from the right course.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In order to adjust our thinking to Jehovah’s, we should analyze our view of those who seem to be weak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:7</a>) For example, how do we react when a teenager does not exercise discretion in his choice of entertainment or when he displays a careless attitude?

Elijah was one of them. Although he had fearlessly challenged 450 prophets of Baal, Elijah ran away from Queen Jezebel when he learned that she was plotting to kill him. After walking some 95 miles (150 km) to Beer-sheba, he went deep into the wilderness.

They did not leave us alone for the first two or three days. Because we were not eating properly and were very emotional, for a time they took us under their roof.” That likely brings to your mind what James wrote: “If a brother or a sister is lacking clothing and enough food for the day, yet one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,’ but you do not give them what they need for their body, of what benefit is it?

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S Son, Jesus Christ, declared: “I love the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:31-43:14:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:31</a>) Jesus also said: “The Father has affection for the Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:20-43:5:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 5:20</a>) That should not surprise us. After all, for ages during Jesus’ prehuman existence, he was God’s “master worker.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 8:30</a>) As Jehovah and Jesus worked together, the Son learned much about his Father’s qualities and had innumerable reasons to love him. In fact, close association evidently caused their mutual love to grow.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What does love involve? (b) We will discuss what questions?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Love involves a feeling of deep affection for someone. The psalmist David sang: “I have affection for you, O Jehovah, my strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:18:1-19:18:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 18:1</a>) That is how we should feel about God, for he has affection for us. If we obey Jehovah, he will show his love for us. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:12-5:7:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 7:12, 13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But can we really love God, since we cannot see him? What does it mean to love Jehovah? Why should we love him? And how can we show our love for God?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>Why is it possible for us to love Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>“God is a Spirit”; hence, we cannot see him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) Yet, love for Jehovah is possible, and we are commanded in the Scriptures to express that love. For example, Moses told the Israelites: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Why can we have deep love for God? Because he created us with a spiritual need and endowed us with the ability to express love. When our spiritual need is properly satisfied, our love for Jehovah grows and we have a sound basis for happiness. “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need,” said Jesus, “since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) Concerning what some call humans’ innate desire to worship, it has been said: “We should stand in awe, amazement and reverence to see the universality of man’s search for, and belief in, a supreme being.”<wbr />—<em>Man Does Not Stand Alone, </em>by A. C. Morrison.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How do we know that it is not futile to search for God?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Is it futile to search for God? No, for he wants us to find him. The apostle Paul made that clear when he gave a witness to a group assembled on the Areopagus. That took place within sight of the Parthenon<wbr />—a temple dedicated to Athena, the patron goddess of ancient Athens. Imagine that you are there as Paul speaks about “the God who made the world and all the things in it” and then explains that He “does not dwell in handmade temples.” The apostle adds that God “made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of where men would dwell, so that they would seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:24-44:17:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-27</a>) Yes, people can find God. Over seven and a half million Witnesses of Jehovah ‘really have found him’<wbr />—and they truly love him.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Our love for Jehovah should spring from the heart. Jesus made that clear when a Pharisee asked: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:34-40:22:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 22:34-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What does it mean to love God with (a) our “whole heart”? (b) our “whole soul”? (c) our “whole mind”?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What did Jesus mean when he said that we must love God with our “whole heart”? He meant that we must love Jehovah with our entire figurative heart, affecting our desires, emotions, and feelings. We must also love him with our “whole soul,” or our life and being. Moreover, we must love God with our “whole mind,” or our full intellect. In essence, we ought to love Jehovah fully, without reservation.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Loving God fully will move us to do what?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>If we love God with our whole heart, soul, and mind, we will be diligent students of his Word, will wholeheartedly serve his purposes, and will zealously declare the good news of the Kingdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 4:8</a>) Of course, we cannot possibly list all the reasons why we should love <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>God.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why do you love Jehovah as our Creator and our Provider?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Jehovah is our Creator and our Provider. </strong>“By him we have life and move and exist,” said Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 17:28</a>) Jehovah has given us our splendid earthly home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 115:16</a>) He also provides food and other things we need in order to sustain our life. Therefore, Paul could tell the idolatrous residents of Lystra that “the living God . . . did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:15-44:14:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 14:15-17</a>) Is that not reason to love our Grand Creator and loving Provider?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How should we react to God’s provision for the removal of sin and death?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>God has made possible the removal of the sin and death we inherited from Adam. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Indeed, “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 5:8</a>) Undoubtedly, our heart overflows with love for Jehovah because he has made it possible for us to receive forgiveness of our sins if we are repentant and exercise faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>In what ways has Jehovah given us hope?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Jehovah ‘gives hope that fills us with joy and peace.’ </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 15:13</a>) God-given hope enables us to endure tests of faith.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>) What is our natural response to such prospects?

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup>Diligently study and apply God’s Word. </strong>Doing so shows that we love Jehovah and truly want his word to be a ‘light for our path.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) If we are experiencing distress, we can draw comfort from such loving assurances as these: “A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.” “Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me. When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:17-19:51:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 51:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:94:18-19:94:19" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 94:18, 19</a>) Jehovah shows mercy to those who suffer, and Jesus similarly feels pity for people.

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>If you have a loving relationship with Jehovah, you will be a ‘doer of the word, not a hearer only.’ <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="52-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:22-25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>A “doer” has faith that produces such works as zealous preaching activity and participation in Christian meetings. Because you really love God, you will obey Jehovah’s “perfect law,” which covers everything he requires of you.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>21. </strong>To what may your heartfelt prayers be likened?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Love for Jehovah God will cause you to turn to him often in heartfelt prayer. Evidently alluding to the daily burning of incense under the Law covenant, the psalmist David sang: “May my prayer be as incense prepared before you [Jehovah], my uplifted hands like the evening grain offering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:141:2-19:141:2" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 141:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:30:7-2:30:8" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> Ex. 30:7, 8</a>) May your humble petitions, your earnest supplications, and your heartfelt words of praise and thanksgiving to God be like the sweet-smelling incense that symbolizes acceptable prayers.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:8-66:5:8" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Rev. 5:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>22. </strong>What kind of love will we discuss next?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Jesus said that we must love God and also our neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>) As we shall see in our further discussion of this quality, our love for Jehovah and his principles will help us to interact well with fellow humans and display love for our neighbor.</p>

DO YOU REMEMBER?




Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
At what time was the Passover lamb to be slaughtered on Nisan 14?
Some Bible translations say that it was to be slaughtered “between the two evenings,” meaning at twilight or at dusk—after sunset but before full darkness. (Ex. 12:6)—12/15, pages 18-19.
Youths can use what Bible principles to make wise choices?
Three are (1) Seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness. (Matt. 6:19-34) (2) Find happiness in serving others. (Acts 20:35) (3) Enjoy serving God in your youth. (Eccl. 12:1)—1/15, pages 19-20.
What four horsemen have been on the move since 1914?
Jesus, as a rider on a white horse, has acted to rid the heavens of Satan and his demons. The rider on a fiery-colored horse depicts the wars that have afflicted mankind. The rider on a black horse represents famine. The rider of the pale horse brings death by plague, striking down millions. (Rev. 6:2-8)—2/1, pages 6-7.
When does “the marriage of the Lamb” take place? (Rev. 19:7)
“The marriage of the Lamb” takes place after the King, Jesus Christ, completes his conquest, that is, after Babylon the Great has been destroyed and the war of Armageddon has been fought.—2/15, page 10.
Why were the Jews in Jesus’ day “in expectation” of the Messiah? (Luke 3:15)
We cannot confirm that first-century Jews understood Daniel’s prophecy about the Messiah as we do. (Dan. 9:24-27) Still, they might have heard of the angelic announcement to some shepherds or what the prophetess Anna said upon seeing the babe Jesus at the temple. Also, astrologers came looking for “the one born king of the Jews.” (Matt. 2:1, 2) Later, John the Baptizer indicated that the Christ would soon appear.—2/15, pages 26-27.
How can we avoid letting our Yes be No? (2 Cor. 1:18)
Admittedly, something beyond our control may occasionally make it impossible for us to keep our word. But if we make a promise or a commitment, we should do all we can to keep it.—3/15, page 32.
How can we resist the temptation to look at pornography?
Three helpful steps are (1) Quickly averting our view if we are exposed to erotic imagery. (2) Guarding our thoughts by focusing on positive things and praying to God. (3) Guarding our step by avoiding films or Web sites that contain pornography.—4/1, pages 10-12.
What unintended consequences may there be if a Christian leaves his or her family behind to earn money in another land?
When parents choose not to live together as a family, the children may suffer emotionally and morally. They may come to resent the parent(s). And adults living away from their mates may face sexual temptations.—4/15, pages 19-20.
Why were the legs of criminals being executed on a stake broken?
The Romans executed some criminals on a stake. The Jews asked that the legs of the criminals alongside Jesus be broken. That would make it harder for the victims to breathe, hastening death. Thus, they would not need to remain all night on the stake. (Deut. 21:22, 23)—5/1, page 11.
We should keep what four questions in mind when approaching people in our ministry?
Who are they? Where am I approaching them? When am I approaching them? How should I approach them?—5/15, pages 12-15.
How deadly has smoking been?
During the last century, it has killed 100,000,000 people. Currently, it takes about 6,000,000 lives a year.—6/1, page 3.

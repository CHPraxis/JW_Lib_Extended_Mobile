<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>What four horsemen have been on the move since 1914?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">Jesus, as a rider on a white horse, has acted to rid the heavens of Satan and his demons. The rider on a fiery-colored horse depicts the wars that have afflicted mankind. The rider on a black horse represents famine. The rider of the pale horse brings death by plague, striking down millions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:6:2-66:6:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 6:2-8</a>)<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:2014083/24-28">2/1, pages 6-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>Why were the Jews in Jesus’ day “in expectation” of the Messiah? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:15-42:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 3:15</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">We cannot confirm that first-century Jews understood Daniel’s prophecy about the Messiah as we do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24-27</a>) Still, they might have heard of the angelic announcement to some shepherds or what the prophetess Anna said upon seeing the babe Jesus at the temple. Also, astrologers came looking for “the one born king of the Jews.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:1-40:2:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 2:1, 2</a>) Later, John the Baptizer indicated that the Christ would soon appear.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:2014127/1-14">2/15, pages 26-27</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>How can we resist the temptation to look at pornography?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Three helpful steps are (1) Quickly averting our view if we are exposed to erotic imagery.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">The Romans executed some criminals on a stake. The Jews asked that the legs of the criminals alongside Jesus be broken. That would make it harder for the victims to breathe, hastening death. Thus, they would not need to remain all night on the stake.

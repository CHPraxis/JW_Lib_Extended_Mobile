<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We usually think of a neighbor as someone who lives near to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:10-20:27:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:10</a>) But when a man asked Jesus: <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>“Who really is my neighbor?” he answered him using the illustration of the Samaritan and explained what it means to love others. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:29-42:10:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 10:29-37</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>A Jewish man had been robbed, beaten, and left on the road to die. An Israelite priest and a Levite, who were supposed to be good neighbors, saw him but did not help him. Instead, a Samaritan helped him. At that time, most Jews and Samaritans hated one another.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:9-43:4:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The Samaritan poured oil and wine on the injured man’s wounds to help the wounds heal. Then he took him to an inn and gave the innkeeper two denarii. This was equal to the pay that a person would receive for two days of work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:2-40:20:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 20:2</a>) When we think of how much that Samaritan did to help the injured man, we know that he had real love for his neighbor. We can be like that Samaritan if we have compassion and love for people.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup>Follow the Golden Rule. </strong>Jesus told us what the Golden Rule is when he said: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them. This, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>) “The Law” refers to the books of Genesis through Deuteronomy, and “the Prophets” refer to the prophetic books of the Hebrew Scriptures. Jehovah gave “the Law” and “the Prophets” to his people because he loved them and wanted them to love one another. Today, too, Jehovah expects us to love our neighbor. In the book of Isaiah, Jehovah says: “Uphold justice, and do what is righteous . . . Happy is the man who does this.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:56:1-23:56:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 56:1, 2</a>) If we show love for our neighbor and follow the Golden Rule, we will be happy.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>Love your enemies. </strong>Jehovah has always taught us to love our enemies. In Jesus’ time, some taught that people should hate their enemies. But Jesus counseled: “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:43-40:5:45" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 5:43-45</a>) Paul gave similar counsel when he said: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:20-45:12:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 12:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:25:21-20:25:21" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Proverbs 25:21</a>) In ancient Israel, Jehovah gave his people laws instructing them to help their enemies and even their enemies’ animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:5-2:23:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 23:5</a>) By applying that counsel, some people who once hated one another might have become good friends. As Christians, showing love for our enemies may change the way they feel about <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>us. Some of them may even become servants of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What did Jesus say about making peace with our brother?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>“Pursue peace with all people.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:14-58:12:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:14</a>) If we must make peace with all people, of course we must make peace with our brothers. Jesus said: “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away. First make your peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:23-40:5:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 5:23, 24</a>) Whenever we have a problem with one of our brothers, we can show love for him by trying to make peace as soon as we can.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>Do not judge others. </strong>“Stop judging that you may not be judged.” Jesus taught us not to judge others for the mistakes that they make. He also said: “Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the straw from your eye,’ when look! a rafter is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother’s eye.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:1-40:7:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 7:1-5</a>) The lesson is that we should not criticize other people when they make mistakes because we make many mistakes ourselves.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>If we love our neighbor in the way that Paul described, we will please Jehovah, have fewer problems, and be happy.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>“Love is patient and kind.” Jehovah is patient and kind toward all people even though they are imperfect. So we need to be patient and kind when others make mistakes, even if they are unkind or rude to us. The Bible says that “love is not jealous.” Some of our brothers may have privileges in the congregation or other things that we do not have. But if we truly love our brothers, we will not be jealous of them. Also, we should not be proud or boast about ourselves. The Bible tells us that Jehovah hates those who have “haughty eyes and an arrogant heart.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:4-20:21:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Love “does not behave indecently.” If we show love for our neighbor, we will not lie to him or steal from him or do anything else that makes Jehovah unhappy.

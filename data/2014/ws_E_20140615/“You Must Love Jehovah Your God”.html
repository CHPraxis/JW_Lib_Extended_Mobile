<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">JESUS described the close relationship he has with his Father when he said: “I love the Father” and, “the Father has affection for the Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:20-43:5:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:31-43:14:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:31</a>) Before Jesus came to earth, they worked together for many billions of years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30</a>) During this time, Jesus learned much about his Father’s qualities, and their love for each other grew.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What does it mean to love someone? (b) What questions will we discuss?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>When you love someone, you have deep feelings for that person. David sang: “I have affection for you, O Jehovah, my strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:18:1-19:18:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 18:1</a>) That is how we should feel about God. He promises that if we obey him, he will show his love for us. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:12-5:7:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 7:12, 13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But we cannot see God, so how can we love him? What does it mean to love Jehovah? Why should we love him? And how can we prove that we love God?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We cannot see God because “God is a Spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Even so, it is possible to love Jehovah. In fact, the Bible commands us to love him. For example, Moses told the Israelites: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Why is it possible to love God? He created us with the need to worship him, and he also gave us the ability to show love. When we get to know Jehovah, our love for him grows, and this makes us happy. This is what Jesus meant when he said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) In his book <em>Man Does Not Stand Alone, </em>A. C. Morrison said that it is amazing to see that humans have always searched for and have wanted to believe in God. Like the writer, many understand that humans are born with a need to know God.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How do we know that we can find God?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Can we ever find God? Yes, he wants us to have a relationship with him. The apostle Paul made that clear when he spoke to a group in ancient Athens. Many of them felt that they needed to go to a temple to worship the goddess Athena. But Paul said that they could find the true God “who made the world and all the things in it.” He explained that God does not live in temples. People who search for God can find him, no matter where they live on earth. Then he said that God “is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:24-44:17:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-27</a>) Yes, people can find God. Over seven and a half million of Jehovah’s Witnesses have found him, and they truly love him.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How strong should our love for Jehovah be? When a Pharisee, a religious man, asked Jesus: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus clearly said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:34-40:22:38" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 22:34-38</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What did Jesus mean when he said that we must love God with our “whole heart,” “whole soul,” and “whole mind”? Our “whole heart” means our true emotions, desires, and feelings. Our “whole soul” means who we are as a person and includes everything we do in our life. And our “whole mind” means the way we think and what we think about. In this way, Jesus emphasized that we must love Jehovah with all we are and with all we have.</p>

That is why Paul could tell people in Lystra that they should not worship idols but should worship Jehovah, “the living God.” Paul said about God: “He did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:15-44:14:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 14:15-17</a>) Jehovah lovingly gives us everything we need.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>God will remove the sin and death we inherited from Adam. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) The Bible says: “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 5:8</a>) If we are truly repentant and have faith in the ransom sacrifice, God will forgive our sins.

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Jehovah has given us a “perfect law,” which tells us everything he wants us to do. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="51-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:22-25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If you want a strong relationship with Jehovah, you have to do more than just listen to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>) You have to <strong>do </strong>something about what you learn. For example, because you love God, you will make an effort to talk to others about him and to comment at the meetings.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>We pray to Jehovah constantly because we love him. In Israel, the priests would burn incense to Jehovah every day. King David compared his prayers to incense when he sang: “May my prayer be as incense prepared before you [Jehovah], my uplifted hands like the evening grain offering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:141:2-19:141:2" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 141:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:30:7-2:30:8" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Exodus 30:7, 8</a>) Jehovah listened to David’s prayers. If we pray in a humble, sincere, and thankful way, then our prayers will also be like incense and will please Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:8-66:5:8" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Revelation 5:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Jesus said that we must love God, but he also said that we must love our neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-39</a>) When we love Jehovah and his principles, it will help us to love our neighbor. We will learn about what this means in the next article.</p>

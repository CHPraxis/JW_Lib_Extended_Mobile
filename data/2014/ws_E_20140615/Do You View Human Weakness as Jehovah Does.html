<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">WE ALL feel weak at times. Some days when we are not feeling well, we may have no energy and may find it difficult to do what we need to do. But now imagine feeling this way for a long time. How would we want others to treat us? Of course, we would want them to try to understand how we feel, that is, to show empathy toward us.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul sometimes felt weak because of pressures from outside and from inside the congregation.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In the world today, many take advantage of those who are frail and weak in order to get what they want. They believe that to be successful, a person must be young and strong. The world’s attitude could affect us too. We may begin to have a negative view of certain brothers who often need help. How can we view each member of the congregation as Jehovah does?</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah views each member of the congregation as important. In chapter 12 of his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul reminds us that even the weakest part of the human body is needed. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:12-46:12:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 12:12,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:18-46:12:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <strong>18,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:21-46:12:23" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> <strong>21-23</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Some who believe in evolution have said that certain parts of the body are not needed.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) For example, the little toe was once considered useless. But now scientists have discovered that our little toe helps our whole body remain steady when we are standing up.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Paul’s illustration about the human body shows that every member of the congregation is needed. Satan wants us to believe that we are useless. But Jehovah views all of his servants as “necessary,” even those who may <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>seem to be weaker. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:4:18-18:4:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19</a>) This means that we can feel good that we are needed in our congregation and among God’s people worldwide. For example, think of a time when you helped an elderly person. He benefited, but did you also benefit? Yes. When we help others, we are happy, we become more patient, we love our brothers even more, and we become better Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:15-49:4:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>) Jehovah wants us to think of our brothers and sisters as important, even those who seem to be weak. When we have this view, we will not expect too much of our brothers, and the congregation will be more loving.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How did Paul use the words “weak” and “strong”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>It is true that Paul did use the words “weak” and “weakness” when he spoke about some in the congregation. This was because some unbelievers viewed Christians in that way. But Paul was not saying that some Christians were better than others. Also, sometimes he described himself as weak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:26-46:1:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:3-46:2:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) And when he used the word “strong” to describe certain Christians, he was not saying that they were better than others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:1-45:15:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 15:1</a>) He was simply saying that those with more experience should be patient with those with less experience.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">WHEN parents watch their little ones play, they are often amazed by the abilities that their children have. You may have seen this too. One child may be good at playing sports, while another likes drawing or making things. Whatever those abilities are, parents enjoy helping their children to reach their full potential, in other words, to do the very best they can.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>As a loving parent, Jehovah is interested in his servants. They are “precious” to him especially because they are faithful and loyal to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:2:7-37:2:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Haggai 2:7</a>) Yet, you may have noticed that your brothers and sisters also have many different talents and abilities. For example, some brothers are excellent speakers, and others are good organizers. Many sisters are good at learning foreign languages and use them in the ministry. Others are good at caring for the needs of the sick or giving encouragement to those who need it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:16:1-45:16:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:16:12-45:16:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 12</a>) We are deeply grateful to be in the congregation with all such brothers and sisters.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What did Jehovah see in Gideon? What do we learn from Jehovah’s example?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The Bible shows that Jehovah not only sees the good qualities of his servants but also sees their potential. For example, Jehovah chose Gideon to free the Israelites from their enemies the Midianites. Gideon felt unimportant, so he must have been shocked when an angel told him: “Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.” Gideon did not feel “mighty” at all, and he felt unable to save God’s people. But Jehovah saw things differently. He saw what Gideon was capable of and knew that He could use Gideon to save Israel.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:6:11-7:6:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Judges 6:11-16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

</div>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah had full confidence in Gideon because He knew his potential. For example, Jehovah saw that when Gideon beat and prepared wheat, he worked with all his strength. Also, farmers usually worked outside, but Gideon was preparing the wheat inside a winepress so that the Midianites would not see his crop and steal it. Jehovah saw that Gideon was more than a hard worker. He was a clever man who was able to understand a situation and make wise decisions to avoid danger. Yes, Jehovah saw Gideon’s abilities and trained him.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) How was Jehovah’s view of Amos different from that of some Israelites? (b) How do we know that Amos was not a poor choice?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Similarly, Jehovah saw potential in the prophet Amos. To many, he may have seemed to be a quiet, unimportant man. He was doing very simple work as a shepherd and a field worker. But Jehovah assigned Amos to correct the ten tribes of Israel who had stopped worshipping Him. Some Israelites might have thought that Amos was a poor choice. Why?<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:7:14-30:7:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Amos 7:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

But he knew a lot about the customs and the rulers surrounding him, perhaps from men who traveled through his village on business. For example, Amos knew much about the nations nearby and the bad conditions in Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:1:6-30:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Amos 1:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:1:9-30:1:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:1:11-30:1:11" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:1:13-30:1:13" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:2:8-30:2:8" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 2:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:6:4-30:6:6" data-bid="6-6" class="b"> 6:4-6</a>) Also, Amos was a good writer. He was able to use simple but powerful words. He was not afraid to condemn the corrupt priest Amaziah. Truly, Jehovah had chosen the right person to deliver his message. He saw abilities in Amos that others may not have seen.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:7:12-30:7:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Amos 7:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:7:16-30:7:17" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah notices the abilities of all of his servants, and he wants to help each of us to do the very best we can. For example, Jehovah promised that he would guide David and give him the advice he needed. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 32:8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Why is this encouraging to us? Even though we may not be confident in ourselves, Jehovah can help us to do more than we ever imagined. Just as a good teacher might guide an inexperienced student every step of the way, Jehovah guides us so that we can reach our full potential. And he may use our brothers and sisters to help us to do that. In what ways?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How can we “look out” for the interests of our brothers and sisters?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Paul encouraged all Christians to “look out” for the interests of their brothers and sisters. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>What was included in this counsel? That we should notice the abilities of our brothers and mention them. How do you feel when someone notices a good quality in you? You feel like making more progress. The same is true with our brothers. If we take the time to notice the efforts that our brothers make, they will be encouraged to make progress and succeed in their service to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>Who especially need our attention?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>At times, we all need attention from others. But young or newly baptized brothers especially need to feel involved in the congregation. This will help them to understand that they are a useful part of Jehovah’s people. The Bible encourages these brothers to qualify for more responsibilities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:1</a>) But if they do not feel appreciated for the work that they do, this may discourage them from doing more in Jehovah’s service.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>(a) How did one elder help a young brother to make progress? (b) What do you learn from Julien’s experience?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>An elder named Ludovic says that when sincere interest is shown in a brother, he makes progress more quickly. One such brother was Julien. Ludovic noticed that Julien was shy, and when he tried to do more in the congregation, Julien was unsure of <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>himself and behaved in an awkward way. Ludovic says, “But I could see that he was very kind and really wanted to help.” So instead of criticizing Julien, Ludovic focused on his good qualities and encouraged him. As a result, Julien was able to qualify to become a ministerial servant and later a regular pioneer.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If we want to help our brothers to reach their full potential, we need to see more than their weaknesses. We need to look for their good qualities and abilities. Jesus was able to do this with the apostle Peter. At times, Peter did not seem to be dependable. But Jesus saw good qualities in him and gave him the name Peter, which means “A Piece of Rock.” Hence, Jesus said that he would become as stable as a rock.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:42-43:1:42" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 1:42</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Let us also review the example of Barnabas and Mark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:25-44:12:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 12:25</a>) Mark was supposed to care for the needs of Paul and Barnabas during their first missionary trip. But suddenly, when they reached the area of Pamphylia, Mark abandoned them. Paul and Barnabas were left to travel alone through a dangerous region. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:5-44:13:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 13:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:13-44:13:13" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 13</a>) What did Barnabas do? It seems that he focused on Mark’s good qualities, not on his weaknesses. He did not view Mark as unreliable. Instead, Barnabas later trained Mark, and as a result, he became a mature Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:37-44:15:39" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 15:37-39</a>) Years later, Mark was in Rome assisting Paul, who was in prison. And when Paul wrote to the Colossians, he spoke well of Mark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:10-51:4:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 4:10</a>) Can you imagine how pleased Barnabas must have felt when Paul even asked for Mark’s help?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:11-55:4:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>An elder named Alexandre remembers how a brother helped him: “When I was younger, saying a prayer in public was a real struggle for me. An elder showed me how to prepare myself and be more relaxed. Instead of not calling on me anymore, he gave me opportunities to pray regularly at meetings for field service. In time, I became more confident.”</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>How did Paul show that he valued his brothers?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>What do you do when you see <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>good qualities in other Christians? Do you commend them? In <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:16:1-45:16:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans chapter 16</a>, Paul acknowledged more than 20 of his brothers and sisters for qualities that he valued.

Consider the example of Rico, a young boy in France whose father did not serve Jehovah. Rico was very discouraged because his father did not want him to get baptized. He was afraid that he would have to wait until he was an adult to do so. Rico was also sad that children at school made fun of him because of his beliefs. But an elder named Frédéric commended Rico, telling him that the opposition he faced meant that he was courageous enough to preach. As a result of these kind words, Rico was determined to continue making progress, and he improved his relationship with his father. Rico got baptized when he was 12 years old.</p>

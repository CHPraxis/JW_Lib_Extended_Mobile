<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Since our redesigned Web site was launched, online requests for Bible studies have increased dramatically. Additional requests have been generated by new public witnessing initiatives. The branch office processes these as quickly as possible. For example, if a request is made on jw.org, the elders in the interested person’s territory often receive notification from the branch office just two days later. Reports from the field indicate, however, that some who request a Bible study have not been contacted for several weeks. How can we ensure that help is given before the person’s interest fades?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:4:14-41:4:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 4:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If a person who does not live in your territory shows interest, <em>promptly </em>fill out a <em>Please Follow Up </em>(S-43) form and give it to the secretary <em>no later than your next meeting. Within a day or two, </em>the secretary should give the information to the appropriate congregation or submit it to the branch office using the Congregation tab on jw.org. Elders should check the Web site <em>regularly. </em>If they receive a notice to call on someone, they should follow through <em>quickly.</em> Any publisher asked to make the call should consider it a <em>priority. </em>If the person is not at home, perhaps you could leave a note with your contact information.</p>

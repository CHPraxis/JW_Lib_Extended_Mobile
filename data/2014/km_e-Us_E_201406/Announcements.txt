▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men under the age of 26 who are (1) citizens and have reached 18 years of age or (2) noncitizens who move to the United States must register within 30 days. From the time a man registers until he turns 26, he must notify Selective Service within ten days of any change of address. Elders should remind those to whom this applies or will soon apply of their duty to register.—Rom. 13:1.
▪ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

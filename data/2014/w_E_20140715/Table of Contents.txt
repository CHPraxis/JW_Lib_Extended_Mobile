STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “Jehovah Knows Those Who Belong to Him”
▪  Jehovah’s People “Renounce Unrighteousness”
These articles explore the meaning of what we read at 2 Timothy 2:19, and they show how this text relates to events in Moses’ day. Learn how Christians today can show that they ‘belong to Jehovah’ and that they are ‘renouncing unrighteousness.’

▪  “You Are My Witnesses”
▪  “You Will Be Witnesses of Me”
In these articles we will consider the significance of our being called Jehovah’s Witnesses. See how taking pride in witnessing about both Jehovah and Jesus calls on us to be zealous in our witnessing work and to glorify God and Christ by our holy conduct.

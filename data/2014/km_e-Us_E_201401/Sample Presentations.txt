To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in February

“People we speak to have different opinions about the Bible. Some believe it’s God’s Word, while others view it as just an ordinary book. How do you feel about the Bible?” Allow for response. Show the back of the February 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.



The Watchtower February 1

“Most people would like to see an end to war. Do you think that world peace is a realistic goal? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Scriptures promise. [Read Psalm 46:9.] Interestingly, events that occurred during World War I and thereafter give us confidence that very soon God will fulfill this prophecy and end war forever. This magazine explains.”



Awake! February

“We’re visiting briefly to discuss a common problem. It seems that there’s never enough time to accomplish everything. Do you think that our schedules are full because we have too much to do or because we waste too much of our time? [Allow for response.] Many are not aware that the Bible gives practical advice to help us manage time. Here’s one example. [Read Philippians 1:10a.] This magazine outlines four strategies that have helped many people to use their time more wisely.”

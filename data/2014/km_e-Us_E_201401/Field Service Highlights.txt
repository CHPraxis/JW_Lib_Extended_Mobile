We are happy to report that 4,705 newly dedicated ones were baptized during the month of July 2013. Also, 804 books, 351 brochures, and 291 magazines were requested by interested persons submitting coupons found in our publications. Like leaven, the Kingdom-preaching work promotes spiritual growth with Jehovah’s blessing.—Matt. 13:33.

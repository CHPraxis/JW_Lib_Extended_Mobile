THE ANTITYPICAL JUBILEE BEGINNING 

Some of our readers have been disturbed by one item 
relative to the beginning of the antitypical Jubilee in the 
September number of the Overland Monthly. Nothing in that 
article is intended to be different or contradictory to our 
presentations in the SCRIPTURE STUDIES showing the year 1875 
A.D. as the opening year of the antitypical Jubilee of a thousand 
years. In the Overland article we merely showed that 
the seventy years destruction of Jerusalem in the days of 
Daniel represented Israel's entire Jubilee system. We 
showed two ways of counting it:— 

(1) Seventy times fifty equals 3,500 years; 

(2) Nineteen times fifty plus fifty-one times forty-nine 
equals 3,449 years ending with 1874, marking 1875 as the 
first year of the antitypical Jubilee. 

The latter is, to our understanding, the proper method 
of counting the Jubilee and agrees perfectly with our presentation 
of the matter in SCRIPTURE STUDIES, Volume II.

VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER 

SIGNS OF RESTITUTION CONTINUE 

THE United States Government is experimenting 

with a new kind of wheat recently found 

in Palestine by Dr. Aaronsohn. Experiments 

are being made in the arid districts of the 

far West, where ordinary wheat failed for 

lack of moisture. The claim made for the 

new wheat is that it is really the very oldest 

of all the various wheats— the original or 

wild wheat, the parent from which all other 

wheats have descended. Lost for a long 

time, it is now coming to the front again. Dr. Aaronsohn 

declares his belief that not only wheat, but oats, barley 

and rye originated in Syria and Palestine. He claims 

for this parent or wild wheat that it endures the most 

extreme climatic conditions, enduring more cold and more 

heat than other varieties, and subsisting with almost no 

moisture. He claims also that it is not subject to the 

pest which attacks others. What will our evolutionist 

friends think of this— that the parent wheat is better 

than any of its children. 

Wheat is the great staple of the world, and, used with 
milk as a diet, it supplies really everything essential to 
the maintenance of the human system; hence, as the New 
Dispensation will be ushered in, the matter of wheat will 
be an important one. Dr. Aaronsohn says, "It seems to me 
that we are justified in hoping to produce races of wheat 
better adapted to the semi-arid regions of Algeria, Tunis, 
Syria, Egypt and Turkestan, as well as to those of America. 
If we secure races that will enable us to increase 
the yield by as much as one bushel per acre on these vast 
areas, the world's total production of wheat will be materially 



augmented." 

MIRACLE WHEAT AND MIRACLE RYE 

Some years ago we made mention of the miracle wheat 
discovered in Virginia, which originated with the fruitage 
of one grain found growing by itself. Two grains of this 
wheat were given to the Editor, who, in turn, handed 
them to a brother in the Truth, who reported that the two 
grains produced 1,312, which, planted, produced five 
pounds— one grain having fifty stools of well-developed 
stalks or straws. The brother planted the miracle wheat 

R4689 : page 307 

alongside of some ordinary wheat, and reports that the 
miracle wheat heads are from three to five inches long 
and from three to five grains to the mesh, whereas with 
the common wheat the heads are from two to three inches 
in length. 

Another brother obtained some of the miracle wheat 
and, out of the first crop, presented the Editor a peck of 
the same. This was entrusted to another brother, a 
farmer, who has just handed the Editor $ 100 proceeds 
therefrom, with the following report:— 

As you remember, I secured also a peck of the miracle 
wheat from a brother in the Truth as a donation to yourself 
(because he first heard of the miracle wheat through 
THE WATCH TOWER). This was sowed on half an acre 
of run-out land. On the adjoining half-acre was sowed a 
bushel of common wheat for comparison. The sowing 
was done in the midst of a seven weeks' drouth. During 
the late fall and the early spring the miracle wheat looked 
very thin compared with the common wheat. However, 
in the month of May both plots appeared to be about the 
same, except that the miracle wheat laid flatter on the 
ground. Late in June the miracle wheat was much the 
heavier, and stood nearly a foot higher than the common 
wheat, and about a week later in point of ripening. Not 
having threshed, I cannot at this writing report the respective 
yield, but am satisfied that the miracle wheat will 
be more than double that of the common. 

The grains are in appearance similar to ordinary red 
wheat. I can with difficulty distinguish a difference. The 
color of the miracle wheat is a trifle richer. I will send 
you a photograph of a dozen heads and the largest stool 
I can find of both the miracle and the common wheat. 
Brother Kuesthardt advertised the wheat in his paper, 
and the money sent you is the result of the sales at $ 1 
per pound. 

Your brother in Christ, J. A. BOHNET. 



RABBI SALE AN IDEAL CONGREGATIONALIST 



The public press reports the following sentiments expressed 
by a prominent Hebrew Rabbi:— 

"Orthodoxy as it is known today, with its doctrines, 
creeds and dogmas of the Trinity, the communion, of heaven 
and of hell, has been given a severe jolt by Rabbi Samuel 
Sale, of the Shaare Emeth Hebrew Congregation, in an address 
before a body of Christian ministers at the Congregational 
Ministers' meeting at the First Congregational Church. 

"Rabbi Sale's remarks brought a breathless silence among 
his hearers, and his expressions regarding the "universal religion" 
created a sensation. 

"In the views of Rabbi Sale his Satanic Majesty, starring 
through the ages as a figure of ignominy and evil, is given a 
new role, in which he is only a negative force and becomes 
a servant of God, not a rival, in the activities of men. Heaven 
is declared to be not a place for future preferment, but a 
condition to be realized here, now and forever. Hell is abolished, 

R4689 : page 308 

as being no justifiable disposition for those not qualified 
for eternal bliss. Adam and Eve are relieved from responsibility 
in the matter of original sin. The Bible, said to be as 
great a composite as Homer's Iliad or the Odyssey, is about 
as fallible as these. It is not a book of plenary inspiration, 
Doctor Sale asserted, for the only reliable scroll of the Law 
or the Word of God is the intelligent consciousness of 
the individual man. 

"Rabbi Sale denies the Jews the privilege of being the 
chosen people, except in their own estimation. Christianity, 
as it is known today, with its foundation doctrines of the 
Trinity, communion and metaphysical difficulties, Doctor Sale 
classified as an aftergrowth, and entirely foreign to the exalted 
simplicity of the lowly Nazarene. 

CREEDS BLAMED AS BARRIERS 

"The jealous assumptions of creeds and dogmas, with 
their insistence on incidentals, conventions and artificialities, 
are blamed by Dr. Sale as the barriers which prevent the 
realization of the ideal religion— that preached of in the 
prophetic writings— the worship of God in the service of man. 

"In serious mien, Doctor Sale smiled solemnly at the traditional 
idea that God revealed his laws in the beginning 
exclusively to the Jew. It was a very natural idea for the Jew 
to entertain, he thought. Choosing his words slowly and reflectively, 
he said: 'Not to Israel, not to man of any creed, 
sect or nationality, but to man, has God revealed himself. 
Not in the scroll, not in the Bible, is his infallible Word, but 
in the intelligent consciousness of every individual.' 

"When he had concluded, there was a moment of thoughtful 
silence on the part of the audience, when Doctor Albert H. 
Jordan arose and said:— 

'"That was great' 

'"We'd like to make you a Congregationalist, Doctor Sale,' 
a minister observed." 



"The intelligent consciousness of the individual" was 
indeed God's original writing of his Law— in the first 
perfect man, created in his Maker's likeness. But the 
Bible tells truly that all of Adam's children are blemished 
by sin, and by its death penalty. What about people who 
have only unintelligent consciousness! And what about 
the thousands of gradations of unintelligent consciousness 
—all men! God gave a revealed religion for these 
in the Bible! Only those intelligently unconscious of 
their ignorance disdain it! 



CHURCH FEDERATION AT THE DOOR 

While the religious world has been waiting for the 
slow processes of denominational action to bring about 
Church Federation in a couple of years or more, some 
active ministers in various parts are hastening the matter 
by methods of their own. The latest of these movements, 
as well as the one nearest home, is described in The 
New York World as follows:— 

"Protestant ministers in New York have taken a step that 
may lead, so they hope, to a united Protestantism in New 
York and eventually in all America. The meeting was held 
upon invitation of the Federation of Churches, and one hundred 
ministers present were made up of Baptists, Congregationalists, 
Disciples, Seventh Day Adventists, Episcopalians, 
Quakers, Lutherans, Methodists, Moravians, Presbyterians, 
Pentecostal Nazarines, Reformed Swedenborgians, Unitarians, 
Universalists and three ministers who said they did not belong 
to any of these. 

"This, the most remarkable religious gathering ever held 
in New York City, was called a clerical conference. The 
Bronx and Brooklyn were represented as well as Manhattan. 
It was the first gathering, but it was announced that it is to 
be continued with regular monthly meetings, save during the 
summer. 

"Among the ministers present were the foremost leaders 
in all the bodies named. All of the eight speakers asserted 
that hereafter Protestants are going to show a united front. 
Bishop Greer of the Episcopal Church presided. 

BISHOP GREER OPTIMISTIC 

'"We hear at times,' he said, 'that the churches are failing. 
It is not true. The churches are well filled, some of them 
crowded, and the proportion of men attending them is greater 
than ever. We are all well aware of the sin prevalent in our 
midst. But it has always been prevalent. The gain is that 
the churches now know it exists, and are doing something to 
stamp it out.' 

"Speaking for Presbyterians, the Rev. Dr. George Alexander, 



moderator of the New York Presbytery, declared they 
stand ready to meet Episcopalians half way. Bishop Greer 
had mentioned the moderator by name, saying he wished he 
might have the privilege of laying on of hands upon such a 
leader as he. Replying, the veteran Presbyterian leader said 
he would not seriously object. It surely would not hurt him, 
and it might do good. He allowed there are some Presbyterians 
in New York who stand on what they are pleased to 
call their principles, but he added that some who have few 
principles manufacture them out of their prejudices. 

"The Rev. Nehemiah Boynton of Brooklyn, speaking for 
Congregationalists, enumerated the political, social, amusement, 
Sabbath rest, labor and other questions on which, he 
said, Protestants might unite. 

A STRONG LIST OF SPEAKERS 

"Other speakers included the Rev. Dr. J. B. Remensnyder, 
who spoke for Lutherans; the Rev. Dr. F. Mason North, 
who believed the Methodists would join heartily; the Rev. 
Dr. Swift of the American Tract Society, who wondered how 
many religious bodies are 'willing to sacrifice their names in 
order that the cause of Christ may be advanced.' 

"In closing, Bishop Greer stated that the next matter in 
hand is to hear from representatives of each body in the 
conference what are their hindrances to co-operation. The 
Bishop believed the time in America to be ripe for unity, and 
declared that the Episcopal Church stands ready to aid. 

"The conference membership is to be much enlarged until, 
if possible, it includes all of the Protestant ministers in the 
greater city. The Unitarians and Universalists are usually 
barred in such meetings, but both were present, three men 
from each." 

"THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST" 

Here we have exactly what we have been looking and 
waiting for since 1881, when we announced the Federation 
of the Protestant Churches to be set forth in the 
Bible as one of the prominent features of the harvest of 
this Gospel Age. We then pointed out that the attempt 
to organize Protestantism, first made in 1846 through the 
Evangelical Alliance, would reach consummation soon. 
We pointed to the Scriptures which indicate that this 
Protestant Federation will so considerably resemble the 
Roman Catholic Institutions as to properly deserve to be 
called its "Image," and that the "Image" already existed 

R4690 : page 308 

in a disorganized condition, as represented in the terms 
of Protestant orthodoxy and their co-operation with 
Catholicism. We pointed out that the important matter 
waited on and necessary to the power and activity of the 
Protestant "Image" is the "life" which it is to receive 
from the Protestant Episcopal System. 



Up to the present time Protestant denominations have 
hesitated to pronounce anybody or anything heretical, except 
as each denomination may have occasionally done 
this within its own borders. There has been a strong desire 
to formulate a creed which would have the support 
of all and permit the denouncing of everything outside 
of it. But the way to do this was not heretofore clear, 
because the retort might be, By what authority do you 
set yourself up as a judge of what is orthodox and what 
is unorthodox? What have you more than your own 
opinion of the Bible's teaching? Have you any authority 
more than others? Produce the authority. 

The fear of being thus questioned has exercised a 
salutary effect heretofore, except with the ignorant. But 
when the various ministers of other denominations shall 
have in considerable numbers accepted re-ordination as 
ministers at the hands of Episcopalian Bishops, matters 
will be different. Speedily the validity of other ordination 
will be questioned. The authority of this so-called 

R4690 : page 309 

"Apostolic Ordination" will give seeming right of authority, 

dignity and power. After the prominent ministers 

of various denominations shall have submitted themselves 

to such re-ordination the "lesser lights" will make 

a rush for it. The Episcopal Church proffered it on easy 

terms years ago, and the only objection to its acceptance 

has been the fact that it implies that Protestant ministers 

heretofore have been without Divine authority, sanction, 

power or ordination to preach the Gospel as God's 

ambassadors. 

"THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND" 

The situation is becoming strenuous. The great ministers 
realize that with their own teachings and those of 
the colleges along the lines of Higher Criticism and Evolution, 
intelligent Christians are rapidly losing faith in 
the Bible. These ministers realize that this places Society 
in a dangerous position— that without faith in some 
higher authority, civilization would soon drift into anarchy. 
They feel the need of a substitute for the Bible— 
the need of some voice to address the people authoritatively. 
The desired end, they believe, can be best secured 
through the Federation of the Churches and the 
coming of all ministers of the Gospel under the Episcopal 
ordination. Then, they think, we will present to the 
world a large system and a bold front and command their 
attention to the voice of the Church and the Voice of 
God coming down through the "apostolic succession"— 
just as the Catholics do— a mild "Image" of Catholicism, 
but full of its power and vigor. 

The Scriptures show that by the time this Catholic 
power and vigor and "apostolic-succession" authority are 
felt by the Federators, a spirit of autocracy and persecution 



of everything contrary to the Federation and contrary 

to Catholicism, of which it is to be the "Image," 

will be dealt with more and more severely, energetically 

and ruthlessly, as the masses fall in line with the Federative 

Movement and catch its spirit of bigness, dignity, 

power, authority— a spirit very different from that inculcated 

by the Master and the Apostles in meekness, gentleness, 

patience, long-suffering, brotherly-kindness, love. 

Far be it from us to suppose that the gentlemen participating 
in the meeting described foregoing are animated 
by all the vicious malevolence which the Scriptures indicate 
will ultimately result. On the contrary, they little 
realize the end of the road upon which they are entering. 
It is a case of the blind leading the blind. As the Scriptures 
indicate, the ditch is before them— the ditch of anarchy, 
the very thing which they are desirous of averting. 
To us the Scriptures indicate that the prosperity of the 
Federated Protestant "Image" will for a little time be so 
great, so pronounced, and its arrogance become so great 
that the sympathy of the masses will be entirely alienated 
and turned into bitterness. Hence the Scriptures show us 
that the climax will come suddenly, unexpectedly, "In one 
hour."-Rev. 13:15-17. 



IS THE WORLD BETTER? 

"Commenting on Dr. C. W. Eliot's statement that 
'The world has been re-made within fifty years,' Thomas 
E. Watson, the Southern statesman and publicist, responds 
with the inquiry, 'Is the newly made world of today 
a better world than that of fifty years ago?' Mr. 
Watson, answering his own question, wrote:— 

"It seems to be a fact that a large percentage of the people 
have departed from the old faith, in the matter of religion. 
It seems to me that this is indisputably true; but does the man 
who loses his faith in Christianity become a better man on 
that account? Is the scoffing son or grandson of the New 
England Puritan a higher, nobler type than was his pious forefather? 
Is the preacher's son who is an infidel a more useful 
citizen than the preacher father? 

"Again, are we an honester, more temperate people than 
were the Americans of fifty years ago? What is the exact 
social and moral significance of the fifty or sixty thousand 
divorces that are being granted by the courts annually? What 
weight is to be given to the fact that President Roosevelt appointed 
a commission to investigate existing conditions in 
the homes of the people of cities, and that this report, officially 
made after painstaking investigation, revealed such an appalling 
state of affairs that the government decided it would 
be advisable to suppress the publication? 

"Again, what is the real meaning of the astounding size of 
our yearly drink bill? And what is implied by the infinite 
variety and ingenuity of the devices invented to keep us from 
stealing? Every time you go into a store you are bound to 



be reminded of the fact that the proprietor places no confidence 
in the employee and the employee places none in the 
proprietor. 

"In the cash drawer, in the system of collecting 
fares on street cars and railway trains, in the check and 
counter-check at the hotels, in the elaborate system of the 
banks, in the expensive safe vaults provided against the 
burglar, the robber and the sneak thief— in fact, in every 
direction that our eyes take in the business world, we are 
bound to see that commerce goes upon the idea that every man 
will steal if he gets the opportunity, and the whole trend of 
the ingenious, elaborate, and constantly changing system is 
to take away the chance to steal. The entire precautional 
system cries out: 'Every one of us will steal if you don't 
watch us!' Was it that bad fifty years ago? 

"We cannot agree with Mr. Watson, because of what 
he sees to commend in the past, that the people as a whole 
are not very much better conditioned than they were half 
a century ago. The writer here, who has almost reached 
the three score and ten, has seen great progress in the improvement 
of human life and living, much more than the 
most optimistic fancy of his boyhood days could have 
dared to imagine. 

"Mr. Watson, who, by the way, is an ardent Baptist 
and clings most tenaciously to the 'old faith,' wants to 
know if the liberal religious teachings of today have made 
the present day American a more useful citizen than his 
orthodox father. We think it has. It is within our remembrance 
when there was constant warfare between 
the rival sects. The Catholics were denounced by the 
Protestants and the Protestants were as roundly abused 
by the Catholics. Liberalism has changed this."— The 
Sunday Call. 



There are two sides to nearly every question— sometimes 
three. Two sides of a question are discussed foregoing. 
The third side, which harmonizes both, and 
which we believe is the Truth, is this:— 

Moral standards of the world in general certainly have 
improved in many respects. The world as a whole is more 
intelligent, broader-minded and more benevolent than in 
the past. It is along religious lines that we seem to see 
an unfavorable comparison. The light and liberty of our 
day have overbalanced many of the best minds of the 
world and led into Higher Criticism, Evolution and various 
other doctrines contrary to the Scriptures. As a result, 
Christian faith is weak and sterling Christian character 
is becoming scarce. Our Lord prayed, "Sanctify them 
through thy Truth; thy Word is Truth." And we are 
learning that there can be no sanctification without the 
Truth. Hence the decline in Christianity, because of the 
departure from the Divine standard. True, indeed, many 
of the things believed by our fathers were unscriptural. 
True, indeed, many of the sentiments of the world today 



are sounder and clearer and more logical and more 
God-like. 

If our forefathers had presented only errors, the loss 
of them would have been beneficial, rather than otherwise. 
However, with the errors, they had truths derived from 

R4690 : page 310 

the same Word of God and their faith rested upon a 
sure foundation, even though it was blemished, imperfect. 
A blemished faith is much better than no faith. And 
hence, from this standpoint, today is less favorable than 
fifty years ago. We could not expect Prof. Eliot, nor any 
other Higher Critic disbeliever in the Bible, to see the matter 
from our standpoint. Nor shall we try. It is our part to 
do what we can for the establishment of faith and for 
the purging of it from all the inconsistencies and errors 
of the "dark ages"— the restoring of faith to its original 
simplicity and purity. In so far as we succeed in ourselves 
or others, we know that the result will bring a 
blessing and sanctification, under which all the light and 
blessing of this present time will be helpful in a proper 
approach toward God and appreciation of his character 
and Word. 



R4691 : page 310 

"WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?" 

From "The Life of Faith." 

WATCHMAN, what of the night? The watchman 

said, The morning cometh." (Isaiah 21:11,12.) 

The nineteenth century beheld, 

perhaps, the most amazing progress the 

Church of Christ has ever experienced. A 

little more than a hundred years ago there 

was no Bible Society; today three Anglo-Saxon 

Bible Societies alone pour forth annually 

over ten million portions of the 

Scriptures, in four to five hundred languages 

of the world. Can any imagination conceive the spiritual 

effect of this mighty river of Truth pouring itself among 

all mankind? A little more than a hundred years ago 

missionary societies— apart from the Jesuit and Moravian 

—were practically unknown; in 1909 there were 19,875 

missionaries scattered, as living epistles of Christ, 

through the heathen world. It would be difficult to say 

what was the membership of God's Church when the 

century dawned; but it is now computed that the membership 

of Protestant Evangelical communions is not less 

than one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty 

millions. It is possible that eternity will reveal to us 

that the nineteenth century was the richest toward God 



of any century in the world's history. 

Nor does God's worldwide advance slacken; the last 
decade is probably the most wonderful of all. "The 
morning cometh!" More educated converts have been 
won in India in the last two decades than in the whole 
preceding century. Bishop Moule, of Mid-China, says 
that when he first landed in that Empire it held less than 
fifty Protestant Christians; in the first decade of the 
twentieth century there have been 16,000 martyrs; and 
nearly two thousand missionaries are now planted 
throughout China. A little over twenty years ago the 
Christians in all Korea numbered seven; in 1908, alone, 
there were fifty thousand converts; and, at a recent conference 
of twelve hundred laymen, some walked for ten 
days to enjoy the Bible study. In Tokachi prison, in 
Kokkaido, Japan, a spiritual movement, sweeping through 
it in 1908, brought nearly two thousand of the inmates to 
Christ, and most of the prison officials have been baptized. 
Four years after the Welsh revival, in spite of the 
reaction, from sixty to seventy thousand converts were 
known to be established in church fellowship. The census 
bureau of the United States, reports that, between 1890 
and 1906, an average of eight new churches had been 
built every day. It has been recently stated that within 
the last decade more Jews have become believers (it is, 
of course, but an approximate computation) than in all 
the seventeen hundred years after Paul. 

All these are but symptoms of a work of the holy 
Spirit which is nothing short of stupendous. For the 
first time since our Lord ascended, nearly the whole world 
is now open to the Gospel, and is being penetrated by 
heralds of the Cross. The year 1908 was a phenomenal 
one in missionary advance; 164,674 native members were 
added to the Church, or an average of five hundred a day. 
Nor is the heroism of the Cross confined to any Christian 
group. Dr. Ambrose Shepherd recently met a young 
Roman Catholic priest in a railway carriage, on a farewell 
visit to his mother before leaving for the Congo. 
"When do you expect to come back?" Dr. Shepherd 
asked. "Never," was the reply; "we have buried fifteen 
already, and the average period of life is about two 
years"; and when the young priest arose to take farewell, 
in a voice that trembled with emotion, he said, "The life 
which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the 
Son of God." 

"The watchman said, And also the night." The facts 
are not more antithetical than are the words of the 
watchman. "Of no time in the history of the world," 
said The Times recently, "are so many signs of general 
unrest recorded as those which seem to confront us today"; 
or, in the words of the Bible Society's report 
(1909), "The horoscope of the future is written over 
with signs of incalculable change." As the Rev. James 
Johnston has pointed out in his, "A Century of Missions," 
the heathen and Mohammedan population of the world 
counts more by two hundred millions than a hundred 



years ago, while the converts and their families number 
less than three millions; a seventy-fold increase of the 
darkness over the light. There are millions more of 
heathen souls in China today than when the first Protestant 
missionary landed a hundred years ago; for every 
convert added to the Church a thousand souls are added 
to Chinese heathendom by mere growth of population. 
"If our plans of education be followed up," said Lord 
Macaulay in 1836, "there will not be a single idolator 
among the respectable classes in Bengal thirty years 
hence"; today there is a false god for every member of 
the population of India— between two and three hundred 
millions. In Japan there are four hundred and fifty 
heathen temples for every single Christian missionary. 
There are 400,000,000 of mankind who have not a leaf of 
the Bible in their 2,700 languages and dialects. 

Nor is faith what it was in the lands of faith. In 
1908, in the State Church in Berlin alone, the fall in membership 
was ten thousand persons. The Bible Society 
reports that the sale of the Scriptures is falling. In 
Liverpool— the third city of the empire— in 1881, 40 seats 
out of every 100 were filled at morning worship in the 
Free Churches; in 1891, 31; in 1902, 25; in 1908, 12. So 
also evening attendance has fallen from 57 in every 100 
seats in 1881, to 28 in 1908. "Tom Paine's work," says 
the editor of the Freethinker, "is now carried on by the 
descendants of his persecutors; all he said about the Bible 
is being said in substance by orthodox divines from 
chairs of theology." At the last census in France, eight 
millions enrolled themselves as atheists; "We have driven 
Jesus Christ," says the Premier, M. Briand, "out of the 
army, the navy, the schools, the hospitals, the lunatic 
asylums, and the orphanages; we must now drive him 

R4691 : page 311 

out of the State altogether." This decay in faith is already 

producing its inevitable recoil in morality. While 

the population of the United States has grown one hundred 

per cent., crime has increased by four hundred per 

cent. The decade of unprecedented revivals— in Wales, 

Madagascar, Korea, China— is the decade of unparalleled 

earthquakes— at Valparaiso, San Francisco, Jamaica, Messina; 

it would seem as if grace is speaking her loudest 

as the earth trembles with premonitory judgments. The 

vast revival in Moslem lands; the flood of infidel literature 

which Japan is pouring into China, a fourth of the 

human race; the mushroom growth of such spiritisms as 

Spiritualism and Christian Science; the actual rumors of 

the rebuilding of Babylon and the Temple— "the watchman 

said, And also the night." 

"The watchman said, If ye will inquire, inquire ye." 
"If the light that is in us be darkness, how great is the 
darkness"; and if the Lamp of Prophecy be extinguished, 
how inextricable is the confusion. "Inquire ye." Why 
inquire? Because the future which God has revealed, is 



the future which I ought to know; because without a 
knowledge of prophecy, the present workings of God are 
plunged in unintelligible mystery; because prophecy uncovers 
the pitfalls that lie in our path; because a knowledge 
of the future is of incalculable importance in shaping 
the present. Hear the watchman's mournful undertone: 
"If ye will inquire, inquire ye." It is a strange 
irony of the situation that worldly eyes can read the 
signs more acutely than the general Church. Says a 
novelist whose works sell by the hundred thousand, in 
many languages: 

"All things that Christ prophesied are coming to pass 
so quickly that I wonder more people do not realize it; 
and I especially wonder at the laxity and apathy of the 
Churches, except for the fact that this also was prophesied. 
Some of us will live to see a time of terror, and 
that before very long. The blasphemous things which 
are being done in the world today cannot go on much 
longer without punishment. We know by history that 
deliberate scorn of God and Divine things has always 
been met by retribution of a sudden and terrible nature— 
and it will be so again." 

Prophecy is the profoundest pessimism and the profoundest 
optimism; it is profoundly pessimistic of all that 
a Christ-rejecting generation is about to do; it is profoundly 
optimistic of all that an almighty and an all-gracious 
God will effect in the imminent establishment of 
his Kingdom. Dr. Kelman recently asked an eminent 
American man of science his solution of the problems of 
modern city life. "An emperor!" came the answer, swift 
and decisive. "An emperor?" asked Dr. Kelman, in surprise; 
"I thought you had done with all that in America. 
Besides, your emperor would need to be a very wonderful 
man, incapable of mistakes, and extraordinarily competent 
for leadership." "Precisely," was the quiet answer; 
"and we know the Man; we are waiting for him, and his 
name is— Messiah." "The thrill of that reply," says Dr. 
Kelman, "will never leave me." 

"The Watchman said, Turn ye; come." It may be 
that some unbelieving eyes may alight upon these words. 
The Rabbis expound the Watchman, who speaks here, as 
the Messiah; so it is— "turn ye"— repentance toward God; 
and "come"— faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Why 
thus turn and come? Because, to press forward, if we 
are right, is to press forward amid perhaps the mightiest 
operations ever put forth on a worldwide scale by the 
holy Spirit. 

"The difficulty in the world today is not to 
find God, but to escape him. Because every moment that 
a world hardens itself against Divine light, an atmosphere 
is being produced in which it is every moment 
more difficult to believe. Because, if to Chorazin and 
Bethsaida, after three years of Gospel opportunity, Jesus 
said, "It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon," 
shall it not also be said of our cities, after a thousand 



R4692: page 311 

years of opportunity? Because nineteen hundred years 
ago the Night was far spent, and the Day was at hand; 
there can be no time to lose now. The day before the 
wall of fire rolled down on St. Pierre, the telephone clerk 
spoke through to Fort de France, saying that the people 
were fleeing. Next morning, at ten minutes to eight, he 
was heard to exclaim, "My God! it is here!" and he was 
afterwards found, with the receiver in his hand, burnt 
to a cinder. "Watchman, what of the night?" That is, 
what hour of the night is it? "Little children, it is the 
last hour."— I John 2:18. 



R4692: page 311 

ST. PAUL AND MOSES PATRIOTS EXTRAORDINARY 

"For I could wish that myself were accursed from 
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according 
to the flesh."— Romans 9:3. 

THIS is one of the most patriotic expressions 

to be found in the Bible. It is comparable 

only to the request by Moses in respect to 

the Children of Israel, that if God would 

blot out Israel, he should blot out 

him also from his book of remembrance 

and special favor. We have a very 

high estimation of St. Paul's generosity of 

heart and loyalty of mind to his kinsmen, 

the Jews, and also for that of the 

great Law-Giver. 

We are not, we think, to understand this as though it 
merely read, I do wish myself accursed. Neither are we 
to understand this expression to signify, I could wish myself 
damned; but rather, I could wish myself cut off from 
membership in the Body of Christ, if by my being cut off 
it could be so arranged, in harmony with the Heavenly 
Father's will and provision, that it would benefit my 
brethren, my nation— so that as a whole nation the Israelites 
would constitute the Royal Priesthood and become 
Israel on the spiritual plane. I perceive that they do not 
realize how much they are missing. I feel such a grief 
for them, that having received the promises centuries ago 
and having hoped in these promises (many still hope in 
them) they are now so blinded as to reject the favors of 
God, because it was not on a spiritual plane that they 
anticipated them. If my being cut off from fellowship 
with the Lord Jesus Christ as a member of that Body of 
glory would thus benefit them and were to put me down 
on the plane of the "Great Company," instead of my 
being one of those who would share in the glory of the 
Kingdom, I would be well pleased, indeed, if it were God's 



will, that thus I might have the satisfaction of knowing 
that I had been such a blessing to my own people. 

ST. PAUL'S GREAT UNSELFISHNESS 

We confess that the Apostle's attitude on this subject 
is marvelous. We cannot doubt his sincerity. He was 
proving this in all of his course of life. For one to will 
to sacrifice his place in the Body of Christ for the sake 
of the multitude of his sinful nation, is something very 

R4692: page 312 

wonderful. This, however, is not an example to us— that 
we should say that if we could bring some of our children 
or friends into the Truth we would be willing to be cut 
off for the benefit of these, and thus to subordinate ourselves 
and take the lower position. It is our privilege to 
take the position God has offered us, but those who may 
be able to rise up to so high a standard are worthy of 
admiration because of the grandeur of character implied. 
St. Paul's great unselfishness was one of his grand traits, 
and we think it would be well for each of us to cultivate 
that trait to a greater degree, looking to the interest of 
the brethren, willing to subordinate our own preferences 
and our own ways in certain particulars if we can see 
that this would be an aid to others, especially an aid to a 
number of others. This is the Spirit of Christ; this is 
certainly in full accord with all the instructions of the 
Lord— that we should humble ourselves, and in honor 
prefer one another, even to the extent of self-sacrifice. 
The Apostle's course was self-abnegation to an extent, 
however, that we do not understand the Lord has demanded, 
although he has said, "we ought to lay down 
our lives (our human lives) for the brethren." 

In a sense, we might say that the Jewish nation stood 
related to Saint Paul in much the same way that the 
nominal Christian church of today stands related to the 
fully consecrated. They are our brethren by a nominal 
consecration or nominal profession. Such a relationship 
we ought to feel, we think. We believe this text encourages 
us to feel a great deal of interest in these brethren, 
and to be willing to do a great deal to help them. 
We do not know how many may really be saints and 
merely for the time blinded by the errors which the Adversary 
has caused to be promulgated. "The god of 
this world hath blinded the minds of those who believe 
not." (2 Cor. 4:4.) We understand these words, "believe 
not," to apply not only to an entire lack of faith, 
but to apply also to the various imperfect degrees of development 
of faith in ourselves and in others. What is 
it that has hindered us from reaching the very highest 
attainment of that which God has provided for us? Some 
of these errors are standing in the way. Where did they 
come from. They came from our Adversary. 



"LET NOT SIN HAVE DOMINION OVER YOU" 

And he it is who has completely blinded the heathen 
and has darkened the understanding of Christians, and 
we ought to be glad to do all in our power to remove those 
blinding influences. To whatever extent we do this, to 
whatever extent we are of aid to our brethren in the 
nominal church, it will make us proportionately sympathetic 
with them— not with the systems that are contrary 
to the teachings of the Word, but sympathetic with the 
people who are blinded by the teachings of those systems 
—not sympathetic with the blindness, but with those who 
are experiencing the blindness. The Apostle seems to 
give the thought of a gradual obliteration of blindness 
when he speaks of "the eyes of your understanding 
opening ye might be able to comprehend with all saints," 
etc. So we see that in our own cases it is a gradual opening 
of the eyes of our understanding, and this progresses 
in proportion as we get free from the power of Satan 
and his blinding influences. We get free from these influences 
in proportion as we lay hold upon the Lord 
Jesus Christ and his wonderful provision made for our 
liberation, that we might ultimately stand free in the 
liberty wherewith Christ makes us free. He makes us 
free as the Emancipation Proclamation made the slaves 
free. And yet, after the proclamation is made, it is one 
thing to learn of our liberty and another thing to avail 
ourselves of that liberty and thus to become actually 
free. It takes, perhaps, months or years to gain this full 
liberty from blindness. "Let not sin, therefore, have 
dominion over you."

WISE AND FOOLISH VIRGINS 

-MATTHEW 25:l-13.-OCTOBER 2.- 

Golden Text:— "Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of 
man cometh at an hour when ye think not."— Luke 12:40. 

THE Great Teacher in today's Study tells us 

further about his glorious Messianic Kingdom 

and concerning those who will be 

accounted worthy to share it with him— as 

his Bride. This parable has not been of general 

application all through this Gospel Age. 

It applies merely at the close of the Age 

—at the present time, we believe. It does 

not take into consideration the world, nor 

even the nominal Church, but solely, only, 

the true Church, the Virgin class. The word "virgin" 

signifies pure and in using this term the Lord implies 

that he is referring only to those who have been justified, 



by faith and consecration, because by nature none are 
pure; none are holy; none are virgins. 

FIVE WISE-FIVE FOOLISH 

One of the special lessons of the parable is to 
show that amongst the pure, the wise, the consecrated 
people of God, there are two classes. For a time these 
will be all together— unseparated. But in the fulfilling of 
this parable certain circumstances and conditions and 
truths will develop and separate these two classes of 
saints, virgins. 

The parable shows all the virgins as sleeping, waiting 
for the coming of the Bridegroom. Apparently, there is 
no difference; but really there is a difference— the wise 
had a larger supply of oil than had the foolish. Then 
came an announcement of the presence of the Bridegroom 
and a call to go forth to meet him. This implies that 
something from the prophetic Word at the appropriate 
time will call the attention of all the Virgin class to the 
presence of Messiah. But at the Second Advent it will 
be as it was at the First Advent, when John said of 
Jesus, "Behold there standeth one among you whom ye 
know not." We are not to expect the Second Coming 
of Christ in the flesh, but as a spirit being. 

We are to remember that the Scriptures outline two 
distinct features connected with the Second Coming. 
First will come the parousia or "presence" of the Lord, 
recognizable only by the Wise and Foolish Virgins. In 
his parousia or "presence" he will test and prove his 
Church, dividing them into wise and foolish virgin classes 
—the wise virgins to become the Bride class and the 
foolish virgins to become the class who will experience 

R4693 : page 312 

a second grade of salvation— coming up out of great 
tribulation and becoming the Bridesmaids, so to speak, 
"the virgins, the Bride's Companions, who follow after 
her." (Psa. 45:14.) These will attain great blessings in 
spiritual life, but fail to gain the prize of joint-heirship 
with the Lord in his Throne, in his Kingdom. 

Later on will come the manifestation of Christ with 
his Church, in power and great glory, in the setting up 
of his Messianic Kingdom and in the overthrow of everything 
contrary to it. Concerning this manifestation we 

R4693 : page 313 

read, "When he shall appear, we, also (the Bride class), 
will appear with him in glory."— Col. 3:4. 

It will be in the time of the presence, the parousia, of 
the Son of man, for the gathering of the "elect," that all 
the Virgins will be awakened by the message of the Truth. 
Some will be able to appreciate, others will not be able 
to appreciate his presence. The latter will need to "go 



and buy" the oil, the wisdom, the understanding, of the 
Divine Word. It will cost some of them considerable of 
self-sacrifice and humiliation to learn their lessons. Such 
as obtain the oil in time will join the party that will 
go in with the Bridegroom to the marriage feast. Then 
the door to that High Calling will close forever. 

Thank God that it is not as we once supposed— that 
the door of mercy is to close, shutting out the foolish 
Virgins of the Church, together with the whole world of 
mankind; and, as we once supposed, shutting them into 
eternal torment. The parable merely shows that the 
closed door will exclude any others from coming into the 
Bride class, to be joint-heirs with Messiah in his Kingdom. 
The door will close because the full number elected 
and predestinated to this high honor will have attained 
the necessary character-likeness of Christ and will have 
stood the necessary testings. 

As no one of the Jewish priests could ever serve as 
High Priest if he had a superfluous finger or toe, it is 
thus shown in the type that the antitypical High Priest, 
the Messiah, will have only a definite, fixed number of 
members in his Body— neither one too few nor one too 
many. Later on, the foolish Virgins came to the "door," 
but found it forever shut. They lost the great prize. 
They were foolish in that they did not give attention to 
getting the oil in time; foolish also in that they cared 
too much for the things of this present life; but they 
were Virgins, nevertheless. They finally got the oil, 
which represents the holy Spirit, but too late! The door 
was shut! They could not be of the Bride class. The 
Master answered, I know you not. I could not recognize 
you as my Bride. 

In view of this the Lord exhorts that his consecrated 
followers of the Church or Virgin class be constantly 
on the alert, because they know neither the day 
nor the hour of the Master's coming and of the invitation 
to go in to the wedding. The parable shows, however, 
that although the time of the Master's coming could not 
be known in the past, nevertheless, it would be known to 
all of the Virgin class "in due time." It will be announced, 
as indicated in the cry. The cry will be so 
loud that all of the Virgins will hear it, even though 
the world will have no knowledge of it. The Master 
merely wished us to understand that the great event would 
not be foretold in advance. 

The parable does not show how the foolish Virgins, 
excluded from the wedding and from membership in the 
Bride class, will be treated. Other Scriptures, however, 
show that this foolish virgin class will share with the 
world in a great time of trouble, which will then come 
to every nation. In that time of trouble these foolish virgins 
will suffer severely and "Wash their robes and make 
them white in the blood of the Lamb," and thereafter be 
accounted worthy to "serve God in his Temple," though 
not worthy to be of the Temple. They will be accounted 
worthy to serve before the Throne, though not worthy to 



sit in the Throne. They will be accounted worthy to 
have palms of victory, but not be accounted worthy of 
crowns of glory. The lesson to God's people is to Awake, 
to hearken, to have our lamps, the Word of God, trimmed 
and burning, and to have oil, the holy Spirit, in our vessels 
—to be living in an attitude of full consecration to 
God.-Rev. 7:9,14,15. 

We see the marriage splendor, 

Within the open door; 
We know that those who enter 

Are blest for evermore; 
We see our King, more lovely 

Than all the sons of men; 
We haste, because that door, once shut, 

Will never ope again. 



R4693 : page 313 

THE RECKONING HOUR 

-MATTHEW 25:14-30.-OCTOBER 9.- 

Golden Text— "His Lord said unto him, Well done, thou good 
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, 
I will make thee ruler over many things; 
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." 

THIS study follows the one of last week. It 

also illustrates the fact that Messiah at his 

Second Advent, before appearing to the 

world in power and great glory and in the 

time of trouble, will be present amongst his 

consecrated people and many of them will 

know of his parousia, or "presence," in this 

time. He will do amongst them a judging 

work— deciding their rewards in proportion 

to their faithfulness. It is well that 

we keep in memory the difference between the parable 

of the pounds and the parable of the talents. Both represented 

money. But a talent is sixty times as valuable 

as a pound. In the parable of the pound, each servant 

got one pound, but in the parable of the talents the numbers 

given varied. In some respects all of God's people 

have one common footing and common privilege of service, 

as represented by the pound. In another respect 

their opportunities, privileges and advantages vary, as 

represented in the present study, the parable of the talents. 

This is another parable of the Kingdom. The Great 
Teacher himself went into the far country, even heaven; 
but before departing he delivered unto his servants 
certain blessings, privileges, opportunities— "to 
each according to his several abilities." The beginning 
of this parable was in the days of the 



Apostles when Jesus ascended up on high and at 
Pentecost shed forth in the Father's name the holy 
Spirit, communicating a blessing upon each one of his 
followers, as represented in the talents and opportunities 
of each follower. All through this Gospel Age these 
servants have been making more or less use of their privileges 
and more or less wisely exercising themselves to 
serve the Master. Some traded with their talents, or used 
them in preaching, teaching, etc. And others hid them in 
the earth, perhaps under cares and responsibilities. After 
a long time the Lord of these servants cometh and reckoneth 
with them. This long time is the Gospel Age, and 
the presence of the King in the end of the Age to hear the 
report of his servants and to reward them represents the 
parousia (or presence) of Messiah and his testing, sifting 
work in his Church. We should distinctly note that 
this testing and proving is not of the world, for Christ 
never recognized any as his servants, except the consecrated. 
Many Christian people believe that we are now 
in the time when the servants of the Lord are rendering 

R4693 : page 314 

up their accounts, and when he is saying to some, "Well 
done, good and faithful servant; enter into the joys of 
thy Lord," and when he is saying to others, "Thou 
wicked and slothful servant. .take ye away, 
therefore, the talent from him, and give it unto him that 
hath the ten talents." But all of this testing and rewarding 
of the servants of Christ is manifestly prior to any outward 
manifestation of the King in his glory, because the 
worthy ones are to share with the Master in his glorious 
manifestation and this testing must demonstrate the 
worthy ones, in advance of the revelation in glory. 

TO RULE OVER EARTH'S CITIES 

The one who had received five talents and used them 
wisely, energetically, faithfully, loyally, doubled them and 
was invited to share in the Master's joy and glory. His 
reward would be to sit as a ruler of many. In other 
words, the service of the present life is but an insignificant 
one in comparison to the glorious service which 
awaits the Lord's faithful people in the future— when 
they shall sit with Messiah in his Throne and, as kings 
and priests, bless and instruct and uplift and control 
Israel and all the nations of the world. The approval of 
the one who was given two talents and who was equally 
faithful, was in equally kind and benevolent terms. He 
also was a good and faithful servant over a few things; 
he also would be set as a ruler over many things; he also 
might enter into the joy of his Lord. The servant who 
failed to use his talent was branded as wicked and slothful. 
He knew in advance that the talent was given him 
for use and because he had professed to be a faithful 
servant. His failure to use the talent proved him disloyal, 



unfaithful. It was, therefore, taken away from him. 
It is not for us to presume to say that the Lord will 
have no blessing whatever for that unfaithful servant. 
He was a servant all the time. He respected 
the talent. He did not lose it. But he did not use it 
properly. He seems to represent a very similar class to 

R4694: page 314 

the one described in our study of a week ago as the foolish 
virgins. This class will fail to get into the glories of 
the Kingdom, but will surely get into the time of trouble 
and its outer darkness, disappointment and chagrin, with 
which this Age will end and the New Age be ushered in. 
The Lord grant that this lesson may help some of 
his consecrated servants to be more faithful, more 
careful, in the use of their consecrated talents, that they 
may glorify the Lord and hear his "Well done" in the 
end! 

One difficulty with many of us in the past has been 
fear of the Master. We should have gotten better acquainted 
with him. We should have learned more respecting 
his real, true character and his purposes. If now 
the eyes of our understanding are opening, if now we 
are seeing the beauty of our talents and privileges of 
service as never before, let us quickly dig the talent out 
and wash it free from all soil of the earth and use it 
earnestly, zealously, vigorously, for the praise of our 
King, redeeming the time, knowing that the days are 
unfavorable.

THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS 

--MATTHEW 25:31-46.-OCTOBER 16.- 

Golden Text— "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of 
the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

PREVIOUS studies have pointed us to the 

Kingdom and incited the Lord's people to 

strive to become members thereof— kings 

and priests unto God in association with the 

Redeemer. Today's study tells of the Kingdom, 

but from another standpoint. It explains 

the work of the Kingdom after it shall 

have been set up— after Messiah at his Second 

Advent shall have gathered his "jewels" 

to constitute his Bride class— after these 

shall be with him in the Throne of his glory— after he 

shall have taken unto himself his great power and shall 

have begun his Messianic reign of righteousness "under 

the whole heavens." It is important in every study of the 



Scriptures that we recognize the Divine Plan as a whole 
and properly locate the teaching of each parable. 

We know that the parable of the sheep and the goats 
belongs not to this Age, but to the coming Age of Messiah's 
glorious reign, because the introduction declares 
this, saying, "When the Son of man shall come in his 
glory and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit 
upon the Throne of his glory, and before him shall be 
gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from 
another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." 
Those sheep and goats will not include the Church, to 
whom the promise is, "When he shall appear, we also 
shall appear with him in glory"— sharing his Throne. 

The salvation of the Church will be finished before the 
salvation of the world will begin. Today's study pictures 
the salvation of the world, showing us how every member 
of Adam's race will be on trial during the reign of Messiah 
and, by his obedience or disobedience to the light and 
knowledge then prevailing, he will be deciding his own 
everlasting future, either as a sheep or as a goat. It will 
require the entire one thousand years of Messiah's reign 
to complete the testing and separating work. 

THE WICKED NOT TO BE PRESERVED 

All then obedient will be recognized as children of God 
and brethren. All the disobedient will be reckoned as 
children of the Adversary and worthy to share his fate, 
because, under favorable conditions, they were rebellious. 
Such shall be destroyed with Satan in the Second Death, 
which is symbolically represented as fire, because fire is 
always destructive, never preservative. On the contrary, 
the sheep class at the conclusion of Messiah's reign will 
have reached perfection, the image and likeness of God, 
on the human plane. These will be invited to become the 
kings of earth under the Divine supervision— even as was 
Adam in his original perfection— crowned with glory and 
honor and set over the earthly creation.— Psalm 8:3-5. 

The terms and conditions which will test and determine 
who will be sheep and who will be goats, who will be 
obedient or disobedient to the Divine regulations, will be 
mercy, kindness, love. The loving and sympathetic 
character is the only one which God purposes 
shall have eternal life, either on the heavenly 
or on the earthly plane— all having either the 
wolfish or devilish character, or even the goat 
character— of waywardness and unsubmissiveness, will be 
accounted unworthy of any further blessing after the 
close of the reign of Messiah. The testing then will not 
be as to believing or disbelieving, striving to do well or 
not striving to do well. The Church is dealt with now 
along such lines. God's dealings with us make allowances 
for our unwilling imperfections. But in the trial 
of the world in the future every man shall be tried according 
to his work, not according to his faith. In that 
time knowledge will have practically supplanted faith; 



R4695 : page 315 

hence faith will have no special rewards. Works will 
then have the rewards, and each member of the race will 
be expected to strive for perfect works and to be assistants 
of the Great King Emmanuel and his Bride, the 
Church on the spirit plane. Mankind will be enabled gradually 
to attain such perfection of mind and of body as will 
make perfect works possible. At the conclusion of the 
Millennial Age perfect works only will be rewarded. 

REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 

We have already referred to the rewards that will be 
granted to the "sheep" class at the close of Messiah's 
Kingdom— they will enter into life eternal and become 
possessors of the earthly Kingdom originally given to 
Adam, but lost through disobedience, and redeemed by 
the sacrifice of Jesus and restored by his Messianic reign, 
for which we pray, "Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done 
on earth as in heaven." 

As for the "goat" class, we have already intimated that 
their punishment will consist of destruction in fire, or destruction 
everlasting, the Second Death— the destruction 
which God has already determined for Satan and all who 
are his messengers and servants, after the manner of 
this goat class— because, with all the favorable opportunities, 
they failed to develop such characters as God 
could reward with life everlasting. The contrast is emphasized 
in the last verse of the study. These (the goat 
class) shall go away into eternal punishment; but the 
righteous, the sheep class, into eternal life. The contrast 
is perfect. The one gets life to all eternity. The other 
gets the specified punishment of destruction to all eternity. 
The Greek word here translated punishment is 
kolasin, which signifies restraint, cutting off— in this case 
cutting off from life— Second Death. "The wages (punishment) 
of sin is death." 

Some one has well said:— 
"Sow a thought and you reap an act; 
Sow an act and you reap a habit; 
Sow a habit and you reap a character; 
Sow a character and you reap a destiny." 

The Divine intention as respects the salvation of this 
Gospel Age and the salvation of the world during the 
coming Age is that only such as develop the God-like 
character shall be permitted to enjoy Divine favor to all 
eternity. God has determined that the time shall come 
when there shall be no more sighing, no more crying, no 
more dying; but instead, every creature in heaven and in 
earth and under the earth shall be heard praising God and 
the Lamb.

THE MARK OF PERFECT LOVE 

Oh Lord, we thank thee thou hast set 

A Mark of perfect love 
Which we must reach ere we can win 

Approval from above. 

For, in the reaching of that Mark, 

Our characters are built, 
Which thou requirest of all those 

Whom Christ has freed from guilt. 

We consecrate to follow him 

Along the "narrow way"; 
And so we strive to overcome, 

And grow, from day to day. 

And "perfect love"— what does it mean? 

Must we attain thereto? 
And actually love, and perfectly, 

Our God and brother true? 

E'en so, we actually must love 

Our Father, first and best, 
And love our "Elder Brother," as 

In him we find true rest. 

And then our enemies we love; 

We seek to do them good! 
We ever try to render them 

The services we should. 

Ah yes, 'tis actual, perfect love 

We truly must attain; 
But, oh, how often do we fail! 

And failure gives us pain— 

Because this creature of pure love 

In sin-racked body lives; 
But, praise his name, our Advocate 

His loving service gives. 

So, perfect will and perfect love 
Are handicapped till we 

In his own likeness shall awake- 
Like him for e'er to be! F. A. R.

THIS LOOKS REASONABLE 
DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 



WHILE reading the article in May 1 TOWER, 

entitled "The Binding of the Strong Man," 

certain further conclusions presented themselves 

to my mind; but they were of such a 

startling character that I have refrained 

from mentioning them to a single soul, as 

I would not for all the world wish to promulgate 

an idea that had any measure of 

error in it. However, the more I have 

thought over it the more has it impressed 

me as correct. It is herewith submitted for your consideration. 

If you can discern anything unscriptural in it 

I shall drop the matter altogether, as it is far better to 

suppress a questionable truth than run the risk of propagating 

a possible error. 

The Lord has permitted the Church in these last times 
to be blessed with such an abundance that it makes us 
tremble lest we might be instrumental in the circulation 
of some one of the many forms of unscriptural teaching, 
thus assisting in marring in our own mind, and in the 
minds of others, the beautiful harmony of the Divine 
Plan. How the Truth has made us love our Lord, 
and how grievous it would be if we were to find that in 
any way we have encouraged that which did not properly 
represent him ! 

The article referred to suggests the thought that just 
as there is a Christ company, the Church, the Body of 
Christ, and then an individual Christ, who is the Head 
of the Body, even Jesus, so likewise there is a Satanic 
company, a System over which the Devil is head, as 
well as the individual Satan, Beelzebub, the "Chief of 
Devils." 

In that article you remind us that during the last 
thirty-five years there has been considerable evidence that 
a work of restraint has been going on in this great "system 
of which Satan has stood as the representative or 
head." You there point out how much evidence we have 
of the gradual binding of this system of things in the 
Prohibition movement, and we saw how the light along 
all lines was the agency being used of the Lord in the 
accomplishment of this binding or restraining of some 

R4695 : page 316 

of the things connected with the evil system. However, 
you made it plain that you did not refer to the binding of 
the individual Devil, but to the binding of the satanic 
organization. 

But right here I thought of the words of our Lord 
in Matthew 12:29, to which your article also refers, 
"How can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil 
his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then 
he will spoil his house." According to this, if the Lord 
were to bind the Strong Man, Satan, before he began to 
spoil his house, and if we see reason to believe that the 
house is being spoiled already, then must we not conclude 



that the personal Devil has been bound for some 
time? May it not be that part of the work accomplished 
by our invisibly present Master between 1874 and 1878 
was the binding of the Wicked One? One of our Lord's 
first experiences after his baptism 1 800 years ago was 
with Satan, and how likely that one of his first experiences 
at his second coming would be with the same Adversary! 

If the question is asked, Where, then, if Satan is now 
bound, do all our temptations come from? I answer, 
from the fallen spirits who were once under the control 
of Satan. For some cause, possibly the fact that he had 
been a being of a higher order than they, Lucifer appears 
to have had power over the other angels that had 
fallen, which they could not successfully resist; so if 
they were ever to be brought back into harmony with 
God it would be necessary for them to be set free from 
the bondage they were in to their leader, Satan. 

In Hebrews 1:6, we find that all the other translations 
give quite a different thought from that in the King 
James translation; even the margin of the authorized 
version gives the correct thought. The Revised Version 
says, "And when he again bringeth in the First-Born 
into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God 
worship him." This would, to my mind, seem to imply 
that when our Lord would come into the world the second 
time, one of the things he purposes is to give the 
fallen angels a chance to prove whether they are willing 
to become angels of God once more, and one of the ways 
whereby they might demonstrate that they are sick and 
tired of the service of the Devil is to acknowledge the 
authority of the One who has now returned to be King 
of earth, by worshipping and obeying him. On the contrary, 
those of them who would continue in sympathy 
with the evil principles of their wicked master, would 
simply use the increased liberty that would come to them 
through the binding of Satan, to introduce new forms 
of wickedness. 

During the ages in which they served Satan, no doubt 
many wicked ideas apart from their leader occurred to 
them, but as he had his own idea of how his kingdom 
should be run, they were not allowed to have their own 
way. But now Satan's restraint has given them the occasion 
wished for, and would account for the great diversity 
of spiritualistic phenomena, compared with that of 
former times. 

I cannot see how the fallen angels could have a fair 
trial as long as Satan was at liberty to coerce them to do 
his bidding, as seems to have been the case in the past. 

If Satan is now bound, it would also teach another 
lesson: Many have the idea that in order to bring all 
the iniquity in the world to an end, it is merely necessary 
to bind the great Author of Sin, when things would 
naturally readjust themselves in harmony with the will 
of God. But the fact that after the binding of the Evil 
One things would in some respects be even worse than 
they were before, resulting in the worst time of trouble 



that had ever been, would prove to all the universe that 
sin is not merely such an awful thing because Satan was 
here to direct things, but that the real cause of the trouble 
was sin, whether there was an archangel behind it, or 
one of the lower order of angels, or simply a man; that 
sin is the terror, with Satan or without him; that sin is 
the cursed thing. 

The last point to be mentioned is this: If Satan was 
bound about 1874, and if the period of his restraint is 
also to be a thousand years, he would be due to be set at 
liberty about 2874. On the other hand, a thousand years 
from 1915, when the world will have been fully turned 
over to Christ, will bring us to 2915, when the world will 
have been fully turned over to the Father. This would 
allow a period of about forty years as the "little season" 
when Satan is to bring upon the world the great and 
final test. But if the binding of Satan is to be reckoned 
from 1915 it would be difficult to see where the little 
season, "when the thousand years were finished," would 
come in. From this standpoint these various Scriptures 
would be equally applicable to the individual Satan, and 
also to the satanic system. 

Now, dear Brother, if you have anything that even 
half-way looks like proof that I am wrong in these suggestions, 
I think it would be better for me to drop it altogether, 
as far as presenting these things to others is concerned, 
as we cannot afford to risk stumbling our brethren 
with a doubtful interpretation. 

Praying the Lord's continued direction in all your affairs, 
as you seek to pour out the little strength and time 
that remain to you, in the service of the Lord of the 
Harvest, I remain, 

Your Brother and servant in the cause which seeks the 
Glory of our Lord, BENJ. H. BARTON.

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
MOSES AND THE LAW COVENANT 

Question.— Was Moses out from under Adamic 
Condemnation? 

Answer.— If he was a member of the Jewish nation 
then he was in this special covenant-relationship with God. 
Adam, when he sinned, lost his covenant standing with 
God and was sentenced to death. God made a new arrangement 
with the Seed of Abraham, that he would enter 
into a Covenant with them as though they were perfect; 
and to this end Moses became their mediator. We have 
every reason to suppose that Moses was also a participator 
in the arrangement as well as being the mediator of 
it. So we suppose that Moses was under the Law the 
same as were his successors, and this Covenant, by its 



arrangement year by year continually, not only put them, 

at the first, in this condition of typical justification or 

covenant-relationship with God, but it gave them a whole 

year of that favorable condition; and only at the end of 

the year, when the period for which the sacrifice had been 

offered had lapsed, were they no longer in covenant-relationship 

with God. Then they put on sackcloth and ashes 

and, like the remainder of the world, they were sinners, 

under condemnation, but under more condemnation than 

the rest of the world because they had the additional 

condemnation of the Law. 

We understand, then, that if Moses could have kept 
the Law under that Covenant, God would have been 
bound to give him eternal life according to the promise— 

R4696 : page 317 

"He that doeth these things shall live by them." God did 
not say anything about Christ or believing in Christ or 
anything of that kind; merely, he that doeth these things 
shall have eternal life by doing them. And so we think 
that this promise applied to Moses and all the Israelites 
under the Law, and still applies to the Jews. And we believe 
God would give eternal life to anyone who could do 
those things perfectly, but this offer was made only to 
the Jews. They were out from Adamic condemnation 
in that tentative sense; not that they had escaped, for 
since they still bore unchanged the same imperfections as 
the remainder of the children of Adam, they could not 
do what they wished to do; as the Apostle says, "We 
cannot do the things that we would." So they had a 
condemnation as a people which other nations did not 
have. Adam, individually, had been sentenced to death. 
His children did not have, individually, that condemnation. 
They were born in "prison"— in this death condition. 
But in the case of the Jews, God treated them as though 
they had been separated from the remainder of the world. 

It was as if they had said, "We did not do anything 
wrong, Lord; why do you not give us a chance?" 

"I will give you a chance; I will give you my Law 
to keep." 

"What will you give us if we keep your Law 
perfectly?" 

"I will give you eternal life." 

"We will keep it. We agree to keep your Law, and 
you agree to give us life." So, then, these children of 
Adam, the Jews, who, like the rest of the world, were 
not on individual trial previously, and had not, therefore, 
been sentenced as individuals, but were merely sharing the 
effect of Adam's condemnation— all these Jews were now 
put on trial for life, and when they failed it meant a 
special penalty upon them, because they now had an individual 
trial and failed. Therefore, we see that it was 
necessary that the Jew, under this second condemnation, 
or this individual trial and individual condemnation, 
should all be under Moses as the Mediator, so that Christ 



could take the place of this Mediator and effect something 
for that nation. Moses was merely typical of the 
better Mediator. Therefore, since they were in that 
Mediator, who was only a type of Christ, God was merely 
showing to them in a typical way what he will do for 
them by and by, when Christ will be Mediator of their 
New (Law) Covenant.— Jer. 31:31. 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH 

Question.— Will any of the Gentiles be justified by 
faith during the Millennial Age? 

Answer.— We understand that justification by faith 
applies to the present age and to our salvation— the 
Church's salvation— which is called "salvation by faith" 
in contradistinction to the salvation that was offered to 
the Jews in their Age, the salvation by works, under the 
Law Covenant, and also in contrast with the salvation 
that will be offered to the Jews and to the world in the 
next Age, which will be a salvation by works under the 
New (Law) Covenant. In other words, this Gospel Age 
is the only Age in which faith takes the place of perfection. 
It is true, of course, that no Jew could have been 
justified before God by keeping the Law Covenant unless 
he had believed in God; and it is equally true that no one 
will be justified under the New Covenant arrangement 
except he believe in God and is in harmony with the arrangements 
that will then be open to all. However, this 
will not make it a faith-salvation, a salvation by faith, 
but a salvation by works— the works of the Law. 

The works of the Law were unable to save the Jews 
during the Jewish dispensation because they could not 
keep the Law, and because there was no arrangement 
made through an efficient mediator to lift them up out 
of their degradation, but this arrangement has been made 
future for all Israel and all who will come in under this 
arrangement in the Millennial Age. They will be enabled 
to perform the works. They will be helped out of 
their degradation. So we read in Revelation that the sea 
will give up her dead, the grave will give up the dead 
that are in it, and that they shall all stand before the 
great white throne during the Millennial Age, and shall 
all be judged out of the things written in the book; 
according to their works shall they be judged, then. The 
distinctive statement made regarding us now is that it is 
not according to our works that we are judged, but according 
to our faith. So, then, there will be faith and 
works in the Millennial Age, and there are faith and 
works in this Gospel Age; but the faith of the Millennial 
Age will be less meritorious in proportion because everything 
will be very plain and easy to believe, and hence it 
will not be the faith that will be specially rewarded then, 
but the works. In this Age faith takes the most important 
place, and we are not rewarded according to our 



works, for we have none to reward. But it is the faith 
that will be rewarded. 

Faith and works apply to both ages, but in the one 
age it is the faith that is rewarded, and in the other the 
works will be rewarded. In the one, faith is the standard 
or test of whether one is worthy or unworthy and 
in the other works will be the standard or test of whether 
one is worthy or unworthy of eternal life. 

Galatians 3:8 seems very particularly to show that the 
reference is to the Gentiles who are justified through 
faith and not by works; hence, we understand that this 
text applies to the Gospel Age in the sense that God foresaw 
that during this Gospel Age he would justify certain 
of the Gentiles through faith, just as he intended also to 
justify some of the Jews through faith. The Gentiles 
never were under the Law of works, but are accepted 
under the Gospel arrangement, by faith. 



HOW TO DETERMINE THE LORD'S WILL 

Question.— Suppose some one has in mind an undertaking 
which he believes is of the Lord's leading, and yet 
others who are as consecrated to the Lord as himself, 
seem to think it may not be of the Lord's leading, is 
there any way whereby he can assure himself that he is 
right? 

Answer.— We think that it is a good rule, when one is 
uncertain as to what is the right course, to simply stand 
still and wait, if the matter can be dealt with in that way. 
But if it is a matter that cannot be delayed but must be 
determined at once, it would not do to stand still; but it 
would be well in many instances to merely stand and 
wait. 

For instance, a gentleman asked us as to whether he 
should build a house or not. We were not hasty in giving 
him advice, and he urged us to tell him our thought. 
After he had told us all the conditions, we advised him 
not to build, and gave our reasons. We did not attempt to 
urge our views upon him at all, but left them there. It 
is well for us to remember not to give too much concern 
about things that are not in our hands to decide; we 
would thus save ourselves a deal of trouble. In everything, 
however, that is in our hands to decide, we should 
use a great deal of care and judgment and try to find out 
the Lord's will in the matter. 

In the case of people having different opinions about 

R4696 : page 318 

things, we think it well for one, if the responsibility rests 
with him, to hear what others may have to say and then 
consider the matter with as much wisdom and judgment 
as possible, and proceed to act according to his best 
judgment, taking into consideration the reasons advanced 



by his friends, bearing in mind, however, that the 
responsibility of decision is with himself. 



FAITH THE GIFT OF GOD 

Question.— Is faith the gift of God? 

Answer.— "By grace are ye saved through faith, and 
that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." The Apostle 
seems to intimate that grace is God's favor; in fact, 
the word "grace" has the signification of gift, or that 
which is favor. Our salvation is of Divine favor— not of 
any necessity on God's part, not because Justice required 
it, not because anyone could have demanded it from him, 
but it is his own merciful, gracious provision, and this 
salvation in our case is through faith. And the faith is 
not of ourselves, as a matter of course. Hence we think 
that when the Apostle says "it is not of ourselves," he 
must refer to faith. However, faith, in a very important 
sense, is of the individual; we are urged to "have faith 
unto God." One cannot have faith for another. The individual 
must exercise his own faith in God; and yet in 
this text we are told that our faith is of God. 

R4697 : page 318 

In what sense could this be of God? We answer 
that it is of God in the sense that every good and every 
perfect gift comes down from the Father. Our faith 
must have a foundation, must have a basis. We must 
have knowledge of a matter in order to have faith in it. 
We have knowledge of God, and this knowledge which is 
granted us as a grace or favor brings us to the place 
where we are enabled to exercise the faith. The faith in 
a great measure rests upon the knowledge. The knowledge 
shows us God's character; the Divine Revelation 
makes known to us certain facts respecting God's purposes, 
and we see the purposes thus outlined to be in 
harmony with the character of God, and this enables one 
to believe the promises; and believing them, we are enabled 
to act upon them; and this is faith. 

So, then, our faith, while it is of ourselves in the sense 
that we must exercise it, is of God in the sense that he 
supplies the necessary elements from which that faith 
is to be compounded. 



IS THE CHURCH A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD NOW? 

Question.— Is the Church in the flesh a royal 
priesthood? 

Answer.— We recognize that we are not a royal priesthood, 
in the full sense of the word, yet, because we are not 
yet certain that we shall be in the priesthood finally. We 



must first make our calling and election sure. 

It will have to be determined whether we shall be in 
the "Little Flock" or "Great Company"— whether Priests 
or Levites— or whether we shall be worthy of life at all. 
Since this matter, then, is in process of determination and 
will not be fully settled until our death, it follows that 
we are not in the fullest sense of the word officiating 
priests, but candidates for this priesthood, and temporarily 
acknowledged as priests and counted as priests- 
just as some time you might meet a gentleman who had 
been nominated for Governor. By way of compliment 
you might say, "Good morning, Governor." He is not 
really a Governor yet. That will be determined by the 
election, but before he is elected it might be proper or 
courteous to call him Governor. And so with us. We 
hope we shall make our calling and election sure; that we 
shall be of that royal priesthood in the fullest sense, and 
in one sense we are now members in the Body, in that we 
have already received a begetting of the Spirit, acknowledgment 
of the Lord as ambassadors of God. This is an 
acknowledgment in one sense of the word of our priestly 
office, for these priests are "ambassadors," and to whatever 
extent we are conducting ourselves as ambassadors 
of God, to that extent we are priests of God— of the probationary 
kind, and not fully of the Melchisedec kind, 
which we shall be when our change shall come and we 
shall be like our Lord.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 
QUARTERLY REPORTS DESIRED 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

We take this opportunity of advising you of the progress of 
the evangelistic services the Cleveland, O., class is engaged in. 

We have held four meetings in Chardon; the first had an 
attendance of thirty, and this with opposition from a political 
meeting held in the church; the number at our service exceeded 
the church service. The next Sunday there were 
thirty persons present again, the third Sunday fifteen, and the 
fourth Sunday ten. An immense amount of literature was 
taken, and the ten seemed to be interested enough to form 
a class. They are now reading the first volume. It was 
thought advisable that they thus continue for a short time, 
when organization will be taken into consideration. 

Upon receipt of a letter in a roundabout way from Lorain, 
twelve consecrated children of God who had left the Salvation 
Army, because of methods of which they could not approve, 
were formed into a class, and are meeting regularly 
every Sunday. Some sixteen volumes having been purchased 
since their first meeting. We are furnishing a leader every 
Sunday. 



On July 24 we held a public meeting in Clyde, O., at 
the direction of the Bellevue Ecclesia, where about fifty were 
present. The Bellevue friends have been very zealous this 
summer, and no doubt their efforts are showing some fruit. 
We have in view two or three one-day meetings, after which 
we again purpose holding three or four meetings in towns 
where the expenditures will justify the efforts. 

We would appreciate any suggestions from you that you 
might see fit to make. We are anxious for all the service that 
we can undertake. 

Yours in Service, 

INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS OF CLEVELAND. 

IN REPLY 

DEAR BRETHREN:- 

I accept the above as a Quarterly Report. It is excellent. 
The classes which have a surplus of energy and talent surely 
do well to employ it thus in nearby places. May the Lord's 
blessing continue richly with you as a class and individually, 
and upon your labors in the "harvest" field. 

I take this opportunity to request Quarterly Reports from 
all the classes which have elected me their Pastor. To fulfil 
the pastoral office I must look specially after the interests of 
these classes— even though I know not how I can really do 
more for them than I now endeavor to do for all. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

I feel impelled to write you a word of encouragement and 
endorsement. In WATCH TOWER issue of Sept. 15 there is 
an article captioned, "Is the reading of SCRIPTURE STUDIES 
Bible study?" which I read with great pleasure; and in it I 
note your defense of the Bible and your humility and meekness. 
My answer to the question would be "Yes, the reading 
of SCRIPTURE STUDIES is Bible study, for who of us ever understood 
the Old or New Testament till we, by God's goodness, 
through your loving, zealous and Christlike effort, came 
in contact with these STUDIES?" 

Those of us who were trained for the ministry studied 
everything and anything but the Bible. What some of us did, 
at best, was to memorize as much of the good Book as we 
could, but neither bishops, nor D.D.'s, nor B.D.'s, nor any 
other understood the Book, and consequently could not help 
the weaker ones. 

You have spoken the truth; for I remember when I served 
"Ism," I honestly came to the conclusion that I was unfit to be 
in that position as a teacher of God's Word when I was practically 

page 319 

unable to give a clear, definite and reasonable answer 
to one of the members of the congregation who asked a 
Biblical question; and in substance I said, "I will stop any 
endeavor to teach others until I know what I believe, what 



to teach and how to teach it." And it was not many days after 
this decision that our Father apprehended me through these 
STUDIES, and I apprehended his Truth. 

God bless you! War a good warfare, be courageous and 
may the blessings in Numbers 6:24-26 be yours until the end 
of your pilgrimage. 

I am yours fraternally, J. J. HARRIS. 



DEAR BRETHREN:- 

By an oversight, or rather by a misunderstanding as to 
who should send in the request for Pilgrim service, we have 
not been having the calls we expected, and did not know 
where the trouble was till your letter to us of Sept. 3. Then 
we found that one Brother who was to send in the request 
did not so understand it, and this we learned when the class 
met. Most assuredly we want a Pilgrim Brother every time 
we can get him, and we want you to plan for us a two-days' 
visit also each time. This we have always had, and want the 
same if you can let us have so much of service without in 
any way taking service from some other class. We shall 
gladly have Brother Hall with us. He was with us on one 
other occasion for two days, and we greatly enjoyed his visit. 
Our class is growing in the knowledge of the Truth daily, 
and we want every help we can get. 

Yours in our dear Redeemer, CHAS. BOAZ, M.D. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Greetings from the Church at Lancaster to you, our beloved 
Pastor, through whom the Lord has called and made 
us to sit down at his table and through whom he has served 
us with "meat in due season." 

We rejoice with you in the increased light that is shining 
so brightly on the various features of the Divine Plan (the 
sin-offering, the covenants, etc.). We have been led and fed, 
nourished and cherished of the Lord by the precious truths 
which he has brought to us through you, his servant, until 
we are caused to exclaim with Brother Paul, "Oh the depth 
of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,... 
for who hath known the mind of the Lord or who has been his 
counsellor?" 

We also recognize with you the evil day in which we are 
living and the increased powers of evil in various directions, 
and herewith send the names of those who have sufficiently 
realized this to make the Vow their own unto the 
Lord. And as was suggested by you, that all the names of 
those in the Lancaster class who have taken the Vow be sent 
to you together, we take this opportunity to do so. Those 
having previously sent in their names are listed separately. 

We earnestly request to be remembered at the throne of 
heavenly grace that we might faithfully keep both the spirit 
and the letter of the Vow until we are all brought face to 
face with him who died for us and bought us with his own 



precious blood. 
Yours in the love and service of our King, 

SIGNED BY FORTY-FIVE. 

IN REPLY 

BELOVED IN THE LORD:- 

I acknowledge your letter of the 16th inst, and assure 
you that its words of love and fellowship in our dear Lord 
are highly appreciated and fully reciprocated. 

I am also refreshed through this token of your confidence, 
prizing the approval of the fellow-members in the Body 
next to that of the gracious heavenly Father and our dear 
Lord himself. 

I note, with gratification, that so many of the Lancaster 
Class have, in acknowledgment of all the benefits which they 
have received from the Lord, paid their vows to him in the 
presence of all the people. It is surely strengthening to note 
the names of the twenty-five friends who have more recently 
paid their vows to the Lord, in addition to the twenty who 
did so earlier and who previously notified us. 

May each of us be more and more diligent to hold our 
"Head" purely; that we may grow more and more into him 
and at his revelation be given a seat with him on his throne.

<p><span class="font2">1949 YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S witnesses are God’s ministers to the nations and peoples of the world. The Sovereign Ruler of the universe has always had ministers in the earth representing his cause. His purposes must be proclaimed. The prophet Isaiah says, “But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God.” (Isa. 61: 6, A.S.V.) David also wrote, “Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.” (Ps. 103:21, A.&gt;S'.7.) The apostle Paul knew his responsibility as a representative of Jehovah, for he declared, “I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God.” (Rom. 15:16, A.S.V.) Paul was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as was Christ Jesus, who showed the manner of work that was to be done by God’s ministers. “Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom . . . among the people.” (Matt. 4:23, A.S.V.) The historical record reveals that Jehovah has had his ministers keep alive the big issue of, Who is the Supreme One? and who will recognize his supremacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unequivocal answer is that Jehovah is the only true God of all the universe; the Creator of heaven and earth; the Great Spirit; the great intelligent, active Personage, invisible to man; he who has made himself discernible to man by his wondrous and marvelous works of creation—he is the Supreme One. There are, however, very few on the earth who recognize and acknowledge his supremacy. Little do they</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">realize that “blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah”.—Psalm 33:12, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it not true that the big issue in the minds of all the “great men” of the nations is, “Who shall rule”? Will it be the United Nations organization? Will it be some totalitarian power? or will it be some bloc of nations that will get control of this earth? These questions trouble the minds of all of the groaning creation. Every creature in the earth is ruled and influenced by some power. All these ruling influences which control individuals can be classified under three main headings. The influential ruling power is either religious or political or commercial. These Big Three are determined to control the lives of all the peoples in the world. Some religious rulers even go so far as to claim control of persons after death. These three powers are constantly vying for positions of rulership. Occasionally they co-operate, but just as often they will stab one another in the back if it proves to be to their advantage. All three have identical aims: Power! Influence! Supremacy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The recorded rise and fall of nations under the control of religion, politics and big business make up our history books. Often the cause for change in government has been the dissatisfaction of the people with their rulers, necessitating the bringing forth of a new political power to take charge. When this happens it does not take long for religion and big business to get in the saddle with the new political party. A more frequent reason for change in rulership is the desire of a strong power to take in all the territories within reach, seeking greater domination or even world rule. There has been a constant struggle between the nations for generations and centuries, as long as man can remember and as far back as recorded history chronicles the struggle. Why cannot men get along in peace? Why cannot they get rid of war and its evils? First of all, man does not acknowledge God as supreme. He refuses to follow Jehovah’s counsel and is so proud of his own achievements that he has become blinded in his lust for power. Man does not love his neighbor as he loves himself; otherwise he would let his fellow man live and try to help him. Man’s activity in all parts of the earth shows he is a selfish creature, and he is led by selfish rulers. Jesus said concerning the rulers in his day, “they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.”—Matt. 15:14, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One living in the more civilized nations of the world where the children get an education knows of the efforts of the people to better their conditions and how great advances have been brought about in housing, sanitation, communication, travel, and all the sciences. But even in such countries where advance in knowledge has been great, man has not been able to live above his selfish way. It should be clear to everyone that man is born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and, no matter how great his achievements, even to the extent of controlling the atom, he uses his great power and knowledge selfishly to kill and destroy his fellow man. What ruler on earth has the right to say that a man or group of men, even though it be the rulers, has the right to say that millions of people can be blotted off of the face of the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men have assumed such rights, taking to themselves such power, and in a few short years of war whole cities have been destroyed along with their civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within this present generation two great world wars have swept the earth. This gives us reason to change the maps in the geography books. The masses did not want the change; it was the desire of some individuals who wanted supreme rulership. But the millions of people in various countries of the earth backed up such selfish rulers only to find their own and other countries left in ruin and despair. The first World War was fought to “make the world safe for democracy”; but selfish men would not have it so. Neither the rulers of religion nor the rulers of politics nor the rulers of commerce could make it so, whether through their United Nations organization or any other form of government. They can never bring peace and prosperity and eternal happiness to the peoples who inhabit this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beautifully worded ideas put into charters for all nations to sign will not change the hearts and minds of the people. Written declarations will not remove the many diverse religious organizations that are working against one another: Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, Mohammedan, and hundreds of others. Agreements will not remove the big business monopolies, the cartels, powerful steel industries, shipping combines, influential newspapers, nor stop their all-out fight to get to the top and be supreme. The United Nations Charter will never remove the kings, the prime ministers, the dictators, the presidents nor the men behind the scenes who are grasping for power and world rule. As long as man carries on with his selfish desire to be supreme and to rule and domineer over his fellow man, ignoring God, he will have no success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses as God’s ordained ministers are declaring to the nations and their peoples that now is the time to forsake their evil ways and turn to Jehovah, the Almighty One, for proper instruction in righteousness. David gave wise counsel when he said, ‘‘Now therefore be wise, 0 ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled.”—Ps. 2:10-12, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are the reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses are so busy preaching the good tidings of God’s kingdom and directing the minds of the people to the study of God’s Word, the Bible. There the people can find the truth and can plan a life for themselves based on the principles of truth and righteousness. They need have no part with this old, dying world, but should line up with the “new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”. (2 Pet. 3:13) The Supreme Ruler of the universe will settle the issue without any difficulty when the time comes for a settlement of the controversy as to who shall rule the world. He has not ordained man to rule, either through religious or through political or commercial organizations. He has appointed His Son to do that, and he shall reign until he has put all enemies under his feet, including death, the last enemy to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has permitted men to rule under the “god of this world”, Satan the Devil, until Jehovah chooses to show His supremacy. (2 Cor. 4:4) The scriptures are clear on the point that Satan is the invisible ruler of this present evil world. He is also referred to as “the prince of this world”, and in due time he shall be cast out of his ruling position. (John 12:31; Eph. 2:2) The time to settle the issue of world supremacy is very near, and Revelation, chapter 12, shows us what happens at the world’s end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The issue of supremacy had its beginning in the Garden of Eden after the creation of Adam. Lucifer, who later became Satan the Devil, was made the covering cherub; but after being honored with this exalted position by God, he declared his avowed purpose to become like the Most High himself and set his throne in the sides of the north. Lucifer fell from his lofty position in God’s universal organization because of bringing sin and eventually death into the world. Adam and Eve chose to follow Satan the liar rather than the only true God, Jehovah, their Creator, and it was at that time that the issue was raised: Who shall rule? Jehovah decreed that He would allow Satan to remain as controller of earth’s affairs and as the god of this world so that God could show forth His power in the last days in which we now live.—Ex. 9:16; Rom. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That unhappy day was nearly six thousand years ago, and since then nations have come and gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Groups of people have risen to power and either have chosen or had forced upon them kings, presidents, dictators, premiers, parliaments and senates; but for the people it has only meant strife and war, distress and struggle, because Satan “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them”. (2 Cor. 4:4, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> Despite Satan’s uninterrupted rule, he has failed in his attempt to bring all persons under his domination. Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide have stood aloof to his offers to be a part of this world. They choose to be God’s ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah considers the nations as but a “drop of a bucket, and ... as the small dust of the balance”; and when the time comes for their destruction, he can easily accomplish it. (Isa. 40:15) According to Jehovah’s own word, he has reserved the nations of the earth for destruction, because he classes them as vessels not worthy of existence. The nations are in his hands as soft ‘clay in the potter’s hand’. (Jer. 18:6) As the apostle Paul pointed out, “Hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory?” (Rom. 9:21-23, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> The nations have ignored and refused his Word. They have not acknowledged him as God, and they do not declare his name unto all the nations. Jehovah has no reason or obligation to keep these dishonoring nations in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses, on the other hand, have accepted this responsibility of announcing Jehovah’s supremacy, and each and every one declares: “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” (Ps. 57:9) They do not mean just joining some church and attending once in a while either; they mean being real, active announcers of God’ kingdom, the only hope for the world. They have the same spirit about this preaching work as David had when he said, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I . . . </span><span class="font7">will praise thee yet more and more.” (Ps. 71:14, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> They mean just that—no more, no less—and this 1949 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font7">proves it. They have rejected and will not represent this old world, proclaiming and supporting its schemes, but have chosen to be Jehovah’s witnesses, God’s ordained ministers. Therefore they fearlessly and joyfully announce the incoming new world of righteousness for which Christians have been taught to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” This they will do uncompromisingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people say, “It is no wonder Jehovah’s witnesses are looked upon as undesirables.” But still they are peace-loving people. In every country wherein they reside it is impossible to distinguish them from other people as far as customs and general living habits are concerned. What is it, then, that makes them so peculiar and sets them apart as a group some people want to avoid? What have they done, and what are their current activities? They claim to be God’s ordained ministers, but are they any different from any other so-called religious organization? They certainly are not orthodox. Has it not been said that they are booksellers and magazine distributors? Are not Jehovah’s witnesses in this work because of commercialism? Have not they been called the opposers of all religions ? Have not people said they are Communists ? Fascists? Zionists? These and hundreds of other questions have been asked about them, and Jehovah’s witnesses have been accused of being just such. But all these political groups have denied any support or association with Jehovah’s witnesses and have persecuted them in the countries dominated by these powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The true answer to all of these questions is so simple that it is difficult for people to understand. Individuals who are seeking truth and who have faith in God and his written Word can find out the real answer by some careful Bible study and association with Jehovah’s witnesses. Many such students have changed their minds about these ministers. Simply stated, Jehovah’s witnesses are supporting God’s kingdom as the only hope for men to gain eternal life. Paul said, “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ.” (2 Cor. 5:20) If Jehovah’s witnesses are ambassadors of God’s kingdom, they cannot serve another kingdom, any more than the representative of one of the nations in this world could stand up and speak in favor of another nation and against his own government. He would lose his citizenship and position. Jehovah’s witnesses have entered into a covenant to represent the kingdom of heaven, and they know “covenantbreakers . . . are worthy of death”. (Rom. 1: 31, 32) But they love life! Therefore they will defend, work for, support and preach the kingdom of God. “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. ... for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!” (1 Cor. 9:14-16) Because of taking such an unequivocal stand for God’s kingdom they are hated of all nations. “If ye were of the world, the world would love his owm: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 15:19) Yes, Jehovah’s witnesses are looked upon as undesirables because they preach God’s kingdom, and because of this they are accused of all manner of evil. “Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.”—Matt. 10:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Centuries ago Jehovah inspired men to write books which we now have compiled into one volume called the Bible. These faithful men were servants of God and foretold the good news of God’s kingdom. Paul the apostle was “set apart to declare God’s good news, which he promised long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures”. (Rom. 1:1-3, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.') </span><span class="font7">You can turn to the eleventh chapter of Hebrews and there find a list of men who lived in olden times whom God used in promulgating true worship. They were witnesses of Jehovah, but they w<sup>T</sup>ere not loved by the world. “They were stoned to death, they were tortured to death, they were sawed in two, they were killed with the sword. . . . they were driven from place to place, destitute, persecuted, misused—men of whom the world was not worthy.” (Heb. 11:37,38, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) So</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah’s witnesses of more than 2,000 years ago were looked upon as undesirables, too!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After these men foretold the coming of the Messiah and the new world, Jehovah sent his Son into the world that 'whosoever believeth on him might gain eternal life’. His Son, Christ Jesus, during his ministry upon the earth preached the greatest message of all time: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This is a message which the nations of the earth as a whole, the religious organizations and the men of commerce of these nations have completely ignored down through the 1900 years that have passed since the death of Christ, and right up to the present time. Jesus himself said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” and the world rulers have shown they will have none of this Kingdom, but rather they are determined to rule the world themselves—they will be the supreme rulers. They have not accepted and will not accept the king chosen by Jehovah, His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, who proved himself worthy of that high position of kingship over this earth. Speaking of the nations, Jehovah says, “Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.” The Anointed One or Messiah was looked upon as an undesirable, and the people cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him 1” But the Almighty God declares, “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.”—Ps. 2:1, 2, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Now he is and ever will be “the faithful and true witness”. The apostles, Peter, John, Paul—all of them, and hundreds of disciples who followed Jesus 1900 years ago—were Jehovah’s witnesses, preaching the same message. Then came the early church which received persecution at the hands of the Jews, Greeks and Romans. Some were stoned to death; others were thrown to the lions. Many were forced to hide in caves and in the wilderness, but as they fled from place to place they continued to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. During the Dark Ages righteous men broke away from the Catholic Church and other religious organizations because the doctrines taught by them were so intermingled with pagan teachings. The Bible truths were hidden; in fact, the Catholic Church made every effort to keep the Bible from the people. But right down through the ages Jehovah God has had witnesses to minister the message of the Kingdom despite all the opposition to make them quit such talk. Now as we draw nearer to the new world of righteousness Jehovah has raised up more witnesses and blessed them in carrying this good news to others, but they have never become popular.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>MODERN ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It was back in the year 1884 that a group of men and women in America came together and drew up a charter which set out as its purpose the dissemination of Bible truths. But even before this, as far back as 1870, these lovers of God’s Word were studying it diligently. They were looking for the complete establishment of God’s kingdom, and from 1874 to 1877 they published a booklet, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Object and Manner of the Lord’s Return.</span><span class="font7"> Bible classes were started in and about Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and these folk made a careful study of the Bible truth concerning the three worlds: the one overflowed by water in Noah’s day; the “present evil world” and how it would come to its end; and the third world, the world without end, “wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3) Then in July, 1879, the first issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Zion’s Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> was published, and it has been continued to this day, a magazine announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. Seventy years have passed, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> has a circulation of 600,000 copies on the 1st and 15th of every month, in scores of languages. In order to reach more people tracts were printed and distributed free. Some were called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Old Theology Quarterly</span><span class="font7"> and others </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Food for Thinking Christians.</span><span class="font7"> Expansion of the work resulted, and in 1884 Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society was organized and given a charter by the State of Pennsylvania in the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These Christians looked to Jehovah God as the supreme and only Ruler of the universe. He had decreed through his Word that he would establish a government of righteousness which will bring peace and prosperity to all people who desire to serve him in spirit and in truth. The teachings of these Christians associated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society were different from those taught by the recognized religious organizations. From the early days the clergy objected to laymen’s studying the Bible and teaching from it. They felt that their profession should not be invaded by “unlearned men”. One thing the Society did was to direct the attention of the people to the Bible, not to man-made creeds and ideas. Bible study brought to the fore again the good news of God’s kingdom, and that was the big thing foretold by the prophets and later by Jesus and the apostles. That the earth was made for man to live upon was clearly seen in their study. Man is to be the keeper of the earth and make it beautiful. The earth, not hell, purgatory or heaven, is man’s home. This teaching certainly was contrary to the creeds of Christendom; but, if proved true by the Bible, it must be proclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This good news was preached by word of mouth, and millions of tracts were printed for free distribution and personal home study. From 1886 to 1893 these Christians distributed 2,459,609 tracts. As time went on they intensified their distribution work to one, two, three and four million tracts a year. They delivered them from door to door, to those going to the churches and those coming from the churches. The message they contained was truly “food for thinking Christians”. Finally the tract distribution grew to more than 20 million yearly in 1910, and by 1918 the record shows a grand total of at least 324,000,000 copies of tracts that had been distributed by these early workers of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Up until 1918, according to reports available, 8,993,166 bound books also were distributed, and these were used in home Bible studies. Millions of other booklets and pamphlets were placed with the people by these witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1896 the name of the Society was changed from Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It surely has been a Bible and Tract Society since its incorporation, because great stress has been placed on home Bible study. Following the Scriptural admonition to preach “publicly, and from house to house”, the first president of the Society, prior to his death, in 1916, went on lecture tours throughout the United States and various parts of the world. He introduced the “colporteur work”, today known as the “pioneer service”. He established congregations in many places and arranged for conventions of God’s people. The “pilgrim” work was organized for traveling lecturers to visit all congregations, and the “Bible House” or first Bethel home was built in Pittsburgh in 1898. In the year 1900 the first Branch office was established in London, England, and in 1909 a New York corporation was brought into existence. By the year 1910 there was so much interest in the lectures of the president that newspapers began to syndicate his sermons. Starting with just a few newspapers in 1910, by 1914 more than 1,000 newspapers in various parts of the world were publishing his sermons. As Jehovah’s witnesses look back over the years from 1884 to 1914 they see that many things happened in preparing the way before the Lord God, who began his reign in 1914. The Scriptures foretold this preparing work, at Malachi 3:1: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the time had arrived for Christ Jesus to receive his power and begin to reign. This he did as described in Revelation, the 12th chapter. Furthermore the “times of the Gentiles” ended, giving chronological proof from the Bible that what Jehovah’s witnesses had for years prophesied had come true. (Sec Daniel chapter 4 and Luke 21:24.) Also the physical facts proved that the end of the Devil’s rule without any interruption or interference had been reached. Matthew, the 24th chapter, sets out the answer to the apostles’ questions as to the end of the world and Jesus’ second presence. All these things took place, but for detailed proof on the subject see the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses could not and did not conclude that the great work of honoring Jehovah’s name before the final end comes had been finished. No, the Scriptures pointed out that before the Devil’s organization and the nations under “the god of this world” were destroyed a great, final witness must be given. Jesus said This gospel of the Kingdom must be preached unto all nations before the end comes’. That meant more work from 1914 and especially from 1918 onward. “Other sheep I have,” Jesus said, and these must be gathered, too, before the battle of the great day of God Almighty. This meant expansion, and the slogan of Jehovah’s witnesses became “Advertise, advertise, advertise the King and the Kingdom!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To do this it required organization world-wide, and it meant putting to use all the instruments that could be used to further the gospel-preaching. Jehovah’s witnesses of today still use the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as a servant organization to carry on their work throughout the whole world. This Pennsylvania corporation is not the only Society used by Jehovah’s witnesses. A New York corporation, established in 1909, now known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., serves Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States of America. Another association, known as the International Bible Students Association, is a servant to Jehovah’s witnesses in London, England, and a similar society exists in Canada. Other corporations of Jehovah’s witnesses have been formed in France, in the various countries of Europe, and in South America. But all of these corporations work to the same end, namely, preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1944 the charter of the Pennsylvania corporation was amended, and under the second article it is shown that the purposes of the Society are “To act as the servant of and the legal world-wide governing agency for that body of Christian persons known as Jehovah’s witnesses”, which function it is fulfilling; further, “to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus unto all nations as a witness to the name, word and supremacy of Almighty God JEHOVAH.” For proof that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing this, read the Society’s yearly reports of activity, particularly from 1918 onward. The reader will see that Jehovah’s witnesses have diligently and without hesitation put forth every effort to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom, making known Jehovah’s name and word, and that year by year they have expanded that witness, reaching even to the ends of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never before in all history has the announcement been made so publicly, so persistently, and on such a world-wide scale as is now being done by Jehovah’s witnesses. Let the report on pages 20-23 speak for itself.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>THE ANALYSIS OF THE REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The charter further provides for the Society “to print and distribute Bibles and to disseminate Bible truths in various languages by means of making and publishing literature containing information and comment explaining Bible truths and prophecy concerning establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus”. In the last year alone they made and distributed Bibles, bound books and pamphlets to the number of 17,031,901 copies in 96 different nations, colonies, isles of the sea and territories of nations. Not only this, but they have also placed magazines in the hands of the people to the extent of 11,380,767. These magazines were </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> as published in the principal languages of the earth. Hundreds of thousands of subscriptions were also taken for these magazines so that the publications could go directly into the homes of the people for careful study and reading. Since 1920, Bibles, books (ranging from 300 to 400 pages) and booklets (of 32 or 64 pages) have been distributed to the grand total of 530,218,352 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still neither the Society nor Jehovah’s witnesses are “booksellers”. What Jehovah’s witnesses offer to the peoples of the world in various languages are printed sermons, Bible information. After talking personally to the people and arousing their interest in Bible study, Jehovah’s witnesses leave literature with them for private study. If the person so benefited wishes to make a contribution to cover the cost of printing and distribution, he may do so, and most persons do. However, millions of booklets are left each year with the people who want to read but who feel</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">unable to make a small contribution at the time. None of the thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses going from door to door ever receive a salary for doing the work of preaching. They do their work because they are consecrated to promote true worship of Jehovah God and to give a witness concerning God’s kingdom. The oral sermon is first; placing literature is secondary. It is an aid to further study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is also authorized to “appoint agents, servants, employees, teachers, instructors, evangelists, missionaries and ministers to go forth to all the world publicly and from house to house to preach and teach Bible truths to persons willing to listen, by leaving with such persons said literature and by conducting Bible studies thereon”. This Jehovah’s witnesses have very definitely done during the past service year, as their field service record shows. The report is not one of members, for Jehovah’s witnesses do not have enrolled congregations. But it is the heap of witness that was piled up by the workers in the congregations world-wide. This is truly a Society of evangelists, missionaries and ministers who are located in 96 different parts of the earth. There are now 230,532 ambassadors for the kingdom of God engaging in preaching the gospel every month, as compared with 181,071 for the previous year. That means that there are now 49,461 more ministers who have been instructed and properly taught through Bible study the truth from God’s Word so they, too, could be authorized and appointed as servants, teachers, and ministers and assigned to go forth in some territory and publicly preach this good news of God’s kingdom from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The glad tidings that these 230,532 ministers are carrying to the ends of the earth were so happily received by thousands that by the end of the year even greater numbers were receiving special training to “go . . . make disciples of all the nations”. This new interest added to the average monthly number of publishers totaled 260,756, to compare with last year’s all-time high peak of 207,552 ministers. This was an increase of 53,204 more persons advertising the Kingdom than ever before. This is marvelous in our eyes, and we trust and pray that all of those who have taken their stand for the Kingdom and have made a consecration to serve the Most High God will continue faithfully throughout 1949 and forever, preaching this good news. That is the covenant all of them have made, to preach “publicly, and from house to house” these Bible truths to persons who are willing to listen. This we sincerely believe they will do, and the Supreme One of all the universe will pour upon them His blessing as they continue to serve. These new ministers recognize Jehovah’s supremacy and choose to serve Him rather than this dying old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was suggested last year that every company organization throughout the world try to increase its organization by 10 percent in the number of publishers carrying this good news to the people. By so doing a greater witness could be given. The chartered purpose of the Society is to prepare such teachers, instructors and evangelists, and so it is only proper that every group of Christians put forth diligent effort to carry on such Bible instruction in their Kingdom Halls and in private home Bible-study classes. During the 1947 service year there was an increase of 14 percent over 1946 in gathering instructors together; but 1948 showed an unusual increase, of 27 percent, in the average number of publishers monthly engaging in Kingdom work. The company organizations throughout the world have done splendid work in preparing ministers. Did your company share in this increase? Are you prepared during 1949 to welcome the stranger into your midst and help him to know Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the chartered purposes of the Society is: “To improve men, women and children mentally and morally by Christian missionary work and by charitable and benevolent instruction of the people on the Bible and incidental scientific, historical and literary subjects; to establish and maintain private Bible schools and classes for gratuitous instruction of men and women in the Bible, Bible literature and Bible history”. The charter further provides that we shall “teach, train, prepare and equip men and women as ministers, missionaries, evangelists, preachers, teachers and lecturers”. So that this can be accomplished in a regular and systematic manner, Jehovah’s witnesses have weekly study periods for the benefit of all who are desirous of taking up the ministry. There are three weekly meetings that every minister and every person preparing for the ministry should attend: the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, the service meeting, and the Theocratic ministry school. There are other book studies that can be attended, too, but the three mentioned are essential to proper training and advancement in knowledge and wisdom in God’s Word. Actually, during 1948, 49,461 more students have prepared themselves to be lecturers, teachers and ministers and have engaged in the preaching work every month so as to improve others mentally and morally by their Christian missionary work. A goodly number of this group have taken up the full-time service. There are now 8,994 pioneers in the full-time work, to compare with the 1947 total of 7,017; an increase of 1,977.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Answering specifically the question as to what Jehovah’s witnesses are doing today, it can be stated that they are preaching the message of God’s kingdom from house to house and publicly, following the example set by Christ Jesus. Nor is this being done on a small scale; for these 230,532 regular monthly publishers of the Kingdom have devoted 49,832,205 hours in ministerial activity. This is an increase of almost six million hours above the previous year. During these millions of hours they have endeavored to instruct, train, prepare and equip men and women by helping them to a better understanding of the Bible. This has been done, not by gathering a congregation to their church, but by going from house to house. Then by going back to the homes of the people where they placed literature they were able to give them further instruction and help. The number of such calls made was 13,807,920. These we term “back-calls”, and they are made on all persons showing interest in Bible study, persons from all religions and walks of life. Not all of these calls develop into studies where careful scrutiny can be given to the Bible and its teachings, but Jehovah’s witnesses have conducted on the average 130,281 Bible studies in the homes of interested people every week for the past year. If there were only an average of four persons attending each of these studies, it would mean more than a half million people who were being taught by Jehovah’s witnesses every week. That would make quite a congregation of regular students in addition to the millions of persons visited daily in the regular house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses not only provide for these home Bible studies, but they also give instruction in public meetings held in parks, auditoriums, halls, schools, playgrounds, in fact, almost anywhere that the people will assemble. Last year 133,634 such advertised public meetings were arranged for in all parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Memorial season of the year Jehovah’s witnesses and people interested in their work assembled to celebrate the death of the Lord Jesus Christ; and 376,393 persons were in attendance Thursday night, March 25, 1948. Of this number, 25,395 partook of the bread and wine, which indicated their belief that they had been invited to the high calling with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom. The others professed to be his “other sheep” with prospects of everlasting life on this earth under the kingdom of heaven. This yearly Memorial service was arranged for by the 11,714 company organizations throughout the world. These company organizations also hold regular studies in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> as well as conduct service meetings and Theocratic ministry schools. All these services are free, and no collections are ever taken. It is all part of the gratuitous education carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide on behalf of all peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This tremendous volume of work, preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom unto the ends of the earth, is not done with any political ambition in mind, nor are Jehovah’s witnesses trying to influence the policies of the governments. They have no “lobby” in the capitals of the different nations; they are not trying to establish some religious order, nor is there any pecuniary gain in it for any individuals. Anyone who observes Jehovah’s witnesses in any of the lands reported on in this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> will know they are not engaged in any of those endeavors. They have one thing to do, and that is to preach the message of God’s kingdom. Christ Jesus directed that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness” until the end comes, and that Jehovah’s witnesses are definitely trying to do as ambassadors in the 96 countries on which reports are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is a nonprofit organization, and what monies it receives it uses for the spreading of the gospel unto the ends of the earth. During the 1948 service year the Brooklyn office sent money and literature to its Branch offices valued at $488,821.22. In addition to that, for foreign service or expansion work in various countries where Branches are not established, assistance was required to the amount of $110,851.11. Literature and supplies were sent to some countries as gifts, and this amounted to $118,608.04. This meant a total outlay of $718,280.37 to assist the preaching of the gospel outside the United States. A few of the large Branches were able to remit to the Brooklyn office to cover the cost of some of the shipments made, and these remittances amounted to $296,119.58. That left a balance of $422,170.79 that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society paid out during 1948 for the expansion work in territories outside the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Knowing the needs of Jehovah’s witnesses in other countries, the Society as the servant to Jehovah’s witnesses also arranged to send food and clothing for relief to their brethren. Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark were in position to gather together clothing, food and other necessary supplies to aid their fellow ministers in war-torn lands. The large quantities of food were purchased with money contributed for that purpose; and clothing, shoes, bedding and other supplies were freely donated to the Society for shipment to various parts of the earth where needed. The total value of the food, clothing and the shipping costs for relief only from January, 1946, up to and including August, 1948, amounted to $1,322,406.90. This figure does not include the value of any time spent on the part of the brethren in gathering the clothing from all parts of the United States, Canada and other countries, and then packing it, shipping it to Brooklyn, rehandling it at Brooklyn, or distributing it in other lands. This service was an additional free gift on their part and a joyful service which enabled Jehovah’s witnesses to help their brethren in other parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society, too, wishes to express its appreciation for the hearty co-operation on the part of all these earnest and hard workers, as well as to pass along the sincere gratitude of the recipients of these gifts to those who gave them. This has certainly been an expression of love one toward another. We know all of the brethren did this as an honor to the Lord, having in mind that this material assistance would help some to carry on their true worship; and so they esteemed it a great privilege to be able to serve their brethren in this manner. This act of kindness to their neighbors is just another proof that Jehovah’s witnesses are not in this work for any commercial gain.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font7">Men and women who really want to know the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses will look at their work, their teachings and their service to Jehovah’s kingdom with clear vision not blurred by gossip, false statements and prejudice. When one sees the truth, he will want more of it and in time will become a real minister. Once in a while you hear a person say, “I am afraid to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. When I get to believing everything like you do, I’ll lose all my old friends. I might become involved in something, and I don’t want to take on the responsibility of going from house to house the way you do. I would be ridiculed and maybe persecuted like you are.” This is entirely the wrong attitude for any individual to take. One cannot straddle the fence. Individuals must take a stand for Jehovah’s new world or stick with the old one. The Scriptures clearly point out that you cannot serve God and the Devil. You must be either hot or cold; you must be either for or against the Lord. Persons who are desirous of engaging in the political, commercial or religious affairs of the world, supporting them even as they support one another in opposition to the supremacy of the Almighty God, will have to go down with that old world organization when it is destroyed at the battle of Armageddon. The decision must be made now in these last days of the old world. It pays to serve Jehovah. He alone can give you life, while the wages sin pays is death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who know this hearken to the Lord’s Word and study it. The Bible is the true guide. It will guide you to the right course of action, preaching the good news you learn. It is the truth that makes one free from politics, religion and commerce. You should never be afraid of becoming involved in something that frees you from death and leads to life. “Endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him w<sup>r</sup>ho hath chosen him to be a soldier.” (2 Tim. 2:3-4) This does not mean that you will be able to go through life now without any hardships or trials or difficulties. No,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses face these on every hand. Jesus warned that things would not be easy for his servants; even as they persecuted him, they will also persecute you. “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.”—John 15:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures point out, ‘This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’ Therefore, Jehovah’s witnesses are very earnest in their endeavor to praise Jehovah yet “more and more”. They know one can learn the way to gain eternal life through a knowledge of God’s Word. A lover of life, not a destroyer of it, wants to see his fellow man live too; so, having been trained in Jehovah’s principles of truth and righteousness, he will want to ‘go . . . and disciple all nations’. This is the mission of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they are trying to do it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reports you will read on the various countries and the chart you have looked over on pages 20-23 show clearly how Jehovah’s witnesses are advancing from one end of the world to the other. They are not doing this grand work hi their own strength: they are doing it by the spirit of God. It is not because of their own ability that they make progress and expand, but it is because God is with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May we urge all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere to make the 1949 service year your biggest year yet, not only in hours in the field, but in making back-calls on interested persons. Carry on that good work of Bible education and continue in the splendid activity of conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people. Enlarge your congregations in the homes of people of good-will and train men and women to be good ministers of God’s kingdom. World-wide we can hear Jehovah’s witnesses saying in unison, “I . . . will yet praise thee more and more.”—Psalm 71:14.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ was an ordained minister, and he received his ordination to preach from his Father in heaven. Luke, in his gospel, chapter 4, verse 18, tells us that Jesus quoted these words from the book of Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> By applying these words to himself, Jesus recognized his ordination came from God. Christ Jesus at all times did the will of his Father and recognized that his Father sent him to do a special work. In turn he sent his apostles into the world to carry on the same ministerial activity, as recorded at John 17:18 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7">: “As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.” Jesus’ command was very definite, too, when he said, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.”—Matt. 28:19, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This scripture is being fulfilled in our day the same as it was in the early days of the apostles in that ministers are being ordained throughout all the world to carry on this discipling work, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses are a society of ordained ministers. Because of the commands of God these servants who have taken God’s name will preach the Kingdom as the only hope for the world. Because Jehovah’s witnesses do not proclaim the United Nations organization nor any individual nation in which they live as the greatest nation and the hope of the world, they are hated by the world. God has not ordained his witnesses to preach and advertise the governments of this earth, but he commanded them to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. Because of this the Lord Jesus warned his followers, “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. ... If they have persecuted me they will persecute you too. ... I have told you this to keep you from faltering. They will exclude you from their synagogues; why, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is doing religious service to God. They will do this because they do not know the Father or me. But I have told you about these things in order that when the time comes for them to happen, you may remember that I told you of them.”—John 15:18-20; 16:1-4, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">An American Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are fully consecrated to do God’s will and are ordained of him to proclaim the grand message of God’s kingdom throughout all the world. In order to arrange the work in an orderly manner world-wide, the Society has appointed ordained ministers as special servants to act in different capacities in the various countries of the world. Some of these are located in the Bethel home, the principal office of the Society in Brooklyn, New York; many are located in the Branch offices throughout the world, and some are assigned as special servants to the company organizations. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> publishes a list of the ordained ministers who have special duties to perform as servants to their brethren.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This school is dedicated to the training of ordained Christian ministers. The Lord counsels through his Word, “The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich.” Certainly those who have experienced the special, spiritual training of Gilead school have been made very rich in knowledge and understanding of God’s Word. Men and women are called from all parts of the world to receive this advanced ministerial training which befits one for missionary work in the world-wide field. The instruction received is very intense and it greatly benefits the students who receive this special education in five fleeting months. The students’ hearts overflow with gratitude and appreciation to their Great Teachers, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and to their brethren throughout all the world, who have made it possible for them to enjoy this profitable season of spiritual feasting and of never-to-be-forgotten Christian fellowship in their daily association with other brethren of like precious faith. This school has been made possible by the generous contributions on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the 1948 service year a new building was constructed at the school, and it Is called Shiloah. The principal room is a combination library and classroom. In this library there are more than 6,000 publications, thus allowing the students to do greater research work than heretofore. The tenth and eleventh classes that have gone to Gilead have had the privilege of taking full advantage of this new structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after the Los Angeles convention in August, 1947, 103 faithful pioneer brethren assembled for their first day of school at Gilead. This was known as the tenth class. The group was comprised mainly of American ministers, and associated with them were eighteen Canadian ministers, all of whom would become students for a period of five months. A number in this class have prepared themselves for African assignments, as this field is now opening up for the giving of a greater witness concerning the Kingdom. It is the Society’s hope to get many missionaries into the countries of Africa, there to educate and train the people along Bible lines. From September 3 to February 8 those of the group who were able to finish the school course worked diligently, and on their graduation day they rejoiced that they had had this blessed training and could now look forward to an assignment in some territory where not too much gospel-preaching had been carried on before. Ninety-nine graduated in this tenth class, and ninety received diplomas of merit. All, however, were qualified to be missionary representatives of the Society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">On February 25 the president of the Society opened the eleventh term, and an address was given to 110 students from many nations. It was the second international assembly of ministers to be trained together for a period of five months. The students were natives or residents of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, England, Finland, Germany, Hawaii, India, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and Wales. All could speak and understand English; so it was not long until they were settled down to their school work, adapting themselves quickly to the fast tempo of Gilead life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the first quarter ended, the president of the Society asked for volunteers to go to Japan. The reason for this was so a class could be started in the Japanese language. Out of the great number of all the student body who responded, the president chose 22 to comprise a special Japanese class which was to be taught the Japanese language by one of their own number, a student born in Hawaii of Japanese-American parents. He was very well versed in the language, and he became the first student-teacher of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time sped by too rapidly and soon the whirl of graduation events came with the parting of good friends; and what a strain it was! Graduation was held on a Sunday morning, August 1, 1948, on the spacious, green lawn of the campus. Not only was this Gilead’s largest graduating class, totaling 108, but here was the largest number ever to come to a graduation exercise at Gilead. There were 3,559 assembled for this blessed occasion. All the graduates are looking forward to some foreign assignment. Many will be returning to their own countries to continue in the ministry, bringing to their fellow ministers the good information they learned at Gilead school, as well as the information they gained through their association with the home office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, in Brooklyn, New York. One hundred and five students received diplomas of merit. All 108 students qualified for misssionary assignments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Watchtower Bible School is located on the property of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., which is known as Kingdom Farm. The members of the faculty and the members of the Kingdom Farm family deem it a singular privilege to be stationed at this part of the Lord’s vineyard. The joys and the blessings are numerous, and it certainly Is a privilege for this group to serve as hosts to the hundreds of student guests who pass through the portals of Gilead in the course of time. All who are permanent members of the family operating the school and the farm have a keen feeling of close relationship to the great work of preaching the gospel in all the world for a witness. As they hear of the increase of the work in other lands and of the splendid work done by graduates from Gilead, it makes their hearts glad that they have had the opportunity of serving these brethren for a period of time at Kingdom Farm. Not only that, but they have the privilege of sending food supplies to the Brooklyn headquarters, where Bibles, books, magazines and other literature are published, bringing comfort to the people of all nations. They fully appreciate that food must be provided for these workers in the Bethel home as well as for the students at school. Knowing that the Lord places the members in the body or in His organization as it pleases Him, they are satisfied and content to do this service in addition to their regular ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All these brethren at Kingdom Farm have the opportunity of witnessing and conducting private studies in the homes of the people, while others have the opportunity of serving companies and delivering public discourses in the vicinity served by the Kingdom Farm family. As part of God’s organization they stand ready to serve their brethren, and they always avail themselves of the open door of service which is set before them for proclaiming the Signal and heralding the early vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s Word tells us that His people must 'enlarge the tent and strengthen the cords’. Expansion, the welcoming of the stranger, the broadening of the field of service—these have been the foremost ideas in the minds of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. All this means a greater witness to the King and the Kingdom. The Bethel family shares this spirit with the Lord’s servants throughout the earth. The members of the Bethel family feel that they are in the center of world-wide expansion. Almost daily graduates from Gilead are guests of the Bethel home. They are either on their way out to foreign assignments or they have returned to the States for a short visit. Being hosts to these missionaries is a pleasure for everyone. Not only does the family gain the feeling of expansion through close association with individuals going into these far-off fields, but the family is busy producing the publications which are shipped to the ends of the earth. Then, too, right at home they have seen the start of the new Bethel headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We cannot help but reflect for a moment over the past year. During the year the houses across the street from Bethel, 111 and 113 Columbia Heights, were renovated, redecorated and put into condition for housing a large number of the Bethel family who for a time were living in the five four-story brownstonefront apartments which were still standing on the site where the new Bethel home was to be built. What a joy it was to the Bethel family when on March 15 the wrecking crew began to tear down these old buildings. In two months they were leveled to the ground, and on May 20 the large power shovel moved in to begin excavation. On July 14 the first concrete was poured for the foundations of the new Bethel home. Good progress has been made thus far, but, due to delayed deliveries of steel, not much more can be done than putting in the tremendous footings and the reinforced concrete walls for the two basement floors. By the Lord’s grace, the 1950 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font7">will be able to tell you much more about the Bethel home and the construction of the new factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Simultaneously during the year the construction of WBBR’s new transmitter and its towers was proceeding very well. It was a memorable occasion when, on May 25, 1948, at 7 p.m., WBBR at Staten Island officially went on the air with 5,000 watts power, sending the message out through its brand-new transmitter. The Kingdom message was sounded clearly to a greater audience than ever before. The brethren serving on WBBR are happy to sing Jehovah’s praises regularly throughout the whole week in the metropolitan area and the near-by states where reception is good. WBBR is the only radio station in the world wholly dedicated to the preaching of the gospel of God’s kingdom, and that it will do in the headquarters city of the United Nations. Jehovah’s witnesses financed the construction of the WBBR radio station much more quickly than the United Nations with all the money in the world were able to finance and begin construction on their new world capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The spirit of the brethren in all of the Society’s institutions is to “yet praise thee more and more”. This is the feeling one will get as he reads excerpts from the Branch servant’s report for the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been a joyful lot for the Bethel family here in the Branch during the past year as we have joined with our brethren world-wide in singing praises to our merciful God, Jehovah. It has been a particular joy to us all to have a big share in advancing Kingdom interests in other countries. Last year at the Los Angeles assembly Brother Knorr expressed the thought that particular stress would be given in 1948 to publishing and providing literature in languages suitable for our brethren in countries outside of the United States. It was with this goal in mind that we endeavored to publish the books and booklets in as many translations as possible. Jehovah blessed the Bethel family’s determination to fulfill this hope, because the Brooklyn factory actually shipped out more bound books to Branches than were shipped out to companies and pioneers in the United States by approximately 1,300,000 copies. In fact, books, Bibles and booklets shipped out of Brooklyn to the Branches during 1948 totaled 10,142,788, whereas books, Bibles and booklets shipped out in the United States totaled 8,898,142.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is visible proof that the Lord’s organization is not nationalistic or limited to one country, but is interested in the world-wide organization and the peoples of all lands, nationalities, kindreds and tongues. It has been our privilege this past year to publish books and booklets in 37 different languages, including two new ones, Hiligaynon-Visayan and Papiamento. We feel our responsibility to continue giving special attention to serving our brethren in foreign lands, knowing the difficulties they have in getting literature. The scarcity of paper has been eased somewhat, and this will make it possible for us to print more booklets than heretofore. During the year we were able to print 9,770,141 more booklets than during the previous year. With more paper available, we should be able to Increase our production of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> for 1949. In the past year, however, there was a decrease in the number of copies printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are prepared to give better mailing service on these two magazines, because during the year we built and installed new wrapping machines for handling </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> These were built In our own shop and have proved very helpful In the Society’s endeavor to keep our mailing schedules up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States Branch factory has used 2,877 tons of paper on its 13 printing presses. Along with Jehovah’s witnesses in the field, this printed paper has helped to pile up a “heap of witness”, all to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is a joy to every member of the family to see progress being made on the new Bethel home, and all are anxious now to see the start of the new factory. The first step as to the expansion of the factory facilities was the enlarging of the Diesel power plant for producing electricity. A new 525-h.p. Diesel engine was installed and is now operating splendidly; so, as far as power is concerned, we are ready to go ahead when the new plant is constructed. One reason for delay in the construction of the new factory has been caused by arrangements to move the tenant occupying the one remaining building. When he moves out, construction will begin.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>FIELD SERVICE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Following the theme set by the yeartext, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations,” Jehovah’s witnesses in this land began a year of praise. Early in their service year a convention was arranged for the eastern part of the United States in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, November 21-23. It was a “Song of Praise” Assembly. Representatives came from 44 states, Canada, and from countries to the south. The good things that were brought to the attention of the publishers at this assembly will long be remembered. Outstanding was the talk by Brother Knorr on “Gaining Entrance to Permanent Dwellings”, dealing with the parable of the unjust steward. Jehovah’s witnesses have proved themselves to be just stewards by their wise use of mammon in assisting the brethren in foreign countries. The brethren were told that three times as much money had been contributed for European relief as had been expected, namely, $310,000, which was received from the brethren in the United States and Canada to assist those in need in foreign lands. Many were the misty eyes as Brother Knorr described from his own personal observation the plight of our brethren in other countries; and how happy all were to hear that soon tons of clothing would also be collected and sent abroad in addition to the food that was then being packed and sent out. An unexpected surprise came when the 1948 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> and Calendar were released at this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Saturday 20,000 were in attendance when the president of the Society delivered the talk “The Signal to the People”. Unanimously the crowd roared their thunderous approval of the resolution which he afterwards read and which denounced as unsatisfactory any man-made substitute for the Signal around which Christians rally, the enthroned King, Christ Jesus. With such a leader, the service in which they would engage for the coming year would certainly be telling against the Devil and his standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Splendid advertising was carried on in the city of Philadelphia in connection with the public talk which was to be delivered Sunday afternoon. The subject “Permanent Governor of All Nations” attracted much attention, and 28,000 persons were in attendance to hear that speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The climax of the convention came with the announcement by the Society’s president that there was to be a change in the pioneer requirements in order to make it possible for more of Jehovah’s witnesses to take part in this special service. Higher living costs and fewer placements of literature and the desire to increase back-call activity made it difficult for pioneers to continue without outside assistance. Figures were presented to show the large turnover in pioneer ranks. The Society knew of the many who wanted to be in this service: their hearts were there, but from time to time they had to drop out for ‘tent-making’, as did Paul. But then these publishers did not cease publishing; they became company publishers, just as Paul did, ‘preaching every sabbath in the synagogue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was announced that beginning January 1, 1948, the Society would reduce the pioneer requirements for regular pioneers from 150 hours to 120 hours per month, or 1400 hours per year. It was the belief of the president that after the brethren had thought this matter over carefully there would be a good increase in the number of pioneers for 1948. This proved to be true. During the year a total of 2,147 new general pioneers were enrolled. Throughout the year an average of 4,143 pioneers were on the list, or 5.7 percent of all the publishers. While this is a good increase over last year’s average of 3,513 pioneers, we here in the United States are still striving for that desired goal of 10 percent of all publishers in the pioneer service. The year’s peak foi pioneer enrollment was reached in July, with a total of 5,632. It is hoped that the American brethren will maintain this latter figure as an average for the 1949 service year and reach even higher peaks in the pioneer ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In speaking of pioneers we must acknowledge our vacation pioneers In the United States. Seven hundred and ninety-six individuals joined this group of full-time servants during their vacation months. What a grand testimony of faith and love for Jehovah was here shown by the obedient and wise courst lovingly chosen by these young ministers of God’s Word!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those brethren selected for special pioneer service did well throughout the year, but the Society is reducing this number in the United States because of the great missionary work that is taking place throughout the whole world. Funds previously spent on the special pioneer work in the United States are now being devoted to taking care of special pioneers in the missionary field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding figure in the United States report is that of the publishers. Special effort was made throughout the year to help newly interested persons engage in field service and to aid the irregular publishers to get out more often. We believe that if the circuit servants and the company servants carry along the endeavor during 1949 even greater peaks will be reached In the number of publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom in the United States. The average number of ordained ministers preaching every month was 72,945, whereas the peak number was 78,666 publishers, in the month of July. The United States had five successive new monthly peaks of publishers. This was the first time that this had ever been experienced in the United States. Last year there were 67,680 publishers in the field, on the average, and this year we see a 7.7-percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Increase over 1947. While this was an increase of 5,265 publishers out in the field every month over last year, it was still not our desired 10-percent increase. By the Lord’s grace, we hope to have an average of 80,000 publishers in the field during the 1949 service year, which would include our 10-percent Increase over the 1948 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of book studies has increased over 1947, there being a weekly average of 51,023. The public meeting activity was outstanding, too, in that we held 45,446 public meetings, to compare with 37,359 the previous year. To advertise these meetings effectively 118,573,201 handbills were printed for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Additionally, the Lord provided good things for all of his people throughout this country in the new arrangement of district assemblies. In 1948 assemblies were held in Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, San Francisco, California, and, just at the close of the year, in Des Moines, Iowa, Chicago, Illinois, and Providence, Rhode Island. These three-day meetings were packed with practical field service instructions, demonstrations and helpful discourses. We feel sure the effect of these assemblies will be outstanding in the 1949 service year, and the announced new arrangement of 12 district assemblies for the United States should prove to be even more profitable in the better organization of the work here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The general relationship of our door-to-door work with the law has been peaceful throughout the country, and very little interference has been encountered. There were a few arrests, but most of the brethren were freed by higher court authorities without trial in court. The right to do door-to-door work in apartment houses, however, continues to be challenged in some cities. This trouble has been smoldering up through the courts of New York state and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Cases involving working in apartment houses will soon be before the Supreme Court of the United States. Application has been made to this high court to grant review of the decision of the New York courts in the Parkchester case, and an appeal is being taken to the Supreme Court on a Virginia case involving the same thing so that the court can consider the New York and Virginia cases together. We sincerely hope the Supreme Court will review these cases and give a decision early in 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our use of open public places such as parks, public squares and public schools for our public meetings has received the Lord’s blessing. Thousands of persons who ordinarily would not come to public meetings have heard the comforting words from ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses in the parks and public squares. In a few Instances efforts have been put forth by truth-haters to prevent such meetings. A group of Legionnaires in Toledo, Iowa, tried to break up a meeting on April 18; however, these Legionnaires later apologized for their actions when they found out the true nature of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. A later meeting was arranged, and, Instead of having 60 In attendance, 137 came out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the outstanding cases in the United States was the Saia case which originated in Lockport, New York. It was held by the lower courts that sound equipment could not be used in the public parks, but the Supreme Court of the United States held that the city or the state could not prohibit the use of sound equipment by Jehovah’s witnesses at a public meeting in a park, nor require a permit as a condition precedent to the use thereof. It was held that a sound device was a necessity in order to reach large audiences In these modern days. The decision received widespread publicity by periodicals published for lawyers as well as by the public press. The public meeting work in parks and public squares will be vn the increase in the United States because of this fine decision by the United States Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As long as Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the good news of the Kingdom there are going to be objectors. At a circuit assembly held In Parkersburg, West Virginia, a mob was led by a now-discredited leader of the veterans organization, and they attempted to break up a meeting in the school at Parkersburg. Their disorderly conduct resulted In the gathering of a large crowd of curious onlookers, so that over 1,000 heard the public lecture through loud-speakers outside the auditorium, in addition to the 500 who got inside. The community spoke out courageously against such cowardly action, and later 3,500 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> containing the facts on the mob action were distributed throughout Parkersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A similar Incident occurred at Burlington, Vermont, on May 23, when a mob of three to four hundred, inspired by the truth-hating mayor, gathered outside the State Armory after a previous attempt to disrupt a public meeting being held there had been unsuccessful. Far from putting a stop to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses In the community as had been their hope, the mobsters found themselves deluged by indignant protests from the aroused citizenry. The witnesses themselves became better organized and more active than before, and the people of good-wili are now openly taking their stand against violence and in favor of the truth. Many persons wrote letters asking witnesses to call upon them to explain what had really happened and to tell them of their beliefs. Again the facts were printed in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> and 150 ministers of Jehovah placed 9,000 copies with the householders, businessmen and officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year has been a most blessed one with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> campaign, the various testimony periods and the various circuit and district assemblies—all of this added up to a year of praise to Jehovah. It is our firm belief that great advances are yet to be made in the United States among the people of good-will and that the year ahead will give us grand opportunities for preaching the gospel to those who want to hear and who will come. It Is our desire to point to the Signal, Christ Jesus our Commander, and to Jehovah God, the Sovereign of all the universe, as we sing his praises more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men of good-will are scattered over the face of the entire earth. These, too, must be reached with the message of the Kingdom. As the Society has opportunity, special missionaries are sent to the islands of the sea or to lands where little or no organization has been formed for the preaching of the gospel. In still other places Jehovah’s witnesses have to migrate from one land to another because of their business, and they carry the truth with them. It is marvelous how the truth reaches out to the ends of the earth, and Jehovah’s witnesses are anxious to spread it into every nook and corner.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font7">When there is a sufficient number of publishers in a particular area, Branches are established; but until this is accomplished the territory where the witnessing is being done is assigned to the jurisdiction of a near-by Branch office so that someone will look after the interested, see that the brethren are supplied with literature, servants appointed and expansion carried on in that particular location. Under the United States Branch there are 17 countries or territories which report to the Brooklyn office because they have no Branch office of their own. The report shows that in these isolated places there are now 490 publishers reporting monthly, to compare with 295 last year. They have done well in the distribution of literature and have taken care of the good-will interest, increasing their back-calls from 29,221 to 50,692 in these 17 places. Book studies and public meetings also show marked increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Separated as these countries are in almost every conceivable way, such as by distance, language, arctic cold or equatorial heat, color and custom, they are nevertheless united in their praise of the Creator and are working harmoniously together with all of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world, promoting true worship. A brief report of what is going on in these 17 countries follows.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Work In this vast land, with Its widely scattered population, is greatly hampered by lack of transportation facilities. Because of this some of the special pioneers have found that they could accomplish more as general pioneers, working their way from place to place and talking the truth to all whom they meet. Their willingness to work has won them much respect, for the people have little use for the work-shy clergy. In this way they experience many joys, one of which is occasionally contacting old-time residents who have held tenaciously to truths learned years ago from a pioneer who worked throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the general lack of interest of the people whose time is taken up with making and spending the mammon of this world, the work is advancing. The average total number of publishers increased from 17 to 30, and there were Increases in placements and studies. The district assembly held in Juneau last June will undoubtedly do much toward even greater increases in the years ahead. This was the first time such an assembly had been held in Alaska with the president of the Society present to address the brethren and other interested people. It will take time, but the goodwill people will be gathered.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The majority of the people on these islands are humble and receptive toward the truth. With the exception of new subscriptions obtained, advances were made in every feature of the service. Opposition during the year, including false charges of “Communism” and efforts on the part of the officials to force the Gilead graduates to leave, has aroused much interest and has stimulated the brethren. The false charges were refuted in letters to the local papers as well as by the conduct and consistent ministerial work of the witnesses. Three new pioneers began full-time work and the average total number of publishers increased from 17 to 33. This little group of publishers conducted an average of 114 book studies each month, and made 6,123 back-calls. Each of the four missionaries averaged 20 book studies a week. The public meeting work is getting a start in the Bahamas with lectures being held in private homes. At one such meeting 20 were in attendance, 15 of whom were new interest. Efforts to concentrate on individual assistance for new publishers has been to a large degree responsible for the advances shown. A 94-percent increase in number of publishers in one year is excellent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past service year the people of Bermuda have learned about Jehovah’s witnesses. This has been accomplished through the house-to-house ministry of two Gilead graduates and four company publishers and also through the testimony given before the officials in this small island. The pioneers maintained an average of 189.2 hours, 126 back-calls and 21.2 book studies per month, in addition to spending considerable time in courtrooms and dealing with officials of the government.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6">Bermuda is a British possession and it was on that account that British graduates of Gilead were sent there in February, 1947. Although the Gilead graduates were British subjects, the Immigration authorities required a bond of £75 each before disembarkation. Representations were made to the Immigration Board and, after much correspondence, verbal consent was given for the missionary work to proceed. The pioneers were gladly received by the population and In a short while Bible studies were being held with upward of 100 persons. A congregation was organized in the capital city, Hamilton. The Christian ministry was appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, shortly afterward this consent was withdrawn pending further Investigations by the authorities with the attorney general. Later, the ministers were told to terminate their activities and leave the colony, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">but no reason was given.</span><span class="font6"> Since no reason was given, the ministers continued to serve their congregation. A magistrate’s court case arose out of this. The court agreed with the ministers’ argument and they were acquitted. Following this the Immigration Act was applied against the two young men, resulting in an adverse court decision and a conviction. A public petition was prepared with a view to a recognition of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it was signed by over 1,000 persons representing a complete cross-section of the population. But this petition brought no relief and no freedom of worship for Jehovah’s witnesses. The Bermuda House of Assembly refused to act to preserve freedom of worship for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was now decided by the Immigration Board to deport these two ministers. Finally, on September 26, after about 19 months’ ministerial work and after strenuous efforts had been made to preserve freedom of speech and worship, the two brethren, British subjects, were denied their rights as ministers of the gospel and were, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">without any explanation, </span><span class="font6">subjected to the ignominy of deportation from a British colony. There is not a scrap of evidence to show that this deportation was justifiable. It is evident that this was a special effort to get. Jehovah’s witnesses out of the colony, for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Royal Gazette,</span><span class="font6"> on September 29, 1948, reported that Portuguese subjects will be permitted to enter the colony. But Englishmen are deported!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The case is not finally settled, though the Bermuda authorities might think so. Jehovah’s witnesses are continuing the fight for their rights of worship. Representations are being made to members of the Parliament and to the secretary of the colonies in London, and Jehovah’s witnesses in Bermuda are working too for permission to have ministers enter Bermuda to take charge of the local congregation. The fight goes on! And the witness work proceeds in Bermuda, the publishers who remain seeing to it that the Kingdom message of hope is proclaimed in that colony for the benefit of the people of good-will. Already a great testimony has been given; everyone in Bermuda knows about Jehovah’s witnesses now. By the Lord’s grace, they shall learn more and more.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Despite many obstacles the brethren In Cameroun have made excellent progress in advancing the Kingdom interests in this West African country. During World War II the French authorities, acting under directions from the Vichy regime, imposed a ban on the activities of the few brethren in this land, seizing literature and instituting other oppressive measures. This ban has never been officially lifted, and the brethren still have difficulty in receiving literature. Religion has likewise shown its intolerance for the only message of real hope and truth. The chief of the subdivision of Mbanga in co-operation with the clergy has prohibited the preaching of the gospel, and because the brethren refused to cease this God-ordained work they were fined 10,000 francs for the “crime”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the first year that reports have been received from Cameroun, and every effort possible has been made to assist these brethren. A Nigerian pioneer was appointed to aid the newly-formed company at Douala, but only after great difficulty was he finally permitted to enter the country. Douala Is greatly overcrowded and crime Is rampant, and for this reason the French authorities have clamped down severely on the entry of aliens. With the better organization of the Douala company, reports for 81 publishers were received In August, and many more are eager to have a share in the work. The large volume of correspondence with this office on the part of people of good-will in Cameroun who wish to obtain more of the Society’s publications shows their appreciation for the truth of God’s Word. It is apparent that there is much Interest in Cameroun, and undoubtedly the Lord will make it possible for the work to progress.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year six more Gilead graduates were sent to this South American country, bringing their number to ten. Much Interest has been shown both in Quito, where a company is organized, and in Guayaquil. The consistent increase in good-will in Ecuador is shown by the Memorial report. This year 97 attended, and no one partook of the emblems, while last year only 67 were in attendance, with two partaking. What powerful evidence this is that the Lord Is gathering his “other sheep”! Think of it! Almost 100 at the Memorial gathering in this country and all are of the “other sheep” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was an average of 42 book studies being held with persons of good-will, and many of them are seeing the privilege of participating in the field service. A new peak of 32 company publishers was reached In August. While there is a constant turnover as to Individuals with whom studies are held &gt;-s some give up when opposed by friends and relatives, new ones are always found to take their places. Back-calls showed a good increase, from last year’s 2,397 to 4,404. With the added help of the newly-arrived special pioneers and the good start that the local publishers have made in ministering to others, the prospects for further advances in Ecuador seem good indeed, especially when we have 107-percent increase in publishers!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The workers here, though few in number, are very zealous and desire to serve God in spirit and in truth. It was only recently that a small group, having fled persecution In French and Belgian Congo, began to gather together in French Equatorial Africa. Here they heard of the truth from a brother who helped them start in Kingdom service in 1947. Their great joy has resulted in a rapid advance in the work, despite the fact that they are new and have had very little Instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An application for a company organization at Kenzinga in Oubangui-Chari has been received and there are at least nine other interested groups scattered throughout the territory. One publisher has gone many miles into the Interior to assist another group to get organized. Ten publishers are taking an active part In the work and many persons of good-will accompany them in group witnessing. It is not uncommon for them to travel many kilometers on foot to make a back-call. Reports received for the months of June and July indicate that public studies are sometimes held three times a week, occasionally with over one hundred in attendance. The majority of those associated are intelligent and well-educated Africans who also speak the French language and work for the government or commercial firms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is hoped that Gilead graduates can soon be sent to help these meek people. Indeed, they are already calling for the assistance of a circuit servant even before their companies are organized! There is good reason to believe that the work will go ahead here with great speed, as the people readily recognize the difference between the truth and the husks handed them by the aloof white missionaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This little island in the Caribbean is well acquainted with the need for freedom. Originally held by the Spanish and then alternately by the French and British, the Island was the scene of much suffering and misery due to the enslavement of its colored inhabitants. Emancipation of slaves in 1848 brought welcome relief, but today, one hundred years later, the people are still enslaved by religion and ignorance. Education lags far behind and living costs are high, much to the hindrance of any who seek to be really free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Leading the fight for true and complete freedom of worship in Guadeloupe are three pioneers and an ever-increasing number of company publishers. Their combined average number grew from 13 to 28 since last year, although a peak of 46 publishers was reached In March. There are now two companies, one at the principal seaport, Pointe-a-Pitre, and a new one at Sainte-Rose. Although these sincere servants of Jehovah are greatly in need of the assistance of trained pioneers, they are pushing ahead with gospel-preaching and doing the best they can, with the result that back-calls jumped from 257 to 1,373 and book studies from an average of 1 to 33 each month. Modern slaveholders, the clergy, have shown their dislike for this work of emancipation, and on one occasion the local priest rang the church bells for half an hour to try to prevent the holding of a public meeting. However, Jehovah has blessed this feature of the work too, for the number of meetings held has grown from 2 last year to 44.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">One special pioneer, a Gilead graduate, is now reporting regularly and endeavoring to forward the Kingdom interests in Iceland. A considerable amount of the time of this special publisher has been devoted to translating work, but the availability of literature in Icelandic should prove a boon to the people of this land. They read a great many books and it is not difficult to place literature with the older folks, although the younger people have little use for the Bible. Although the people are kind, spiritism is common and the majority believe in dreams. Two pioneers who were formerly working in Iceland have now gone to Newfoundland, but it is hoped that more assistance can soon be sent to Iceland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been good progress in the back-call work, with 651 reported, to compare with 443 for the previous year. The first public talk ever given by Jehovah’s witnesses in Iceland was held in Reykjavik on November 30, with 60 Interested persons present. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> book in Icelandic was received just tn time for the talk, and 25 copies were placed with those in attendance. The work in Iceland is being built on a firm foundation as seeds of truth continue to be planted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>LEBANON AND SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Lebanon and Syria has suffered from -the upheaval In Palestine. The clergy have taken advantage of the war to bring false accusations against the brethren, claiming them to be Jewish propagandists engaged in political activity. The homes of some of the brethren were searched and they were subjected to questioning. A friendly gendarme later told them, “Everything you were accused of turned out to be the opposite. I would like to pay you a visit sometime to know more about God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the morning of Memorial 350 assembled 10 miles north of Tripoli and after a short Bible discourse nearly half took part in field service, zealously working many towns and villages covering an area of 20 miles and placing an abundance of literature In the hands of the people. A public meeting later In the day was Interrupted by Lebanese police due to pressure from the Greek Orthodox </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hierarchy, </span><span class="font6">but the brethren were able to gather in the evening for the Memorial celebration. At this meeting and another at Beirut a total of 275 assembled, with 6 partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Particularly noteworthy was the increase in public meetings. There were 52 held this year, but not without opposition from the enemy. On several occasions there were riots at public meetings at the instigation of the clergy. As a result many persons of good-will have openly declared themselves for The Theocracy. Recently six members of a religious organization, “Jehoud el Iman” (Soldiers of the Faith), which has been persecuting the brethren, were baptized and they are now actively participating In the service. The doubling of back-calls and book studies over the previous year shows that there are many who sigh and cry because of the abominations being committed in this unhappy land and they turn readily to the truth. Two of the seven pioneers are Gilead graduates and they continue to take the lead in preaching and teaching others in the ministry. Like many other places in the world, there still is need for many more workers in this great harvest field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the past service year this country’s first company was organized at Sinoe county, Liberia. The company publishers have been diligent in letting their light shine; for they averaged 20.9 hours, 7.9 back-calls and 1 book study per month during the year. Undoubtedly this played a share in the Increase in average number of publishers from 3 to 9, with a peak of 15 in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are two special pioneers In Monrovia. Although they have encountered many handicaps, they have joyfully pushed on without complaining and Jehovah has added many blessings for them. Monrovia Is a congested city with people living as many as 30 families in a house and 6 to 20 families in a hut. There are few streets and no house numbers, and, since the people are continually moving, it is difficult to contact them for back-calls and book studies. In spite of this, 1,935 back-calls were made in Liberia last year and an average of 17 book studies conducted monthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that 28 different dialects are spoken in Liberia, 13 in Monrovia alone, and those who speak one dialect usually cannot converse in another. Ninety-five percent of the people are Illiterate, mostly aborigines. It Is difficult to witness under these circumstances. Some success has been had by showing the pictures In the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font6"> to those who can understand a smattering of English and endeavoring to explain the Kingdom to them in this manner. The special pioneers have been making good</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">progress in learning the most commonly used dialect and have expressed the hope of someday mastering all of them! This should be an incentive to any who are striving to learn one language to better fit themselves for gospelpreaching.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Netherlands West Indies boasts of unlimited religious freedom, and for the most part this freedom has been enjoyed by our brethren. There has been sporadic interference on the part of uninformed policemen, but thus far their complaints have not been heeded by the authorities. The San Nicolas, Aruba company, one of the two in this country, recently obtained a Kingdom Hall, and the good effects have already been felt there. Especially has It aided them with their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study and public meetings. There were 63 public meetings held this year, to compare with 18 for the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The street work has been carried on with excellent results and there was a good Increase In number of individual magazines placed and subscriptions obtained. In fact, every feature of the work has shown progress. This activity has resulted In concern among the clergy. The priests make a lot of noise and tell the people that our books are too cheap to be of any good; but apparently their fuming is not taken too seriously, as 6,630 books and 8,691 booklets were placed during the year. The publishers were happy to receive the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> in Dutch, and the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> was recently printed in the United States in Papiamento, the language spoken by the majority of these people. These publications will greatly assist them to preach the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ion noho (good</span><span class="font6"> news) of the Kingdom in this territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Reports have been received for only 10 months from this strife-torn land and the brethren have been scattered, some to Lebanon and Syria, others to Egypt. Two Russian pioneers who were working in Jerusalem are believed to have been taken captive by the Jews, and the whereabouts of many other publishers is not known. The work in Palestine had been showing excellent progress, largely due to Brother Knorr’s visit to that land, so, even with incomplete reports for this service year, an increase is shown in everything but literature placements. The brethren who have remained in Palestine are still endeavoring to witness to the people, often at the risk of their lives. Food, clothing and shelter are often Impossible to obtain and, due to the disrupted conditions, Jobs are not to be had. The brethren have tried to keep in touch with the Society, expressing heartfelt thanks for letters which have been a source of strength and encouragement to them. Their trust is in the Lord and they are confidently looking forward to the end of present troubles in their land so that they may witness with greater effect. To this end they are preparing themselves through study and are preaching at every opportunity even though dispersed much the same as were the early Christians.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In this second year of organized activity in Peru, the blessing of Jehovah has been manifest and prospects for future growth are good. The number of special publishers has been Increased from 8 to 13. Throughout the year these Gilead graduates maintained the splendid average of 67 back-calls per month and 10.9 book studies. This consistent effort on behalf of good-will people resulted In an Increase in the average total number of publishers from 22 to 40. The increased activity which resulted from the formation of a company at Huancayo aroused the Ire of some “protestant” religious groups. Even so, at the beginning of the year only one publisher was reporting from Huancayo but latest reports show five active publishers. The group was assisted by one of the Gilead-trained missionaries who visited them during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More graduates from Gilead were sent to Peru during the year. Lima, the capital, should be well served during 1949 service year, and we hope there will soon be enough ministers to send into other cities in the land of the Incas.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A promise was made in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> report last year, “Every possible form of assistance that the Society can provide will be given to the brethren in Portugal during the coming year.” Now the publishers in that land can look back on the year and can appreciate that the promise was fulfilled. Many subscriptions for both magazines are being sent free to Portuguese readers. Scores of packets of literature have been sent free, and more are entering the country. A good stock of Kingdom truth is being piled up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A graduate of Gilead has had the opportunity of helping in the organization of the service work, and, best of all, three personal visits were made by Brothers Knorr and Henschel to Portugal during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These three visits were not very long, but they were made on three different occasions during Brother Knorr’s trip to South Africa. The first visit took place December 13. A two-day visit was scheduled, but bad flying conditions delayed the plane and the first visit resolved itself to a stay of just several hours with the brethren in Lisbon. However, from 1 a.m. until 8 a.m. the two visitors had an enjoyable time answering questions. A few days later, on their return from Madrid, several days were spent in Lisbon, helping in the organization of the work. These two visits, though very brief, did much good. They helped to establish closer unity among the Lisbon brethren. In 1933 there was a small Branch in operation in Lisbon, but since then the brethren have lacked that dynamic, impelling force that Jehovah accords through His organization. The third visit took place on January 19. It was just a brief stop when Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel were returning from their African tour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since these visits the brethren have reported regularly. There has been an average number of 10 publishers in the field, reaching a peak of 14 in August; and 2,381 pieces of literature have been distributed. Portugal is a Catholic country, and religion is strongly entrenched with government support. But the brethren visiting the people of the country in their house-to-house work find them interested in Bible study, and good progress is now being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August it was possible to have a Gilead graduate visit not only the brethren in Lisbon but also those in northern Portugal. This was greatly appreciated by all the brethren. At Memorial time there was a meeting in the city of Almada, with 50 in attendance. Now there is an average of 45 at the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study. Since the Gilead graduate arrived, meetings are being conducted more in accordance with the Society’s method. Service meetings have been started; the back-call work is getting under way, and the brethren are lining up with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most of the people are kindly and courteous. Illiteracy runs about 40 percent, and homes possessing a Bible are the exception rather than the rule. Nevertheless, there are many of good-will in the country. Surely some of the eight million population will be of the meek who shall inherit the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This little country of about 4,000 square miles, located on the west coast of Africa just north of the equator, was transferred to the United States Branch following Brother Knorr’s visit to Africa during the year. Although extremely fertile and productive, the country’s economic progress has been retarded by the deadly nature of its climate, particularly to Europeans. This has proved to be an obstacle in the path of its Theocratic progress as well. The natives are inclined to move slowly and the special publishers have been dogged by the heat and fever. There is one company at the capital, Freetown, and some progress is being made. The local publishers are taking a greater part in the back-call activity and this feature of the service in particular has advanced. The distribution of magazines is also increasing as the publishers learn the value of this means of making known the Kingdom’s blessings. They are doing what they can in Sierra Leone, and we feel sure that continued effort will in God’s due time bring forth Kingdom fruits as luxurious as those of the plantations and forests of this productive land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Is there a more Catholic country than Spain? From the viewpoint of church power, It is probably the chief Catholic stronghold in the world. A large portion of the population is only nominally Catholic, but the supremacy of the Church is unquestionable. Since 1936, when the Branch office of the Society was closed, long years of lack of contact and organization, civil war and general misery left the Spanish Held in a very neglected and disorderly condition. The visit of Brothers Franz and Covington in 1947 was the first infusion of new life into the Spanish work. Interest was found, but no organization went Into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In December, 1947, Brother Knorr, Brother Henschel and a Gilead graduate arrived in Madrid from Brooklyn. This marked the opening of a new chapter of Kingdom service In Spain. Study meetings were arranged; service instructions were given, and the Gilead graduate was left in Spain to carry on the organizational work. Difficulties that had arisen among the brethren were straightened out; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies and book studies were begun, and visits were made to all Interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Barcelona is perhaps the best field for Kingdom service in the whole of Spain. Bible meetings are held in private homes; back-calls are made and studies begun; and the house-to-house preaching, which is a risky business, is carried on only by experienced brethren. “Wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” is the advice for Spanish publishers. Even though there are only 34 publishers reporting for this year the work has aroused many priests who have seen to it that notice has been put in the newspapers concerning protestant activity. Even radio broadcasts have been made concerning the activity of just these few people who are promoting true worship. The police are on the lookout for “trouble”, as they call it, and the priests are fearful that the members of their flocks might hear something about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To give just one Incident that occurred: The Gilead graduate was visiting a small town In the north of Spain. Along with the company servant, he decided to visit an isolated publisher In a small mountain village. Somehow or other the priest heard of this visit. When the two visitors arrived at the house, the priest had already been there with four civil guards. The brethren were arrested at pistol point and taken back to the nearest town for examination by police officers. This examination continued all night until 5 a.m. The main charge was that of holding a meeting, but our brethren put up the defense that It was Impossible for them to have had a meeting because the arrest took place before they even went Into the house. This statement was Ignored. However, a good witness was given to the police, the jailer and the squad of soldiers who were set on guard. After two days the brethren were released, and on that very same day the brethren went back to that small village and finished their visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now there are eight small companies organized in Spain. The Memorial was celebrated, with 96 in attendance and 18 partakers. Literature is continually fed into the hands of the brethren in small packages. Thousands of leaflets were specially printed by the Society for the Spanish field. The brethren were delighted to get these and used discretion in distributing them wisely in their territories. The people In Spain groan under the heavy yoke of dictatorship and many are aware of the hypocrisy and commercialism of the national religion. With such persons the Kingdom message finds ready acceptance. This tiny band of Kingdom publishers in Spain will continue, by the Lord’s grace, to sing Jehovah’s praises. They are anxious to share In the great expansion program.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The religious ministers and priests have been very negligent of the people on these islands, many of whom are extremely poverty-stricken. These meek people have therefore welcomed the truth from those who do not preach for hire, and advances have been made into the religious “pastures”. There are now five special pioneers, two on the island of St. Croix and three on St. Thomas. During the past year they had a monthly average of over 22 book studies and 100 back-calls each. This conscientious labor In the harvest fields of Jehovah brought forth good fruit, as the average number of publishers in the Islands Increased from 17 to 32. While the service averages of the company publishers are rather low, they have reported regularly and will undoubtedly improve as they receive more training. The work has been hampered considerably by the lack of a suitable centrally located meeting-place, but public meetings are being held and the presence of the witnesses is being felt. One secular paper reported that due to the “chronic lethargy” of the clergy and the zealous work of the witnesses “deeper inroads can be expected”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work of praising Jehovah is indeed a blessed one, and more persons of good-will are appreciating this fact in Argentina and joining the ranks of songsters who are singing His praises in that nation. The publishers in this Catholic-dominated, Spanish-speaking country increased their ranks by 36 percent during the 1948 service year and now have an average of 927 active ministers. They have increased in every field of service, making big advances in their hours, back-calls and book studies. In 1946 they had an average of 489; in 1947 they averaged 679; and in the past year, 927, with a new peak of 1,033.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren in Argentina fully appreciate that their territory has not been witnessed to completely. Only the surface has been scratched. A number of large cities have not been worked for several years, and the rural territories have not been reached either. The ministers of the Kingdom in Argentina are looking for more workers, not to do their work, but to help them in the expansion work. The brethren in Argentina rejoice in what has been done, and the Branch servant has sent in a very interesting report. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the last few years the increase has been constant, especially since Brother Knorr’s visit in 1945. When the question was put to the assembled brethren at the time of his visit as to how many had been Catholics before getting the truth, almost the whole congregation lifted their hands. From then on came the appreciation that from among the millions of Catholics in this country there were to be found some of the Lord’s “other sheep”. It is to Jehovah that we give the praise for the privilege of reaching so many, but we know that there are more hungry ones who must be fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest help in the gathering work has been the Lord’s blessing in bringing more pioneers into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More hours spent In the field service by more publishers means that many more persons of good-will can be found. The Society’s new arrangement, making special provision for pioneers, has been appreciated here in Argentina. Sixty-one pioneers are now singing Jehovah’s praises. True, the goal of 10 percent has not been attained as yet in this country, but those who have shown their determination to work in this field are moving others to join them. Some said a year ago that the pioneer work was impossible for them, but now these same ones are taking the lead in the pioneer service, and the company publishers in turn are being moved by the zeal shown by the pioneers. The brethren appreciate the need of dedicating more of their time to preaching this gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is a marvelous provider. The circuit assembly arrangement which was started last year has caused a great witness to be given in some of our larger cities. Announcing public meetings by the use of sandwich signs is really an unusual sight in Argentina. This has moved many a passer-by to inquire of the witness what it Is all about. Circuit activity meetings have been very instructive and helpful. The brethren, too, are being better equipped through the Theocratic ministry course, and through this training public meetings can properly be handled, and this activity is being stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One field for expansion which was given more attention this year by the publishers was that of street witnessing. This is the reason why some 8,000 more magazines were placed during this year than last. The main streets in the capital city, Buenos Aires, are now being regularly and correctly worked. We pray that the Lord of the harvest may send more laborers, because the field indeed is ripe, but the workers few. We are grateful to the Lord for the blessings received, and we wish to express our gratitude to all the brethren who have supported the work and to all of you in Brooklyn for the splendid co-operation given. Our singing voices are with yours always.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The district assemblies held in Australia seem to have given real stimulus to the work there. The brethren are forgetting the past and have their minds set on one interest, that of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. The pioneer work is expanding. On the average there was a 6^-percent increase in total number of publishers in the field above last year, and a peak of publishers was reached, of 3,723, for the 1948 service year. It has been a most joyful year for the brethren in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The printing plant the Society has in that country has been doing good work, too. 176,000 copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font7"> were printed; 212,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations </span><span class="font7">were produced, and it is their hope to shortly put out the new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> in the Malay language. The Branch servant sends in an interesting report, and he says that the publishers are “strong and of good courage”. Excerpts from his report show this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Australia is well known for her sheep. In fact, with a population of 125,000,000 “woollies”, she leads the world. And it is becoming known, too, that she has a steadily increasing number of the Lord’s “other sheep” within her bounds. This past year has added to the number. On the average, over 200 more publishers reported every month than did last year. A joyful, eager spirit prevails among the brethren. The Lord’s spirit is flowing freely. It gives me great pleasure to make this report on the progress of Jehovah’s work in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The district assemblies were by far the most refreshing events of the year. Six of these were held in five of the nation’s six states. All of Australia comprises only one district but it was necessary to arrange for several assemblies because of the long distances of travel involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the people of good-will attended the various sessions of the assembly and enjoyed the service talks just as much as the public talk. One said, “I did enjoy the assembly. My only regret is that I was not present for every session.” Another book study attendant, after attending several assembly sessions, voluntarily stated to the publisher who studies with her, “I am going out in the service with you next week.” A Catholic man who was attending for the first time heard the three talks on “Improving Our Ministry”. Afterward, his face beaming with joy, he stated to a brother, “No other organization has a chance to stand against you people. I am going home to try to persuade my wife to attend the public talk this afternoon.” At the Melbourne, Victoria, assembly a sister pleaded with the lady she studies with to come to the public lecture. Imagine the sister’s joy when this “sheep” not only came along herself but brought seven neighbors with her!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The assemblies were largely responsible for our year’s peak of 3,723 publishers reached in August. Also, a marked Increase has been shown In company meeting attendance throughout the nation. Truly, Jehovah is the author of assemblies, and to him we give all thanks and praise for the Increase wrought through these district assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In February the new arrangement for pioneers with the quota of 120 hours per month was announced. This has been hailed with joyful appreciation by veteran pioneers and by the great number of new ones who have enrolled as a direct result of the lowered hour-quota. One veteran writes: “I would like to express my sincere appreciation of the Lord’s new arrangement through his organization for the general pioneers. Owing to bad health I had intended to go off the pioneer list, but now I will be able to continue.” Another sister who has spent years in the full-time service says: “I now feel that there are many happy years of pioneering ahead for me, for which I give thanks to our loving heavenly Father, who knows all our needs and who has made this grand new arrangement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But now to hear from a new pioneer: “Having just completed six months in the pioneer service under the new arrangement, I would like to express my appreciation of this wonderful provision of the Lord. Many have been my joyful experiences, and I hope, by the Lord’s grace, to be able to continue in full-time work until the witness work ceases at Armageddon.” Still another writes: “I wish to give thanks to Jehovah and his organization for this new provision made for pioneers. Indeed it is wonderful to see the way Jehovah works through his ‘servant’ on earth in pushing the advance of true worship.” Another sister sends in her third month’s report and says: “It is with great joy that I send in this report. It has been a hard month, but Jehovah gives' us many rich blessings. Three different ones from my studies started out in the grand expansion work this month, and three others are starting next month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At least two pioneer groups report that since they have taken on part-time secular work their witnessing activities have made </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a far</span><span class="font6"> greater impression on the people. The reason is that the people actually see them earning their own livelihood and no longer believe this is a “bookselling racket”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the new arrangement was announced only seven months ago 88 new pioneers have enrolled. Last February there were only 150 reporting. As I write this report there are 238 enrolled and the applications still continue to come In.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord continues to richly bless the public meeting work. We have found that holding public meetings in private homes is quite successful, especially in the rurals. In one locality a servant to the brethren called back where the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> book had been placed. After a discussion on the book the man was Invited to attend the public talk the following Sunday. He said, “I cannot come, but why not arrange for a talk in my home?” This was readily agreed to. He then suggested: “I will ring all the neighbors up on the phone and get them to come along.” This he did, and the result was 15 strangers in attendance, including a Seventh-Day Adventist pastor. From the island state of Tasmania the servant to the brethren reports the following: “At Telita, the local hall was blown down in a storm. However, a newly Interested lady who was a Roman Catholic arranged to have the lecture in the home of her neighbors who were also Catholics. She then came round to all the homes with me, eagerly telling the people of the wonderful message that was to be delivered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An experience comes to hand about an Incapacitated sister who advertised for pen friends in order to witness to them by mail. Among those replying was a young girl living on an isolated sheep station ’way out in the “never-never”. She became interested In the truth and kept up the correspondence. That was six years ago. Eventually she started studies in her home with other members of her family. The result has been that this young lady became a pioneer last August, and her mother and brother recently attended their first circuit assembly and were immersed. Interesting too is the fact that this sister and the sister who first witnessed to her by mail met each other for the first time at the Sydney district assembly this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year four more graduates of Gilead school arrived. One of these, an Australian brother, came back in September and has been working in the Branch office. The other three, who are Canadian brethren, arrived in February and have been serving as servants to the brethren. The training and experience in organizational procedure possessed by these brethren sent out from the Society’s school aids greatly in the work and is much appreciated by the brethren. A total of six Gilead graduates are now serving in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are determined during the new service year to expand our ministry still further, as we join with our fellow publishers throughout the earth in saying: “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” All the brethren join me in sending love and greetings to you, Brother Knorr, and to our brethren world-wide.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>FIJI</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Australian Branch office directs the expansion of the work in several countries in the Far East. Among the territories handled by this Branch are the Fiji islands, Singapore, Malaya and the United States of Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this vast region are thousands of beautiful islands whose inhabitants speak many different tongues. On the Fiji islands the population is a mixture of Indians and Fijians. There are also some Europeans there. The principal languages spoken are Fijian, English and Hindustani. The bulk of the English literature that is placed by the missionaries goes into the homes of the Indian folk; however, it is very difficult to start studies with the Indians. It may be that they are so steeped in their religion that they refuse to hearken to the word of Jehovah. But that does not stop Jehovah’s witnesses from preaching. They must continue until this gospel is proclaimed in all the world for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to the Fijian, he is anxious to hear the truth and is a ready listener. It is difficult for the missionary to try to convey his thoughts in the Fijian and Hindustani languages, but a good missionary will try to learn the language of the people with whom he lives so that he may be a good minister to them. The same is true in the territories of Singapore and Malaya. Here our fellow workers have to know a little Chinese, Malayan and different Indian languages as well as English. The total population of Malaya is 5,867,000, and 2,130,000 of these are Malayan. The Chinese are next in number, with 1,880,000. There are but few Europeans. So it can easily be seen that the bulk of the work must be done with the Malayans, Chinese and Indians. In the United States of Indonesia there are more problems as to language, customs, and the way of life of the people in general. Reports from these countries follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sure signs that the expansion work is on are the experiences we often hear of how the message is being spread, not only to the islands within the Fiji group but to many surrounding island groups as well. Interested persons have taken the publications to such islands in the Pacific area as Samoa, Tonga, Rotuma, Ellice and the Solomons. The following two experiences bear out this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the Gilead brothers made a back-call upon a Roman Catholic woman with whom he had placed a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book. This person did not show much interest, but on another day when he was in the neighborhood he decided to call again. Imagine his surprise when the husband of the woman invited him inside, telling him that he had thoroughly read the book. He had already been teaching the book’s contents to others on another island! His listeners there were now so eager to learn more of God’s Word that they had asked for the two Gilead graduates to visit them. A book study has been started with this person of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the last five months the other Gilead brother has been studying with a man of good-will, an Ellicean of the Ellice islands. A few weeks ago this man told the brother that he would shortly be going home for a year’s vacation, and that during that time he is going to translate the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book into the local vernacular as well as into the Samoan language. He added: “This is for the benefit of my fellow countrymen so that I can witness to them. It is my duty to God to do so.” This person is one of the official interpreters working in the high commissioner’s office. He left Fiji three weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We held 14 public meetings during the service year. Average attendance at each meeting was 34, and an average of 22 of these were strangers. Through the medium of one of these meetings we have an additional publisher. This person of good-will came by plane from England to settle here. She was associated with our English brethren. While advertising a public lecture one Saturday morning a Gilead publisher handed this person a handbill. He noted that she took unusual interest in its contents; so his curiosity was aroused. Three days later his curiosity was satisfied when he met this “sheep” at her new home in his territory. She attended the next public meeting. From that time onward she has also attended the company meetings, and is now publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord is certainly using the street magazine work to give a world-wide witness. Suva is a seaport town and is the capital of Fiji. It also has an airport near by. Therefore it becomes a place where people call in from many different countries of the world, especially those traveling from New Zealand and Australia to America and Canada and vice versa. We meet these people when on the streets, as well as the crews of ships from Europe and Asia. Often while street witnessing these people stop and tell us that they have met the witnesses on the streets in Canada, England, Australia, America or New Zealand, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine is popular with many in this colony. Some time ago an Indian newspaper called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Samachar</span><span class="font6"> published word for word the article on “Cremation” from the November 22, 1947, issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We here in Fiji rejoice with our brethren world-wide in being Jehovah’s people for the Issue and in being able to ‘sing his praise among the nations’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">From the beginning of the year to the end thereof Jehovah’s blessings have been manifest upon his people. Soon after the service year started the colonial secretary’s office advised us that all restrictions that had been imposed upon our publications during the war were now rescinded. Additionally, the Immigration Department cleared up the difficulty encountered eighteen months ago by the two Gilead graduates upon arrival in Singapore by granting them an unconditional entry into the colony. Thus the “stones” were gathered out of the way leading to expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief difficulty experienced by the Singapore company was the lack of a suitable meeting-place, necessitating the holding of meetings in a brother’s home located in an out-of-the-way neighborhood. Nearly all schools and halls are operated by religious missions, which made it seem impossible to obtain one for use as a Kingdom Hall. However, our petition to Him “that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think” was answered and we were provided with a Kingdom Hall. A Bible study had been held for some time with two schoolteachers who were associated with a mission. Consequently they left that school and opened up a private school of their own. Theirs is a large building and centrally located in our territory. This school they have granted to us rent-free for the use of the company as a meeting-place for regular and public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Good success was achieved with our public meeting series. An interesting feature of these talks has been the advertising. All placards were drawn and painted In the abovementioned school by the art class as part of their course. In addition to the placard and handbill work, a brother who works in a department that controls all advertising in the city was able to get three theaters in the vicinity to run regular advertisements on the screen free of charge. The press also has given free space for announcing our public talks. Thus an effective public witness to the Kingdom was given in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The admonition to “welcome the stranger” at the public meetings has brought good results, as the following experience shows. A friendly chat with one newcomer resulted In a back-call’s being made at his home and a book study started the second time visited. This person was reared as a Presbyterian but became dissatisfied with that group because favor was shown to the rich and influential members of the congregation and the poorer ones were neglected. (See James 2:1-7.) After trying other denominations, he became despondent of the “Christian” sects because of their lack of true Christian spirit and because of the existing confusion in their doctrines and teaching. He was then persuaded by a friend to join the Mohammedan religion. Years later a copy of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine was given him at his office by a Catholic subscriber. This aroused his interest, sending him in search of our meeting-place, which he located during one of the public talks. For the past six months a book study has been held in his home. He has distributed some of the books among his office friends, and even obtained a copy of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font6"> to help him convince his Catholic friend that there is no such thing as the “trinity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On instruction from the Brooklyn office, the two Gilead brethren paid a visit to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya, in response to an invitation from the interested persons there. Two public meetings were held, one in the Kuala Ltimpur town hall, with 32 present, and another at Batu Caves, where 12 attended. Thus it is seen that a goodly number of “sheep” were located and aided during this brief two-week visit. One sister living some distance out of Kuala Lumpur will endeavor to call on some of the interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is yet much work to be done in Malaya. This is a territory for real missionary work, as much of It has never been touched with the Kingdom message. It rejoices our heart to hear that additional Gilead workers may soon be sent here, because “the harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>UNITED STATES OF INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For many years a handicap to the work in Indonesia has been the shortage of literature. There are four principal languages spoken in these islands, namely, Malay, Hollandish, Chinese and English. The population consists of sixty million Indonesians, one quarter million Europeans, one and a half million Chinese, and about one hundred thousand other Asiatics. We are thankful to say that the literature shortage Is now being overcome. Recently the Society has been able to ship a large quantity of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font6"> in Hollandish to Java via Singapore. The brethren are overjoyed to receive this much-needed aid to their gospel-preaching. The language spoken by the majority of the Indonesians is a local Malay. During the past year the brethren there have translated the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, </span><span class="font6">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nations”</span><span class="font6"> booklet into this language, and it is now ready for printing here at Strathfield. Also, the Malay translation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> has just been completed and this will shortly be printed. Thus, by the Lord’s grace, the problem of a lack of literature Is being overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Good news indeed is the fact that we have just received pioneer applications from the Batavia company servant and his wife. There are prospects for two more pioneers, too, as another brother and a sister are contemplating joining the pioneer ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Placing literature in the hands of the people often brings good results even when the person contributing for it doesn’t read it. The following Is an example: A young Eurasian who was in the Dutch army and stationed at Medan, Sumatra, purchased the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> from a secondhand store. Upon reading the book he began to see the difference between the truth as contained in the Bible and the false doctrines taught by the various sects of Christendom. Fired with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, he then went so far as to give testimony concerning the truth to some of his superiors in the army. After being demobilized and settling in Batavia, he saw one of the booklets in his aunt’s home one day. In it he found the Society’s new address and wrote again. This time the contact was made, a back-call resulted, and this “sheep” now attends the meetings in Dutch. The truth never depreciates in value and effectiveness even though found in a secondhand store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has done its utmost to help the publishers in Java to spread the good news of the Kingdom, and this the brethren greatly appreciate. There Is much work yet to be done in this vast territory embraced by the United States of Indonesia, and it is hoped that eventually some Gilead missionaries may be sent to aid with the preaching work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The general conditions in Austria are much better than they were a year ago; however, they are still difficult and awkward for the people. In December the government issued new money, and everyone had to exchange his old currency. Most European countries have gone through this exchange, and it has always caused a general shortage of money for a period of time. In spite of the many hindrances and hardships in the normal way of life, the brethren have pushed on faithfully with the proclamation of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A marvelous increase has been seen in the number of publishers, and there were six consecutive new peaks throughout the year in the ranks of the ministers of the gospel. The highest peak came in July, when 1,552 reported time in field service. On the average throughout the entire year there was a 71-percent increase in number of publishers over last year. This certainly has thrilled the brethren, and it makes them feel the need all the more of preaching the gospel, because there are so many people of goodwill taking their stand. Company organizations have increased from 90 to 129.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are seeking the new world want to assemble together and have the joy of fellowship. They know that the old world holds nothing for them except rations, small ones at that, and a black market that few people can buy from. What comfort the truth is to those who seek righteousness! The Branch servant’s report gives us the true feeling of the brethren in Austria, and portions of it are reprinted here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the field work the brethren meet some opposition. In some cases the clergy send to the police to stop the brethren, but in most cases the brethren could carry on after identifying themselves. There were instances when the policemen asked: “Did you say Jehovah’s witnesses? Are you the same as the Bible students with whom we were in concentration camp?” Of course, the brethren confirmed this, and when-the police officers were convinced, they said: “Oh, those were the finest men we ever met. You carry on with your work and nobody has a right to stop you.” On the other hand, there are a few cases where the police acted against the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another way of giving a witness to many people Is at funerals. The clergy frequently tell the people that they would be buried like dogs if they join Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus many people are curious to see what our funerals are like, and a brother wrote us the following experience: “I had the privilege to speak at the funeral of a brother who had suffered terribly. His wife is also a sister. Her relatives pressed her hard to wear a black veil, but, of course, she refused to do so. She was brave and did not weep. Many of the fellow workers of the brother had come to the funeral, and when we arrived at the cemetery there were about 120 people gathered to hear the funeral talk. The exposition of some scriptures regarding the dead, hell, soul, resurrection and the new world, was a true consolation for many. At the end I mentioned with few words that everybody who wants to know more about these vital things may ask Jehovah’s witnesses. Behold, 25 persons came the same evening to the sister, the wife of the brother who had died, to hear more about the truth. She distributed between them all literature she had, books, booklets and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span><span class="font6"> It was already nine o’clock that evening when a neighbor knocked, and asked the sister if she would come to his house as there are several people gathered who have many questions about the Bible. Probably public lectures will be held in that village soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some weeks ago we moved into our new home, where we have more space and the work can be done more efficiently. The house was hit by a bomb, but the restoration is almost finished. In a few weeks all the bedrooms will be ready and then we can settle down to real Bethel life. Our new place Is in a central district of Vienna, and we are very thankful to have nice rooms to work in. Often we had almost given up hope ever to find anything suitable for our purpose. Thus our appreciation is now all the greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The zeal and courage of the Austrian brethren was certainly influenced by the great help we received again this year from our brethren in the United States and Canada. We distributed ten tons of clothing and shoes, and more than 1,300 CARE packages. All these nice and good things came just at a time when they were needed most, namely, in winter. The CARE packages were specially packed for .Jehovah’s witnesses and their contents could not have been better chosen for the conditions here. Both these packages and the large amount of clothing were a great encouragement for all of us, as we saw in them a visible fulfillment of the promises God’s Word gives us with regard to our bodily needs, if only we are faithful. From all quarters the brethren asked us to convey their love and deep appreciation to you, dear Brother Knorr, and to all the dear brethren on the other side of the great water. The bonds of love and unity among the Lord’s people are stronger than ever, and. by Jehovah’s grace and mercy, we will unitedly lift up his royal Signal, that more and more people of good-will may join us in singing his praises.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the service year Jehovah’s praisers in Belgium responded enthusiastically to the call to sing forth. The result has been that the song of praise has increased mightily in volume in the land of the Walloons and Flemings. In the 1947 service year the workers did not attain a 10-percent increase in number of publishers, but in the service year just past all were fully determined to reach their quota. With the circuit assemblies well organized during the year and with two district assemblies to accommodate all the brethren, the forward march was on to aid people of good-will in the field service. A 34-percent increase in number of publishers has been realized, with new peaks eight months out of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the assemblies were enthusiastically supported by the publishers and many persons of good-will. At the two district assemblies the public meeting attendance totaled 1,960. It was estimated that 1,100 were brethren and the rest strangers. One newspaper, commenting on the conference of the witnesses of Jehovah, referred to the gigantic signs and the great distribution of handbills and how Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their work in general, saying, “The meeting of the Watch Tower Society could not pass unperceived. ‘Go through the midst of the city,’ it is written in the gospel. To this mission the divine witnesses do not want to fail.” From the Branch servant’s report w<sup>r</sup>e can see that Jehovah’s witnesses in Belgium are ‘going through the city’ and doing the ‘marking’ work. A few of their experiences are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 3 more graduates from Gilead arrived in Belgium, making a total of 4 for this country. The brethren have greatly appreciated the instruction and help given by the publishers from Gilead, and they have been a great help In pushing the expansion of true worship. We hope that it will be possible to send some more during this coming year, especially to work In the Flemish territory. There is a large field here where thousands of persons of good-will are sighing and crying because of the abominations practiced In Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy much freedom in Belgium in spite of the fact chat the Catholic religion predominates, which religion is noted for its opposition to Bible education. The Belgian people in general are liberty-loving and kindly disposed; it is really a pleasure to visit them with the Kingdom message. However, the religionists do not like to have their pastures spoiled; so they wrongfully accuse the publishers of being peddlers and colporteurs and try to wrongfully apply laws governing colportage to them. There have been numerous cases where the publishers have been taken to the office of the police and questioned. Usually they have been released to continue their activities. Reports of four actual arrests have come to this office during the year. We have written letters to the authorities of the towns where the arrests took place, explaining our work, and showing that the liberty to carry on this work Is guaranteed by the Belgian constitution. We have heard no more of two of the arrests. The third was settled by having the two brethren who were in prison released, and the fourth is still pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy, however, cannot stop the mouths of God’s servants by putting them in prison. Two of these brothers found themselves In a large room with about 35 other prisoners, so they immediately went to work. They found many hearing ears, and one man has openly declared himself for The Theocracy. All together, we know of 7 men In that prison who are now studying the truth. Thus we see that the Devil thwarts his own purpose by having God’s ministers thrown into prison, as this just enables them to preach the gospel to these persons whom they would otherwise be unable to contact. This gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached, and there Is no human or demoniacal power that can stop it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Public meetings are another feature of the service that has greatly expanded in Belgium during the year. Due to the Theocratic Ministry School the number of public speakers is steadily increasing. Most of the companies have followed the instructions concerning the public meeting activity as outlined in the March, 1947, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> with gratifying results. This summer some companies have organized some outdoor public meetings with success. The following experience was sent in by a company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We were working a rural territory, a village of 2,000 inhabitants. Most of the factories were closed, due to the vacation period, and consequently many persons were away from home. However, we counted 131 persons around our platform, of whom 40 were brethren. Our loud-speakers could be heard for a distance of about 550 yards. If we counted the persons in automobiles and the passers-by who stopped to listen and the persons who were at their windows, it would not be an exaggeration to count 175 listeners of whom 135 would be strangers. It is needless to say that we immediately began to prepare for more openair meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During March of this year we received a shipment of used clothing from the American brethren for the full-time publishers. All the pioneers and the members of the Bethel family were helped, and there was some left for needy company publishers. This help was much appreciated by the Belgian brethren and they have asked to have their expression of appreciation transmitted to the American brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we glance back over the year just passed it fills us with joy, because we see how Jehovah has richly blessed us. We take courage because we know that God Is with us. When we consider all the obstacles that the Devil has placed in the way to stop the onward march of the truth, we really marvel that such a good increase has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some, supposing that “gain is godliness”, have fallen into the snare of Satan, and there have been those who have complained and found fault. But there are so many others that are anxious to serve the Lord, and who appreciate this glorious privilege of service, that those who do not progress have gone unobserved. On the other hand, how true are Paul’s words that “godliness with contentment is great gain”. Yes, to serve faithfully in the place where God has placed us in his organization brings great contentment. If we have God’s approval, that is all that matters. Those who are not satisfied to remain faithfully at their posts of duty, waiting upon the Lord to direct them, but who try to find contentment by other means, soon pierce themselves through with many sorrows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So we begin our new service year more determined than ever to stick to our work where Jehovah places us in his organization, knowing that such a course is a source of great gain. For this reason we face our work for the coming year with joy, fully convinced that our heavenly Father will lead us in the ‘way of pleasantness and prosperity’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Belgium office looks after the work in Luxembourg, and, while there are no more publishers in the field this year than last year, the brethren have made advances in the preaching of the gospel. In the capital city there are only eight publishers. The remainder of the 47 brethren are scattered throughout the territory of 300,000 inhabitants. What this little country needs is some full-time publishers, and it is hoped that we can get some Gilead graduates into that country. A brief report from the Belgian Branch servant and the depot servant follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luxembourg is predominantly Catholic, and especially the women and farm people are very much under the Influence of the clergy. There are, however, many persons who see the abominations practiced in Christendom and who welcome Jehovah’s witnesses and the comforting message which they bring. There has not been much open opposition to the preaching of the message, and generally the publishers have enjoyed much more freedom than in years gone by. During two consecutive Sundays last October the local gendarmerie of Mondorf-les-Bains confiscated the literature of 5 and 12 publishers respectively. But when the matter was brought before the justice of the peace at Remich the brethren were acquitted and their property was restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the brethren in Luxembourg appreciate very much the privilege of singing praises to Jehovah among the nations is shown by the following report from the depot servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“During the year we have had many blessings from Jehovah due to the fact that we have been able to proclaim his name and Kingdom publicly and with a freedom that even surprises us. How could we have been able to organize public meetings before the war? How could we have been able to carry large placards in the streets of the cities of this country impregnated with the papist religion? Today it is altogether natural, for us as well as for the religious populace. It is only by the power of his holy spirit that we have been able to advance the Kingdom Interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Now the Esch company has rented a large Kingdom Hall which will enable it to give new life to all its activities, since such a meeting-place will attract the newly interested to the regular company meetings. One can even hold public meetings In this hall. For this reason we immediately undertook a new series of public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The circuit assembly at Esch during January, 1948, was for all of us a comfort and an occasion of great joy. But the district assembly which was held at Schifflange, July 16-18, 1948, was truly the culminating point of the year. For the 60 publishers present this assembly was the basis upon which will be built up our activity in the field of the Lord for the coming year.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The publishers in the South American republic of Bolivia have good cause for rejoicing. There are now 36 regular singers of praise to Jehovah in that nation. These have seen their ranks more than doubled during the year, and this gives them real cause for rejoicing. Companies have been organized in Oruro, Cochabamba and La Paz. The public meetings conducted in these cities have aroused much interest. Some progress is now being made among the native Indians. A few are taking up the truth and carrying it in to the native settlements. The Branch servant in the La Paz office sends in an interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another missionary home was established in Oruro, the third now in Bolivia. The four missionaries in this home, who are the last ones to arrive in Bolivia, have had to get accustomed to the high altitude of Oruro, the language, and the customs of the people. The altitude, 12,000-13,000 feet, was quite severe for one of their group especially, but they have all quickly become acclimated and have done very well in the service. Their placements and time in the service have been excellent, and in August they have reported 22 studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On our former service visits to Oruro we always noticed the friendliness of the people. Now one of the special pioneers writes the following about their experiences in Oruro:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The people here have received us very kindly, and the only opposition so far comes from the Indian Bolivian missionaries from Canada. We have studies with many Catholics. One school professor whom I found in the door-to-door work said that though he is Catholic he does not care for them, for they do not study the Bible. I arranged for a study the next night, as he took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Kingdom Is at Hand’</span><span class="font6"> in Spanish and a Spanish Modern Version Bible. Brother Patrick and I were there until eleven that night and have been for every other study with him and his wife, answering questions. He volunteered the other night, ‘In my house I have a beautiful statue of Christ, but some man made that with his hands, and for some time I have wondered why people should kneel down and pray to such man-made things.’ From there he went on to expose the drunken adulterous priests, both spiritually with politics and in the flesh! You should see him and his wife drink in the truths exposing the God-dishonoring doctrines of trinity and purgatory I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cochabamba, Bolivia’s second-largest city, a company was also organized in January of this year. The people have not been so receptive of the truth in Cochobamba as they seem to be in Oruro. Catholicism has a stronger hold and more opposition has been manifested. Our Bolivian brethren there, however, have taken a firm stand for the Kingdom and have joined with our American brethren in giving the testimony. In the last couple of months the brother who Is company servant in Cochabamba, besides going regularly In the field service, has also been displaying the literature in the open-air market where he sells things, with the result that he has placed quite a number of books and booklets. The special pioneers of the Cochabamba missionary home will soon have worked the entire city and immediate rurals for the fourth time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In La Paz the poor and common people, including the Indians and most of the mestizos, are about the hardest class to approach with the truth because of their lack of interest or their indifference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nevertheless among these there also are “sheep”. Over a year ago a young Indian man who can read and write attended a book study conducted with a tailor in La Paz, and later he moved out in the country with his parents. When seen again, a study was arranged with all the family at his little adobe house out in the country. The study is held in a small room with a dirt floor. The women will sit either right on the floor or right in the center of the bed, but seldom on the edge of the bed. At first it was hard to keep the young man’s wife, father and mother, who speak Aymard and hardly any Spanish, awake at the study even though the young man interpreted in Aymard what was discussed in the Spanish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;.</span><span class="font6"> But now no more sleeping for them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another Indian, who reads and writes, after attending some studies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font6"> took various books to study and distribute. He went out by truck to other towns on the alti-plano and placed the literature among the Indians. When the books were distributed, he came back for half a carton of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we look back over the period of three short years since the first Gilead graduates arrived in Bolivia and consider all the wonderful provisions that Jehovah has made whereby we might give Kingdom testimony in a strange land to a people who had not heard, our hearts are filled with thanksgiving for all these privileges enjoyed. By being able to sing Jehovah’s praises among the nations we have thereby called to the attention of honest hearts the matter of greatest Importance, The Theocracy, and have witnessed a response to our invitation to first come and then say come to others. We extend our love and greetings to all our brethren world-wide.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Portuguese discovered this land of Brazil in their new world of great riches in April, 1500, just after pope Alexander VI divided the world by a line running north and south, giving half to Spain and half to Portugal. Brazil is rich in the way of natural resources, but the Brazilian is not contented with his country’s gifts from the Creator; and, further, the people of other lands do not want to see the Brazilians reap the gains of their natural resources. The people must look to something else for salvation and pleasure in living, and many are now finding that their only hope lies in the new world of righteousness—a message being vigorously preached by a small group of Jehovah’s witnesses in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A wonderful work has been done in getting in touch with the people of good-will and in turning the minds of the people to the Bible. A 66-percent increase is seen in the number of publishers engaging in the field service this year as compared with last. The brethren have enjoyed the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign, the testimony periods, the circuit and district assemblies, all with the same keen appreciation manifested by their brethren in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother N. A. Yuille, who had faithfully served as Branch servant for over 12 years, finished his earthly course just before the Memorial season. We rejoice with him in his privileges of service in the spacious heavenly realm of the Kingdom. A new servant was appointed to look after the activities in Brazil, and Brother Leathco, a graduate of Gilead, sends in a very interesting and colorful report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a people whose cry is most pitiful. To the north he begs freedom from the exploiting capitalist of North America, and to the east mercy from the slavery of the Jesuits. The Roman religion has bound him in wedlock to poverty. The American pumps his oil, the Englishman polishes off his gems, and the Portuguese pirates away with his commercial gold, but the church burns his soul when he throughly comes clean with all that’s left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year’s campaign to disciple this nation got off in haste with a leap of one hundred publishers in September over the last month in the old service year. The increase pressed on through the latter part of 1947, until In December over one thousand publishers had risen in the field ripe for the harvest. This notable climb can best be attributed to organization. The servants to the brethren were well established in the field. It certainly shows that Jehovah’s holy spirit works through an orderly organization, one well organized for his service. The two servants to the brethren by December had completed their first time around to visit the then 47 companies and also a number of isolated publishers. To date the company organizations have increased to 57. In November the field publishers for the first time got the new </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font6"> printed in Portuguese. These are contributing factors in the rapid increase despite the fact that no conventions or district assemblies were held in 1947. Two circuit assemblies were held In the latter half of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By August almost all the companies in the two circuits had been covered well two times. All interested and isolated were visited in the interior of the country. Along the slow-flowing almost continent-long Amazon river the servant to the brethren traveled by boat for two weeks, entering at last into the once fabulously rubber-rich city of Manaus. There close around in the thick jungle are located four companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. There our brethren’s habits and costumes are different. They matcli their habitat. One does not sleep on a mattress and springs, but outside on a swinging hammock stretched from limb to tree. One does not walk up the sidewalk or a dusty path to the Kingdom Hall, but on the ocean-like Amazon, w’hich overflows its banks to a great extent, there are villages afloat on barge foundations which rise and fall with the river. One paddles to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study, for the hall floats also. There in the big game country the Lord’s people practice how to flsh and hunt out the “other sheep” concealed In one of the rockiest and out-of-the-way places In the world. The visit of the servant to the brethren was for them their first direct contact with others of the Lord’s organization. Most of them have never contacted any of their brethren outside their jungle home before. More than a month was spent with them giving help and explanations in how to apply </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font6"> to their local companies. A circuit assembly was held with the 165 brethren in their first assembly as the Lord’s servants. All were filled with joy and greatly strengthened. The servant to the brethren held, In both northern and southern Brazil together, 9 circuit assemblies, by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has and operates four missionary homes in Brazil. One home with two missionary brothers is located in northern Brazil in the city of Salvador, the country’s first capital of the 15th century until 1762. In Rio de Janeiro, which in 1762 became the country’s capital and still is, are located two other homes with a total of eleven missionaries. To the south in the mountain city of Silo Paulo, where the air is fresh and light in high elevation, is located the fourth home with Its ten members. This city is the industrial center of Brazil and where the majority of Jehovah’s witnesses reside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite being such a large country with such a puny population within its boundaries, Brazil has put up stiff immigration regulations which make it open to only the rich and professional class of workers. Permanency within the country will not be granted without giving first a guarantee of employment In the high wage bracket by the immigrant; but, by the Lord’s grace, none of our missionaries have been forced to leave, despite repeated threats. Their work has caused the companies with which they are associated to grow in number of publishers, especially of late in Rio, where two of the homes are located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August were held two district assemblies: our first, from August 6-8, in Rio de Janeiro, serving the north of Brazil. In SSo Paulo, August 20-22, was held the second one, serving all the south of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The father of a family of new publishers, who started in the service for the first time at one of the assemblies, relates that upon presenting his wife a new </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book she scolded him for spending money for a book; but upon learning what it cost she read it and then scolded him for not having brought it before then. As a result, when a back-call was made on them they came to the Kingdom Hall. Seeing the company chart and its service report they wanted to know how they could have a part in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now at the assembly they went into the service and were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another publisher reported how she had come into contact with a number of her book studies. She relates that she is a schoolteacher, who upon learning the truth went to work debunking the bunk that the Catholic priest instilled daily in her school pupils during the afternoon religious hour. Her efforts were so successful that the parents questioned their children of whom they had been taught these pleasant truths. As a result of the witness given through the children she was brought in contact with many of the parents and started studies with some of them. Now at the assembly she brought three families with her. She tells how one day the priest became angry because the children paid little or no attention to his weary words. He decided on a purge. He called on any who were not good Catholics to at once leave the room. Out walked the whole class with their backs to him. Turning to her with clasped hands to his head he cried aloud In despair and anxiety, “Are these kids all crazy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We give thanks to Jehovah for his mercy and kindness in extending to Brazil the privilege of participating in singing praises unto Jehovah among the persons of good-will in this nation. Also for providing us with the visible organization through which we may be directed. As a result of his guidance through his holy spirit we were up to 1,319 strong in publishing his praises in this the last month of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We send our ardent affection and salutations to you and to our brethren all over the earth who are serving as “God’s ministers”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Here again it is true that the people have no real hope. The same problems face them as face the rest of the world: the rising cost of living, a series of local strikes, and the pessimistic news from the outer world, including the sad state of affairs of their former homelands of India and Africa. Jehovah’s witnesses in British Guiana have a wonderful opportunity for bringing comfort to these people, and they are doing it, by the Lord’s grace. These ministers know that there are “other sheep” who are not of the heavenly fold, and these the Lord is also bringing unto his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this South American colony, British Guiana, a good witness has been given during the year. A 30-percent increase has been seen in the average number of publishers serving the Kingdom, and the brethren have had good experiences in the field. The Branch servant sets out a number of these living testimonies to one’s ministry in his annual report. Some of these are related here for your enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One publisher related how an Anglican woman came out of a yard in Georgetown and accepted an invitation to a public lecture. She listened to the Kingdom message. Failing to obtain her address, the sister watched for her In the street work and finally made another contact. Upon calling at her home, the “Trinity” doctrine was discussed from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> the book was placed, and a study arranged. “Within one month she told me that she had prayed for the truth and although Anglican and formerly opposed to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses she now saw that this was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font6"> and she was determined that nothing could take it from her.” This is one of nearly 300 book studies being conducted weekly in the colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From a home Bible class, the next logical step is to become a Kingdom publisher. Another witness gives this account : “After studying for a few months with an East Indian woman and two ot her sons, I invited the boys, aged 12 and 14, to go out in the service. One morning after finishing the houses assigned to them, they went with me to the next house. After presenting the offer, I said to the younger one, ‘Burnet, will you please explain to the woman about the booklets you have?’ After his effective explanation, the lady said, ‘My, you are a good little minister!’ She then tested him with such questions as, ‘Where do you find the Ten Commandments?’ and he promptly answered each one. This caused her to remark that she had never seen pupils in Sunday school reply so readily. The two boys are attending </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies and give good answers there too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an isolated settlement 115 miles up the Berbice river, a man was reading publications that he had obtained downriver. Soon he wrote to the Branch office, requesting someone to be sent there to organize a company. A steamer trip was made by the Branch servant, and, after a few days of witnessing in a small canoe with him, the company was formed. What a joy it was to see how closely to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font6"> this individual had kept, by carefully reading and applying Theocratic rules to himself!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since then he brought three other persons with him to the recent assembly where he was baptized and also enrolled as a pioneer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the hottest part of the year came the district assembly, August 27-29. An early arrival was a shy young woman, from a country village where pioneers have worked for a year. She had expressed to one pioneer that although she believed that this was the truth, she just couldn’t be a witness. But what did the convention do for her? She put on an apron to assist in the cafeteria, took it off to go out in the street work, information-walking, and house-to-house activity, thoroughly enjoyed every session and without any reluctance turned In her first field service report. By Jehovah’s grace mental mountains can be moved!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming together from 16 different points in the colony, a total of 173 publishers carried on the greatest Kingdom advertising campaign that Georgetown has ever seen! If some persons had not read the several newspaper announcements of the assembly, or had even failed to notice the 120 small store-window signs, they could hardly miss the human advertisers, riding cycles adorned with placards or walking in long lines through the streets. The result of the intensive advertising was our largest Town Hall audience to date: over 700 persons. The assembly activity aided in our attaining a new peak of publishers in British Guiana, 220.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the Georgetown company held 40 public meetings, with six months in the open air. Fifteen of these talks were given in the Kingdom Hall with an average attendance of 100, whereas 23 were held under the stars with audiences averaging 335 persons. This increased activity has been greatly facilitated by using the sound equipment provided by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who knows but some of these very listeners may soon be joining the ranks of Kingdom publishers, extending the call of the Good Shepherd to countless other prospective sheep. Then, as the next service year closes, they too will have some good field experiences to relate to their brethren in other parts of the earth, who joyfully thumb through the pages of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> and therein find abundant evidence that ‘of the increase of his Government and peace there shall be no end’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The old question as to ‘who shall rule’ came to the fore in British Honduras again during this year. This country has been a colony of Britain for many years. The long-festering sore finally came to a head when Guatemala strongly contended that that land was rightly its possession. The British, of course, show no inclination to giving it up. The rumor got around that Guatemala was going to invade and take over, and within a very short time British troops were on Honduran soil to protect its boundaries and border crossings were closed. This has had a great effect on the economic situation in British Honduras during the year. The situation has kept the people in a state of unrest; they are not sure of employment and are constantly worried; so it has been hard to bring the minds of the people around to give serious thought to the truth. But even with these conditions of internal distress, the few publishers of the Kingdom have continued to advance, spreading the message in various parts of the land. While there is no increase in number of publishers in British Honduras, there is no loss either. The Branch servant there gives us some interesting experiences which show that good effort is being put forth to preach the gospel. Among other things he writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people are held in fear of religion, especially in these difficult times. If they belong to the Catholic organization, they feel as though that organization will be of some influence in helping them get jobs. While earth’s conditions get much worse, they hope that organization will aid them in food and clothing. A number of persons have turned to the lottery in hope of winning the necessary cash in order to buy clothes and food. The people are afraid to make a move. When they hear the Kingdom message, they see the distinction between the truth of the Bible and what is taught by the various religions, but still they are hesitant. But despite all this the preaching goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of Jehovah’s missionaries in Belize was returning from a visit with a group of Jehovah’s witnesses to the south; and while sitting in the dining room on the boat, he got in conversation with the owner of the vessel. The conversation naturally turned to our work. The doctrine of the “trinity” came up; scriptures were presented, and finally the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let OotL Be True”</span><span class="font6"> was produced because the owner wanted to read the chapter on the “trinity”. He left the group to read, while the discussion continued with others. Finally the owner returned after having read the chapter, and he wanted to know how he could obtain the book. Then a young man interrupted and said he would like to get a copy too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several months later on another trip on this same boat the publisher met this young man again. He expressed his great appreciation for having read the book and immediately subscribed for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and obtained additional publications. He told the missionary how busy he was telling others what he had read in the book, and he showed great surprise and concern at the fact that out of the many people he spoke to very, very few were interested in a discussion on the Bible. However, this does not surprise Jehovah’s witnesses, who know that the Devil has tried to blind the minds of all people lest they gain a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two assemblies were held in British Honduras during the year. At the second one Brother Steelman, a special representative of the Society, served at Belize and assisted the brethren there in becoming better organized. There is still much work to be done in this country, and a lot of help has to be given the company publishers, but we are looking ahead to the coming year of service confident that we shall see a real forward advance in the true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain have experienced the joys of expansion this year. In their desire to praise Jehovah “yet more and more”, they have received the blessing of the Lord which makes one truly rich. With the intensifying of the witness work a real sense of unity and prosperity has come to the brethren in the British Isles. There have been many obstacles to overcome, but only such as are common to all of God’s people as they faithfully shoulder their Kingdom responsibilities. The havoc wrought by the recent war is still very visible to the eyes of the British citizens, and along with this they have their doubts and uncertainties for the future. Hearing and following the Kingdom message is the only hope for these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was just a little over ten years ago that some of the brethren in Britain thought they did not have enough pioneer territory for the few pioneers who were then enrolled. Since the change of work, following through on interest and making back-calls and having book studies, what a change has taken place in their minds concerning territory! Never has there been a greater need for help in Britain to serve the people. In that land alone there are four cities of over a million population, and Greater London has over ten million people. The British held needs more pioneers and more publishers, and it is a joy to say they are going in the right direction to get them. Wonderful advances have been made. The report by the Branch servant shows the joy of Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain and what they are accomplishing by the Lord’s grace. Some excerpts are printed here from that report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The singing of Jehovah’s praises has been our theme throughout the year, and it can be truly said that the past year has not been matched in volume of work by any previous year in the history of God’s people in this land. With the weekly circuit assemblies always running in some part of the field; the large number of public meetings ; the appearance of the publishers in the streets and at the doors, constantly before the people, ‘holding forth the Word of Life,’ it can be said that the message has been raised high before the people. There has been an increase of 20 percent in the average monthly number of publishers, with several new peaks during the year, culminating with an all-time peak of 15,555 in August, the closing month of the year. The back-calls and book studies have grown correspondingly. But in the public meeting work we have had tremendous increase. The number of meetings held jumped from 9,756 during the previous year to 13,247 for 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The territory in this country is compact, and this enables the publishers to find a ready audience for the public talks in all kinds of places. In fact, the outdoor meetings have multiplied during the summer months. The use of bombed sites in the cities, and on the seashore around the coasts In the small towns, public talks have been given to good effect. It appears that much of our activity In the way of public meetings will be of this nature, especially as difficulties arise in the booking of halls. In many of the cities sites have been established at street corners and there the series have been given week by week. As it was when Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was on earth, so today, the message goes out under the free heavens with no ‘butting In’ by the clergy In the canceling of halls. The co-operation of the publishers in giving their support to these efforts has been good to see. We attribute to these talks much of the growth of the new interest during the year and we intend to intensify these activities so that ‘this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached’. As always, the clergy are getting more embittered and a wail goes up all over the land. After deriding Jehovah’s witnesses with much venom, one says in the public press: “What may we learn from these people? Simply this: .to emulate them in their zeal and visiting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of our greatest joys during the year has been that of witnessing so many take the forward step into the pioneer service. More than 500 new pioneers have enrolled following upon the receipt of the letters exhorting all to consider well their position in the light of the present-day urgency of the work. We have nearly 1,300 in the pioneer ranks, now that the vacation pioneers have returned to school. There were over 100 of our young publishers enrolled, and this is the highest on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very favorable pioneer requirements make it possible for many more to enlarge their privileges of service, and we confidently look to the time when we shall have reached our full 10 percent of the publishers. The joy experienced by the new pioneers is well expressed by the following letter: “I have just completed my second month of pioneer service and can say that the daily contacts with the people of all kinds and persuasions has been a time of joy and satisfaction that years of nibbling publisher activity could never produce.” Such letters can be multiplied and there is so much that can be done by those unfettered by secular ties. Now that the work of expansion is on, our need for pioneers increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been our happy lot to partake of the unselfish love of our brethren in a very practical way by the receipt of a large shipment of clothing and food packages from America. The pioneers have been supplied with these and it has been a joy to have some share in passing the good things on. There are many, many expressions of deep gratitude. The need has been there and we wish on behalf of the brethren in this country to say how much these tokens of your love for the Lord and his people have meant to them. Not only the gifts themselves, but the evidence of the Lord’s care in and through his people. Our brethren in Australia and New Zealand have likewise given assistance. We are glad to be able to say that the situation is now getting a little easier. These necessary things have done much to help the pioneers stay in the full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we enter upon the new service year we have bright hopes of much increase in 1949. We will, by the Lord’s grace, continue to sing his praises and seek first the Kingdom while we feed on the rich food that he supplies for our sustenance. “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness” is certainly true of Jehovah’s dealings with us at the close of 1948.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Branch office at London directs the work in Eire and Malta, and interesting reports have been received from both of these countries. Eire has been beset by religious quarrels for centuries; whereas Malta is solidly dominated by the Catholic influence. In Eire there are the two elements, the Catholic and Protestant religions. Religion has kept the people apart and has always been a barrier to unity and peace within the nations. The message has gone into Eire, and year by year gains have been made in the way of preaching. A large number of books and booklets have been placed and many more calls on interested persons have been made compared with last year, when 8,237 back-calls were made. This year 11,736 back-calls were reported, and book studies have also increased. By the Lord’s grace, the gospel of the Kingdom will continue to be proclaimed so that the “other sheep” in Eire will find the place of refuge in the Kingdom under Christ, the King. An interesting report by the London Branch servant tells us of some of these advances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much good work has been done in Eire of recent years and there has been quite a stir due to the persistent efforts put forth by the publishers of the Kingdom. There can be no question that many hungry souls are looking for the truth and finding comfort. The hard conditions which religion has imposed upon them have caused many to sigh and cry. The time has surely come when the Lord will hear their cry and give them hope. It requires something more than determination to continue proclaiming the message in Eire. It is the spirit of the Lord directing and supporting his servants that enables them to keep up the witness to the Kingdom. The activities of Jehovah’s servants have brought them into the courts, and a testimony has been given which, we believe, will bear fruit in the days ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The past year has seen true progress in all features of the Kingdom service. There has been an average monthly increase of 40 percent in number of Kingdom publishers. With a peak of 62 publishers, the work reached its high point in August, the final month of the service year. Most of the publishers are located in Dublin. These engage regularly in all features of activity. The spectacle of the publisher standing in the streets displaying the magazines at first caused a mild sensation in Catholic Dublin, but now they have gotten used to it and many interesting discussions take place between the Dublin people and the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in Cork the witness work has been carried on under more difficult conditions. Opposition has been met with all along the line, and this culminated in a court case on July 19. This came about as a result of an assault upon two of the pioneer brothers. Time and again they were confronted with the accusation that they were communists. An open attack was made by the mob which undoubtedly had been incited by certain public statements of the priests, such as the following excerpt taken from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Independent,</span><span class="font6"> March 18, 1948. “Pernicious Books and Pamphlets: On the instruction of the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Most Rev. Dr. Cohalan, the priests at all the Masses in Waterford City churches condemned the action of certain people who had been selling what purported to be Catholic books and pamphlets, but which contained matter contrary to Catholic teaching . . . He would say ‘Well done’ to the people who had closed their doors in the faces of the vendors of this literature, but he understood that those people who represented themselves as ‘Christian workers’ were very difficult to get rid of, and that they were inclined to enter houses and argue on religious questions. In such cases the bishop recommended that Catholics who were unable to put them out of their houses, as some people had experienced difficulty in doing, should call in the authorities, who would see that they were removed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was decided that the persons who made the assault should be brought to book. After much delay in the hearing of the case, and requests that we might accept an apology instead, the issue of the Kingdom was brought into the court. Under the Lord’s direction without a doubt, we were able to get Catholics who had witnessed the assault to testify in favor of the brothers. The brothers were severely knocked about and two of the witnesses gave true and effective witness to the truth at the risk of becoming very unpopular in their own district. One result is evident, due to the good stand made by the publishers, the question of their being communists was refuted for all to see. Most of the Eire newspapers carried a fairly full report of the case. Five of the defendants were fined and lasting benefit has been witnessed in all parts of Eire. Many have expressed their approval of the decision as the pioneers have moved among the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This small island in the Mediterranean sea has for centuries been a Roman Catholic stronghold. The people are very religious, never questioning the priests’ words. For many years the people have been undisturbed in their religious beliefs and practices; so now when the Kingdom message is presented to them it surprises them and causes doubts in their minds as to their former beliefs. Of course, if they accept the Bible, they will have to reject the teachings of the Catholic church. What the future holds for these people in learning more of the truth depends on God’s direction and blessing on the witness in that land. From the year’s report furnished by the British Branch servant, the following is stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the moment there is only one regular Kingdom publisher on the island, and he, because of circumstances, is temporarily restricted in his field service activity. However, he continues to keep in touch with the good-will interest, seeking to increase their appreciation of the truth of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the course of the year, the two special pioneers had to leave after being charged with the “public vilification of the Roman Catholic religion”. This case, which was taken right through the Appeal Court, attracted much attention, and a very powerful witness was given about the Kingdom and its ministry to the honor of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is by no means easy to carry on the witness work in Malta. There are many barriers which have to be overcome by the Kingdom publishers. The Society’s literature is proscribed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although witnessing has been limited due to the peculiar conditions on the island, yet, by God’s grace, good work has been accomplished during the year. “Seed” has been sown. It Is with confidence and thanksgiving that we look to Jehovah to give the increase in his due time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The praising of Jehovah will never cease, and it is a joy now for Jehovah’s witnesses in the British West Indies to sing these praises at the world’s end. By doing this they are assured permanent dwellings. During the year excellent progress has been made in this vast territory of many islands that come under the direction of the Branch. It is observed from the report that a 40-percent increase in number of publishers was made over last year. The Branch servant points out in his report that the great work the brethren tried to do was to consolidate the advances made the previous year, helping the publishers to become more consistent in their service. This did result in an encouraging increase in the average number of publishers serving under the Branch. As all the publishers come to see the seriousness and the urgency of the work in which they are engaged and as they look after their work regularly, even greater work can be accomplished among the people of good-will. Regularity in service is certainly reflected in the reports of the company organizations. It helps the publishers to more clearly appreciate the need of back-calls and the book-study work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstanding in the report is the increase in number of back-calls for the British West Indies. They increased from 58,666 in 1947 to 70,941 in the 1948 service year, while book studies increased 200 a month, also. The good information provided the publishers at the circuit and district assemblies was also appreciated, and the fine educational work carried on among the brethren is certainly reflected in the reports for the year. Other items that lent to the progress of the gospel-preaching in the British West Indies are set out in some of the excerpts from the report for the year by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One thing that was emphasized at all the assemblies was the necessity of pressing the public meeting campaign and the ease of arranging a series in the open air. Companies that had held them reported outstanding success in the way the public attended. Little time had to be spent in trying to find </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> hall in a suitable location for covering that part of the company’s territory. Just find a favorable shopkeeper on the roadside in a settlement, and everything was arranged. If electric lights were not available, then a gasoline lantern furnished by the brethren met the need nicely. Public squares in the towns made ideal sites and could usually be gotten by applying to the officials. To expand their meetings the Port of Spain company bought a fine modern publicaddress system, which has greatly aided the meetings, especially the open-air. All who attended could easily hear the speaker even when traffic or other disturbances would have interfered without an address system. Nearly all lectures put on for the year open-air were invariably better attended than those in halls. Soon after the district assembly in Port of Spain a series was arranged in the same square where the public lecture for the assembly had been given. A peak attendance of 785 attended one talk of the series. Nearly all the companies put on some lectures, which caused the fine increase over last year as shown on the field service report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the circuit assembly which was held during the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscription campaign It was recommended that all the companies be sure to take the offer to the business districts in their assignments. Accordingly, in Port of Spain the Gilead brethren called on the business section in April. Jn about three weeks of that month they were able to obtain 229 subscriptions, which helped to make April the record month of all time for subscriptions, over 500, and contributed largely to the final number obtained for the campaign. Quite a number of subscriptions were gotten by calling on the names of expired subscriptions. As these names were received from the United States Branch they were mailed on to the companies and contacted. Frequently the party contacted immediately resubscribed and gave the Impression of just waiting to be called on for his subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year there was just one missionary home, in the Branch at Port of Spain. This home has now been in operation for almost two years and has had a good effect on the brethren and the work. The first year of the home’s operation there were continual and large Increases in the number of publishers In the company. This year there were more Increases but no large gains. A new home was opened up at San Juan in March to aid the company get better organized and give better service to the people of good-will. Much spade work had to be done by them in getting a proper servant organization started, and things are progressing along that line. At St. John’s, on the island of Antigua, a temporary home of two brothers has been functioning from May with good results to the local brethren and interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of these Gilead graduates in particular &quot;has aroused the ire and alarm of the clergy. They have resorted to their usual tactics of lies and misrepresentation and circulation of tracts in an effort to prejudice the people against the message. This is noticeable in the back-call work, and those who resist such efforts repeat what is said to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the new provisions for pioneers were made and the ten percent of publishers was set, we began to stress the pioneer service at servant to the brethren visits and at assemblies in addition to the letters and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> articles. Would we reach the quota? Well, we did not quite reach it, but are getting close. Fifty-four pioneers reported in January besides the specials. Seventy-four reported for August, which is encouraging. With provision made for part-time work, those who were able to secure such felt free to devote more time to the back-call and book-study work. This has resulted in good to both the pioneer as he gains proficiency and to the ones of good-will. Some have done tutoring on the side, while others take in some sewing or do furniture polishing or cleaning and pressing. All are trying to arrange their affairs to give full attention to their ministry and continue therein faithfully. For the month of August eight made use of their vacations to be vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year for the first time a number of the brethren began to appreciate and make use of their privilege of honoring the Lord with their substance in donating to the “Good Hopes”. Following the article in the May 1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> on “Where the Money Comes from for Kingdom Work”, a decided increase in donations to the “Good Hopes” occurred. Most of the donations were small, but reflected the desire of the brethren to make friends with Jehovah and Christ Jesus with their “mammon of unrighteousness” and make more sure their hope of a permanent dwelling.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Word is received from time to time from this country behind the “iron curtain”. We know of 10 or 15 brethren who are meeting regularly to study the Society’s publications. There is very little they can do in the field service except to talk with the people as they have opportunity, telling them of the truth. They have no literature to place, but the few booklets they have at their disposal they lend to the people. Expression has been made by the brethren there of their gratitude to those who have helped them in a material way with clothing and food which has been sent from time to time from Switzerland and America. Quoting from a recent letter, a brother states, “We feel closely united with you in spirit and are doing all that is in our power toward the vindication of Jehovah’s name.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This small country of 17,000,000 people gained its independence from England. This did not improve conditions as people thought it would, however. Communistic troubles, wrecking of trains, crippling of communications and general unrest are found in the country. The people are more disturbed than ever. But these conditions have not hindered the expansion work as carried on by Jehovah’s servants. His blessing has been upon the small group there. Last year there was an average of 19 publishers. Now we find a 90-percent increase in number of ministers for the 1948 service year, with an average of 36 publishers and a peak of 52. Here people of every tongue are coming to the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Branch servant sets out a very interesting experience of some brethren who learned of the truth 100 miles away from the Branch office at Rangoon. Now they have learned of the Lord’s organization and are happy to be associated with it. This shows us how Jehovah can take care of His “other sheep”. He gathers them; we have the privilege of feeding them. The Branch servant will make a trip to these brethren as soon as he can arrange it. His interesting report follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were glad when two more Gilead graduates arrived in January. Shortly they were out in the field going from house to house, making back-calls and engaging in all other forms of service. This brought the number of Gilead graduates up to four. These Gilead graduates have done much to aid the local publishers and they have started many newly interested persons in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God through his organization is reconstructing the true worship here. All publishers have seen how He works. During the past year he has made it possible for us to move from our bamboo and mat Kingdom Hall several miles out of town to a new location in the center of Rangoon. This has had a good effect on the work. For many years the same ones attended meetings and there was no increase in publishers, but now, with the new Kingdom Hall and the making of back-calls and the conducting of book studies, there are new ones attending and many new publishers. At company meetings one can see many different races, Burmese, Karens, Indians, Chinese, Europeans, Anglo-Burmans and Gurkhas. All these, forgetting previous religion and nationality, are now studying together, learning about Jehovah and serving him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We appreciate the manner in which the Society provides the free literature and magazines for us. We regularly use these in all branches of service, including store-to-store work and street-corner work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the largest obstacles is the lack of a knowledge of the Burmese language. Among the publishers there is only one who can give a talk in Burmese and only two are capable of translating. Most of the publishers speak the language, but very few know it well enough to be able to give a good witness. The Gilead graduates are working hard spending many hours studying Burmese and hope in a few years to be capable of giving a witness and conducting studies in the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have had many joyful experiences during the past year. Here are a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several months ago two publishers moved from Rangoon to Upper Burma. After a few months’ witnessing, a study was started with a man of good-will. After a few studies he saw this was the truth, and now is a publisher reporting every month. He is an Indian, previously a Catholic, but now a true Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Gilead graduate conducted a book study with a Chinese for eight months, and after a few months as a company publisher he became a pioneer, and now he is conducting eight book studies himself as well as answering questions at all company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a round-about manner a letter was received by the Branch from a group of about twelve persons in Henzada, a town about a hundred miles from Rangoon. This letter stated that they had been studying the Society’s publications for eight years but had never been in contact with the Branch office or any of Jehovah’s witnesses. These brethren are now in contact with the Branch office and are rejoicing at this. Here are a few extracts from letters received from them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Dear Brethren,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is needless to say that I and a few Christians who are interested are overjoyed in the knowledge that Jehovah God, the Father </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> Mercy and God of All Comfort, has at last answered our daily prayer of almost eight years’ duration. I therefore personally, and on behalf of the few Jonadabs here, offer our heartfelt thanks to the heavenly Father through his beloved Son, and secondly to your Society, for the supply of the needed ‘meat in due season’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I beg to inform you, brethren, that for the last few years and up to now my nephew whose eyes were first opened and came to the knowledge of the truth that there is Jehovah God (not the “trinity” god) has started a private Bible-study class in his sister’s house once a week for about two years every Sunday morning, at which his own four sisters, two brothers-in-law, myself and my son and my younger brother attend. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theocratically,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sd/- Po </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lay”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later on he wrote: “With what little I understand by the grace of God I am thoroughly convinced that all religion is a snare and racket, and from that moment I have made an inward consecration to worship and serve Jehovah. We now have a group of a dozen Christians here who have entirely abandoned the Catholic religion. For doing so, the Catholic community here looks down on us, but we don’t mind. We must be God’s pleasers and not man’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With a limited knowledge of my English and lack of your literature in Burmese here, I admit that I am a babe in the knowledge of the things of God’s present truth. I want to study God’s Word more and more in order to equip myself to become a company organization. Therefore please remember me and my little group of Christians here (the Lord’s “other sheep”) in your prayers. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“My nephew and I had some two years ago a sort of discussion or debate with a priest on the subject of certain Catholic doctrines before a few persons for three or four successive days. The subjects covered among other things were (1) Immortality of the Soul, (2) Trinity, (3) Supremacy of the Pope. My nephew told him that he would discuss with him the next day on the subject of Catholic Purgatory and Hell when the priest asked him if he believed in traditions. The priest was told that traditions make the Word of God void. From that day forth he failed to turn up for further discussions. We always explain the Bible truth as far as Jehovah has enlightened us to any Catholic who puts a question to us on any point in his belief. . . . ” “I am 62 years old and have come to the stage in my life where ‘the heart is willing but the flesh is weak’, but with Jehovah everything is possible and I am really very eager to serve Jehovah, who in his infinite mercy has lengthened my life up to the present and has taken me out of darkness to light. Had I died before 1941 I would have died in ignorance of the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even though we are around the other side of the globe we feel close to you brethren at headquarters, and we in Burma send our love to you, dear Brother Knorr, and all you brethren at the home office. We are determined to push the Kingdom work to the utmost and are looking forward to a year of joyful service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Canadian ministers of the Kingdom have been very busy during the service year of 1948. Great was their joy and many were their blessed experiences. It certainly was a joy to them to have 19,513 persons in attendance at the Memorial season. It brings rejoicing to their hearts to know that there are 40 more companies in the country than there were a year ago. Happy are they because 921 persons have signified their consecration to God by water immersion. More hours have been spent preaching the gospel, and 80,000 more back-calls were made than in the previous year. More book studies were conducted every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bethel family has been very busy in the office and printery. More than 15,000,000 advertising items and forms were printed in the small shop. Three hundred and twenty-two thousand copies of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font7"> went through their presses, which was a big aid to the Brooklyn printing plant. Yes, it has been a busy year for the Canadian Kingdom publishers, and you can get that feeling when you read the report of the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We give thanks unto Jehovah and to his King-Son for the clear direction through his organization, making it possible for us to share in the expansion program so powerfully set forth at the Los Angeles convention. Having shared in the persecution and perilous days of World War II, and in the marvelous deliverance by Jehovah’s Right Hand, we have been moved like the prophet-psalmist of old to explain, “My heart is steadfast ... I will sing praises unto thee among the nations I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unprecedented activity, even for Jehovah’s people, has been the order of the day ever since that great gathering at Los Angeles. For this we have been glad, knowing well that gain or increase is not made without hard work and diligent effort. Further energizing force was added by that most enthusiastic and helpful assembly at Philadelphia, where thousands of Canadian brethren were privileged to be in attendance. This provided another springboard for the year’s activities. The wholehearted, stirring response by all present as the ‘Signal to All Nations’ was raised on high gave us all a deeper appreciation of the work that had to be done. What a glorious vision was thereby unfolded to us I And this gave us life and vitality, and called for the very best out of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The assembling together under the direction of the “faithful and wise servant” has certainly fulfilled the Lord’s word, “Lo, how good and lovely it is, when brethren dwell together as one . . . for there has the Lord commanded the blessing.” In prospect for the publishers in Canada were four district assemblies which had been announced at Los Angeles. The cities chosen were Vancouver, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Halifax. The president was to be at all these assemblies and the brethren were determined to make them the best and largest ever held in this country. Three years had passed since the president had visited Canadian cities, and in the meantime several thousand newly interested ones had become associated. So, in addition to the gladsome anticipation by the brethren, many more of the stranger class eagerly looked forward to this happy occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every conceivable form of advertising was adopted. For the four assemblies the handbills totaled 690,000. The lecture delivered was “The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind”, and the total attendance amounted to 17,917, with approximately 7,000 strangers of good-will. The memory of those joyous, peaceful, educative sessions will remain long with us. They have spurred us on to greater activity, more zealous works, increased fervency of spirit, so that nothing will be lacking. The dynamic force released by Jehovah’s spirit at those assemblies has resulted In further equipping the Lord’s people in their work of turning many to righteousness. It has already become evident through our circuit assemblies that the average attendance at meetings has increased. Furthermore, there is indication of increased individual study, and July saw an all-time peak of publishers—over 14,000! We thank Jehovah for his goodness and mercy toward us in making these provisions, and also for the president's untiring, faithful ministry on behalf of his brethren. There is no question of doubt concerning the clear and direct leadings of Jehovah and his Shepherd-King through the “faithful and wise servant”. Day by day we are led into more light of truth through the precious columns of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and can say with the apostle Paul, “Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year the president’s letter of instruction to the Branches provided a service schedule and a policy outline that unmistakably led to a big year—the biggest yet. Therein it was stated, “It is suggested that all countries strive for at least a 10-pcrcent increase in publishers over their average of publishers for 1947. I firmly believe that this can be attained in every nation of the world by following the Lord’s Implicit instruction, ‘Go, disciple all the nations,’ and ‘Preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. . . . ”’ Depending on this direction we moved forward in full faith. This expression of confidence was conveyed to all servants to the brethren and was kept before the minds of the publishers throughout the year. Month by month it has been our delight to witness the effect of this instruction as peak after peak has been attained. Whereas the average number of publishers for the year 1947 was 11,224, this year’s average is 12,003, an Increase of more than 12 percent. Our peak was actually 14,219 as against the previous year’s peak of 12,093.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An added instrument in our hands today is the public meeting campaign. The eight striking titles which were set for the year’s service have been extensively advertised, resulting in nearly 6,500 public meetings being held. In addition to the placards, window cards, and other signs used to advertise, we have printed and dispatched to the companies over 11,000,000 handbills. One of the remarkable features of this campaign Is that it permits all, young and old, male and female, to share in its blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the new service year the good news of a revised pioneer quota was announced, so assisting many to engage full-time in the ministry and yet be a burden to no one. Our total number of full-time servants in the field during August was 851, as against the 1947 figure of 605.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The call went forth to youthful ministers to devote their vacation period to field service. Whereas so many children in the old world just squander their time, some even developing into delinquents, it has been a real pleasure to see ninety children of the New World consecrating an average of 120 hours each per month to singing Jehovah’s praises. Forcefully are we reminded of the days of Jesus when “children . . . shouted in the temple, ‘Hosanna to the Son of David !’ ” Their two months of vacation pioneering provides an excellent foundation upon which to plan a future life career of round-the-year, full-time praising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many pioneers were invited to the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, while others, having finished their training, were assigned to foreign service during the year. Twenty-three left Canada: three assigned to the United States and the others to Trinidad, Haiti, Guadeloupe, Australia, India, Newfoundland, Belgium and Burma. Quebec is our “special” territory 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Considerable legal work has been done, most outstanding of which has been fighting in Quebec the four sedition charges which came to trial. Three of these were heard before French-speaking juries who convicted the brethren, and one before an English-speaking jury that acquitted the brother in 20 minutes. Thirty-five arrests were made for preaching from house to house with the Bible alone, and to date twenty-nine of these cases have been tried and all have been acquitted. In our fight for freedom to worship God two articles were prepared and printed in booklet form: One entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Dynamic American Bill of Rights</span><span class="font6"> containing a brilliant analysis of the practical effects of the Bill of Rights in the United States; the other, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Case for a Canadian Bill of Rights,</span><span class="font6"> being a study of Canadian law on the subject of individual freedoms, demonstrating the need for a written Bill of Rights in this country. Ten thousand copies of each booklet were mailed to lawyers, judges, legislators, editors, leading columnists, and others, together with covering letter. Encouraging letters have been received from some of the recipients, indicating a good work has been accomplished in stirring up the minds of public-spirited men to calmly consider the need for protecting what personal human liberties are now enjoyed by Canadian citizens merely by toleration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From time to time opportunities have been extended to all publishers to join in the fight for freedom, that our brethren may worship Jehovah in Quebec; there has always been a wholehearted and enthusiastic response. At one time it was the distribution of a special article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> dealing with Magna Carta. Another occasion was when arrangements were made for capable brethren to write letters to members of Parliament and thousands were mailed. Yet again, a Petition campaign to commence September 1 was announced by the president at the Ottawa district assembly. There are still more than 1,200 cases pending before the courts which cannot be taken beyond the Recorders courts because there is no provision for appeal. Hence our petition for a Bill of Rights to be written into the Constitution so there will be opportunity to contend before the courts that basic human liberties guaranteed by the Constitution are being violated and by such procedure so get our cases into the Supreme Court of Canada where we believe that the decision would be in our favor because we know we are right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite these obstacles and court cases the work in Quebec is making progress. Early in the year special pioneers were assigned to seven towns in Quebec, with populations ranging from four to twenty thousand, and which towns had never previously received an organized witness. Four of these now have company organizations, while the other three are quickly developing to that point. In Montreal, where there are several units, composed of both French and English brethren, there was a Memorial attendance of practically 1,000. A school is conducted once a week for two hours to instruct pioneer brethren in the French language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An experience concerning 83 brethren who spent a weekend in the Montreal Bordeaux jail is good:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“On Sunday morning we saw each other at breakfast, which comforted us very much. In the afternoon I climbed to my window and was surprised to hear from the outside the voice of my brothers who were in the cell next to mine. In the afternoon we started to sing the Theocratic songs enjoyed by all who were able to hear us. They applauded many times and more than that they were yelling, ‘Sing number 22!’ or ‘Sing number 38!’ After this a prisoner asked, ‘Give us a talk?’ and we told them: ‘If you want to listen we will.’ Then a convention silence set in among the 200 prisoners. This talk on the Kingdom was appreciated by the prisoners according to their applause and yelling. They cried: ‘Again ! Again! Again I’ and then my brother-in-law repeated in part the talk for the English prisoners there. Then they asked questions until 10 o’clock that night. This comforted us very much and rejoiced our hearts to have given a witness to the glorious name of Jehovah, singing even in prison. The guards who heard our talk did not try to stop us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two special pioneers had been finding much interest in a rural community in Quebec and then commenced working in the town. Immediately the priest warned his parishioners not to have anything to do with us, to refuse the literature, and if they did not do so then the curse of God would come on them, stating that such curse might bring calamity on their family, the business or home. The next day his otvn house burned down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the pioneers and company publishers serving in the province of Quebec are having splendid and strengthening experiences. It is a constant joy to see these persons of good-will come out from darkness and superstition and gain true knowledge. During the past year there has been a 24-percent increase in average number of publishers. The publishers are working in full faith and with dependence upon the Lord for their protection and support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This report would not be complete without mentioning the splendid way the brethren in the country have so wholeheartedly supported the many activities, making it possible to extend the true worship of Jehovah in all parts of the land. They truly have made friends with the mammon of unrighteousness and so will gain the Lord’s approval. In addition to supplying the needs for the general work in this land the brethren found it a great joy to have a share in contributing to the relief work, making it possible to send 4,089 standard food packages to many European countries. Just over 46 tons of food were thus made available for faithful fighters in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our great joy is to now feed the multitude with the lifegiving waters of truth, and we know there are thousands in this land who will gladly drink and be satisfied. With eagerness and devoted hearts we will joyfully use all our time and strength to the assistance of these “other sheep” who are ‘sighing and crying’, so they will be strengthened and comforted and make public confession of their faith, thus obtaining salvation. Our year has been full. It has been a blessed one. It is with gratitude to Jehovah that this report is submitted to you, rejoicing greatly in the privileged share we have in serving with you under the Lord’s direction.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The ministers of God in Chile are sharing in the great expansion work, by the Lord’s grace. As one looks at this territory, which reaches away to the north and to the south, he wonders if the great volume of work yet to be done can be accomplished. But then the minister reflects on the patience of God and remembers that salvation was gained through patience. There are only 11 company organizations, and these are scattered throughout the central region of the country. They are served regularly by a servant to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers who have been associated with the companies have for the past three years been studying Theocratic ministry, and many of these brethren are now capable of giving public talks. This work will undoubtedly be increased during 1949. It will take time to reach the people. Jehovah’s witnesses are certainly grateful that God has been patient and has allowed time for this gospel of the Kingdom to be preached. They, too, want to sing the praises of Jehovah “yet more and more”. The Branch servant in his report tells us of the good work being done in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We wonder when and how we shall be able to reach all those that ‘sigh and cry’ with our handful of Kingdom publishers. But as we consider how we have increased threefold during the past three years we can and do appreciate more keenly Jehovah’s promise through his prophet, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Loan of hosts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But to go on with our report: It is to our joy that we can report a 40-percent increase in the average number of publishers during the year and a peak of 231 in August. Hours, back-calls and book studies have likewise increased in proportion ; all of which means that the Kingdom message is going forth with increased intensity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that an average of 18 special pioneers devoted almost half of the total hours spent in the field service during the year; yet they represent less than 10 percent of the average number of publishers. These brethren likewise made and conducted well over half of the total back-calls and average book studies for the year. Their share in the ‘praise song’ to the Most High and the resulting Kingdom expansion is therefore great. Reasonably, their joy is also great because of the resultant blessing of the Lord and the many joyful experiences had daily in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chile is a progressive country. Great strides have been made in the educational field as in others. The result is that many honest-hearted Catholics have seen through the religious racket and now challenge the ban placed on God’s Book, the Bible. They want to know why it is the priests have closed it to the public and now they are getting the answer through the faithful preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Hundreds of Bibles are placed constantly with these honest-hearted prospective “sheep”, along with the many helps explaining it, to the chagrin of the religious leaders. A special pioneer in Santiago writes: “One lady said, ‘When you came to my door and offered me a free Bible study, I thought that I would accept your offer and see why it was a book prohibited to the people.’ In a few studies she was rejoicing and having real happiness in telling the good news to all her friends and helping to start studies with some of them too. Another lady said: ‘Yes, I would like to study the Bible in my home. I am a Protestant but our church makes no provision for home Bible study and I feel greatly the need of it.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a real joy to see how the children likewise are being Instructed in the ways of righteousness. No timidness about them. Out they go along with the older brethren in the door-to-door work. Many young faces are now seen at the meetings, and their intelligent answers show they are gaining knowledge fast. A typical example is a young lad of 11. Six months of Bible study was enough to open his young eyes. A special pioneer conducting the study writes: “One day during the study, the young boy said, ‘Sefiorita, I want to ask you a question. Is the mass in accord with the Bible?’ I explained how it was not, but really nullified the ransom sacrifice by making it a religious mockery. Then he said, Tn church last Sunday, the priest said that a person could be alive tonight and tomorrow in a burning “infierno” or hell. I thought a minute and then said to myself: But the priest is lying because the Bible doesn’t teach a burning hell. Then I looked around at the people kneeling and praying and the priest singing mass and all the candles and statues, and I said: This looks like “tonteria” to me.’ In English that means stupidness. I smiled to myself and continued the study rejoicing to see the spirit of Jehovah acting upon this young mind to release another ‘sheep’ from bondage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the city of Concepcidn comes the experience of a special pioneer who noticed a young man reading an English publication in a park. The pioneer engaged him in conversation and left the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book with him, also invited him to the company studies. He came, and advanced rapidly. Shortly he was participating regularly in the field service and is now making preparations and arrangements to enter the pioneer work. This young man had been impressed originally by our street activity, which is very effective. For example, a publisher was approached by a well-dressed man who asked for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> To the query as to whether he was acquainted with the magazine he answered an abrupt “No”. “But,” he added, “if cultured people present the magazine, it must be cultured too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aiming at the 10-percent goal of all publishers in pioneer service, the full-time ministry was held constantly before the brethren during the year. But it was not until the new 120-hour arrangement went into effect that some were able to overcome seemingly unsurmountable obstacles and joined the pioneer ranks. We more than doubled the average number of general pioneers on the list last year, with an average of 10 now working regularly and 14 reporting in August. These brethren have done a very good portion of the work, as their report shows. Theirs is a real test of endurance to continue, in view of the difficult times, and shows true faith in the Lord’s promise to provide for his own. More are contemplating this blessed service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We confidently look forward to greater Kingdom activity during the coming year. The Lord’s organization is moving forward world-wide and, by his grace and spirit, we hope to keep pace with the forward movement, rejoicing daily in the grand and glorious privilege of singing the praises of Jehovah among the people of good-will in this land. We know our brethren everywhere are doing likewise, and take this opportunity to send our Christian greetings and best wishes to all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Real progress in the advance of true worship has been made in China. The task has not been an easy one for the few who started the work at the beginning of the service year. There were only two active Chinese-speaking publishers, but after diligent work throughout the year there were 11 happy ministers working among the Chinese people in their own tongue. They now have a Chinese company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Shanghai. There are other publishers, too, but they do not speak the Chinese language. Sixteen public lectures were given in Shanghai, where the work is centered at the moment. After we are well organized in that city we can reach out into other territories. It has been difficult to obtain halls, because this is a very overcrowded city, but some persons of good-will have granted us the use of a school. The brethren have advertised the talks well and good success has attended these public assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Branch servant gives us a very interesting report of what has happened in China and also in Tai Wan (Formosa). Here a group of the Lord’s people who were lost for many years, in fact, since 1939, have now been found and are again a part of the organization. The Society is doing everything it can to assist these brethren, and you will enjoy the Branch servant’s story of Kingdom expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A doctor with whom a home Bible study is being conducted is on the committee of the local church, and is also connected with other churches assisting them financially and otherwise. After obtaining </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in the house-to-house work, he began to read, but did not understand, and so put the book away and turned again to his church books. However, when the back-call was made the publisher pointed out the significance of the material in the book and supported it by showing him scriptures from the book. This convinced him that the book should be studied carefully, and a Bible study was arranged and since conducted regularly. He now sees that religion is false and contrary to the Word of God. His own words were, “We sing in the church, ‘Nearer my God to thee,’ yet we are getting farther away all the time. But now that I study these books with the Bible I feel satisfied; this is real spiritual food.” He now attends the meetings regularly and is determined to make a clean break from religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Buddhism is the national religion of China and this thrives on superstition and idol-worship. In many respects Buddism is similar to Catholicism, as it provides for a purgatory, rosary, idols, and such like. A Buddhist has little or no conception of a supreme God, and most of them are difficult to deal with and difficult to convince that Jehovah is the true, living God that all men should worship. But Some Buddhists are turning to Jehovah and getting rid of their Buddhist paraphernalia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One man who was studying with one of the Gilead graduates always kindly provided some food each week after the study, which food was first offered to the Buddhist idol in the home by the wife. After a few studies this practice was stopped and later the idol removed, all without any mention on the part of the brother. Now the man is a regular Kingdom publisher worshiping Jehovah God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of World War II the island of Tai Wan (Formosa) again came under Chinese rule after many years of Japanese occupation. We had no knowledge of any preaching being done on the island or of any publishers there. One brother moved from Shanghai to Tai Wan to take up work as a teacher, and soon reports began to reach him that there were some brethren on the island. Later three brethren visited him from the Ami tribe living in the remote eastern part of the island. These brethren said there were about 200 of their tribe in the truth and that they were having much difficulty In carrying on their worship of Jehovah. Arrangements were made through the Brooklyn Office for the Branch servant at Shanghai to visit these brethren, and a visit was made during April. The journey took four days to reach the Pacific side of the island where the brethren live. On arrival at the main village, which is composed of mud huts, the Branch servant was met by many smiling and happy native brethren, and during the course of the next tw’o days a total of six hundred Ami tribe brethren visited the village to meet the visitor. It was only at this time that the full history of The Theocracy in Tai Wan was learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1939 two Japanese pioneers arrived in Tai Wan from Japan and began to witness systematically, covering the whole island. Then when Japan banned Jehovah’s witnesses these two pioneers were arrested and imprisoned. But the gospel had reached the Ami tribe first and many had attended the meetings held by the pioneers. At a baptismal service arranged by the pioneers, 200 symbolized their consecration by water immersion. Then came the official ban, many were imprisoned, some for three years, but they held on to their new faith. Parents instructed their children in the truth, all by word of mouth, as there was no literature available, not even the Bible. Whole families accepted the truth and spread the good news to their neighbors, and soon a large percentage of each village embraced the true worship. When the war ended the brethren began to meet together again, but immediately they experienced opposition when the local religious group began to spread lies about the brethren, accusing them of immoral behavior, and of being connected with Japan. Upon the basis of these lies the Chinese government placed a ban on the assembling together of the brethren. The brethren have done everything they could to get the ban lifted, and they have willingly contributed their money to this end, but to no avail and the ban still exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the time the Branch servant was with the brethren many meetings were held. It was necessary to have all talks translated first into Japanese and then into the Ami language. The village hall was packed out for each meeting and all were very attentive as they heard about the progress of the Lord’s organization, and especially of Brother Knorr’s visits to all the different nations. All expressed their determination to serve the Lord faithfully come what may, as the oldest sister, 85 years of age, said, “It does not matter what happens in the future, we will be faithful to Jehovah. Our only hope is in the new world.” After the meetings a total of 260 brethren were immersed, most of them being just young children when the Japanese pioneers visited the district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much time was spent in instructing the brethren on how to conduct their meetings, and how to organize for field service. Visits were made to local government officials in an effort to get the ban lifted. Upon presentation of the facts, and explanation of our work, the officials expressed themselves favorably, and thought the ban should be lifted; however, religious pressure is still being used and up to today the ban has not been lifted. But this has not deterred the brethren, and they are going ahead with some meetings, and during August 66 brethren shared in the house-to-house and back-call activity, this being the first time this work has been done in Tai Wan since 1939. No doubt that with freedom to assemble together there will be a big increase in Tai Wan, as there is very much interest evident everywhere. We pray that the Lord will make it possible for the truth to spread more freely in that land, for with freedom to operate there will be no lack in willing workers to take the good news of the established Kingdom to the truth-hungry people of Tai Wan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our year began with 13 active publishers and ended with a peak of 92 publishers. It is the hope of all the brethren that the Lord will prosper their efforts, to the one end, that more and more will join in this life-giving song to the nations in vindication of the name of Jehovah and his universal supremacy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most progressive countries in South America is Colombia. It is believed that the people here will take to the truth as much as any other group of people in the world. In order to find the people of good-will, there must be preachers, as Paul stated at Romans chapter 10. The Society has tried diligently for the last three years to carry on the preaching work in Colombia, and sent many ministers, but for some reason or other many of the missionaries who were sent to Colombia have ceased their service. It must be said that a number did get sick and had to return to the United States, but a few of the individuals did not keep their eye on the Kingdom and the glorious treasures of service that they had, but rather got interested in the things of this world and relapsed into sin. Principally because of this the work has stood still. There are just a few faithful missionaries still remaining, and they are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to carry on the work there at all costs. The ministerial work of Jehovah’s witnesses as a whole cannot be judged by just a few who have “stopped”, but the few who have taken up the ministry and then failed can certainly bring a reflection on the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How true Paul’s words were when describing the race he was in. He did not run uncertainly; he did not fight by just beating the air, but, he said: “I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.” (1 Cor. 9:27, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font7">The Lord’s arm is not shortened, and this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached, but not by those who were rejected because they did not keep their bodies under subjection. Being a minister of God truly means being sanctified unto righteousness. Those who serve sin reap the wages sin pays, namely,' death. Serving righteousness brings eternal life. The brethren still remaining in Colombia are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to serve righteousness, and, by the Lord’s grace, we will send more ministers. The Branch servant gives us an interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the service year ended the Branch compiled its yearly reports and looked back over the third year’s activity since the arrival of the first Gilead graduates in Colombia. The results were meager. Of 22 missionaries that had been sent into the country only 8 remained. Sickness, marriage and worldliness had cut into their ranks. In April, after a stimulating Memorial celebration and peak in publishers the month before, came the disturbances that rocked Colombia’s capital. Curfews, food shortages and fear of more political trouble, along with martial law, combined to minimize the activity of the company publishers. But Colombia has not been without its joys of blessed Kingdom experiences that make glad our hearts and strengthen us in our determination to hunt out the “other sheep” that are scattered throughout Colombia’s ten million inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">120 hours a month! The new arrangement for general pioneers was a ray of hope for prospective pioneers who would have to cope with an extremely high cost of living. Taking advantage of such, one of Bogota’s most regular publishers fulfilled his desire to be a pioneer on January 1. A few months later the pesos that lie had saved were gone but his desire to continue pioneering had become stronger. Hence, six mornings a week find him working as a cabinetmaker, afternoons and evenings as a minister. Now at the end of the service year we find our first native Colombian pioneer with eight months’ experience behind him and blessed service privileges awaiting him in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the hot coastal city of Barranquilla comes a heartwarming experience. A revisit on a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscriber resulted in a book study. After six studies she readily agreed to go along in group witnessing. The following month, July, she was consecrated and demonstrated such step by water immersion and 66 hours of field-service activity. August saw her dedicating herself to all features of the work, conducting five book studies and participating in the street magazine work. Her 116 hours during the month spent preaching the Kingdom message shows the zeal manifest by many who are becoming a part of the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another item of interest from Barranquilla. The group of witnesses were off to their Sunday morning territory. A “senora” approached and asked if they were the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">people, and if they had any more of the books such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font6"> which she had already obtained. Then and there she subscribed for the Spanish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and soon was enjoying a book study in her home. What is she doing now? Why, visiting other persons who are as desirous of knowing about the New World as she was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From another part of the country we are happy to see that an isolated publisher, who has been reporting regularly for over two years, has a companion with him in the service, as fruitage of his ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of a new fiscal year we are encouraged by the correspondence that is being received at the Branch office from scattered parts of the country, letters expressing appreciation for the truth, requesting more literature and inquiring about the manner of spreading the gospel to others. That, too, is the attitude of the 8 missionaries that remain. They are determined that, by God’s grace, the number of Kingdom publishers will not level off but will soar to new heights with dozens of new publishers in the coming service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It was in the month of March, 1944, that the Branch organization was begun in Costa Rica. The work in that country has been on the increase from that time onward. The first month’s report that the Branch received in 1944 was from 155 publishers. For the 1948 service year they averaged 637 publishers, with a new peak of 915 publishers. The increase in the last year alone was 41 percent in number of publishers. The brethren associated at the Branch and the pioneers sent there from Gilead can rejoice with all their fellow ministers in that land because of Jehovah’s rich blessing upon them. Certainly they have been singing the praises of the Most High more and more and are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to make the 1949 service year even better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of the revolution during the months of March and April the brethren were able to obtain more subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> than in the previous year. Number of hours spent in the field service was much greater, and back-calls increased approximately 10,000 over last year. Book studies are about 150 ahead of the previous year; public meetings are on the advance. Costa Rica is hearing the message concerning the Kingdom. The Branch servant who has been there since the start of the work in that country sends in a very interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the past five years the work of gospel-preaching has been on the increase here in this small Central American republic. The publishers of The Theocracy have grown In numbers and in efficiency. Truly Jehovah’s witnesses of this land are ‘singing his praises among the nations’. They do so gladly and in unity. Fair weather or foul they are busy being ‘about their Father’s business’. Such steadfastness has brought results, to the end that on the average 188 more Costa Ricans were added to the list of ‘praise singers’ during the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This same zeal for the Kingdom has brought results of another nature also: these in the form of attacks by the religious press and radio upon this faithful band of gospel singers. One attack accused the witnesses of being anticonstitution, without respect for law and order and against (he different departments of state. In the same article, however, the writer, a Roman Catholic priest, had to admit that neither the blazing heat of the summer nor the torrential rains of the winter were enough to stop their onward march. He also stated that no sacrifice was too great and that negative answers and slams were not taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More vile in their attacks than the Catholics are the Evangelicals. Their local paper carries series of attacks on the witnesses and what they believe. None of this has dampened the zeal of servants of the Most High, but it is an assurance that we are right and that the opposers of truth and righteousness must manifest themselves against God's true ministers. The onward march of gospel-preaching in Costa Rica cannot be stopped by mere man, and every day sees new frontiers opened up to the work as more men, women and children throughout the length and breadth of the land take up the glad song, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the management of the United Fruit Company’s Golfito division offered us a place to hold our meetings when the Branch servant visited there in August of 1947, when the time came to organize the newly formed company there they refused us any kind of place that would do for a Kingdom Hall. In spite of this negative action on the part of the management, the company was formed early in the year and the report for August showed 8 company publishers had taken part in the field service. This is a tremendous field for Kingdom activities and the three or four pioneers that have been there since November are not able to take care of all the new interest. One pioneer reports that people come to meet them as they approach the outlying farms, to ask for book studies. So far the pioneers have done mostly book-placing and have not taken care of all the interest that they could. However, now through the efforts of one of the pioneers a meeting-place is being established and arrangements are being made to take care of this good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Montezuma, on the tip of Nicoya peninsula, was organized into a company In February with 17 publishers reporting the first month. This company was formed through the efforts of a lone general pioneer working out of the Puntarenas company. The company has grown to 40 publishers and consists of three isolated groups, each with a meeting-place and all reporting to the company headquarters in Montezuma. This Is mountainous country and the territory consists of all rural territory. To get to their territory the brethren go either on horseback or on foot over the mountain trails. Some of the brethren from there have attended the last two circuit assemblies as well as the district assembly and show much zeal and enthusiasm for the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit arrangement, with its semiannual assemblies, has continued to be a great benefit to the brethren. The Spanish assembly held in San Jos6 last September was one that will long be remembered by the Costa Rican brethren. More than 500 persons attended the public meeting on Sunday afternoon. This too was the first time that an assembly was held in its entirety in a hall rented especially for the event. Heretofore our Kingdom Hall was used for such assemblies, with the exception of the public meeting. With the growth in numbers in the Spanish circuit our San Jose Kingdom Hall will not begin to accommodate all attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The English assembly was scheduled for Port Limon in October. The English-speaking brethren, not to be outdone by the brethren in the Spanish circuit, did a wonderful job of advertising the public meeting to be held in the U. N. I. A. Hall. As a result more than 500 attended, thus making a total of more than 1,000 persons to hear “My Kingdom Not of This World”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Spanish circuit much progress has been made due to the regular visits of the circuit servant. Here companies are located far apart and the only means of getting to several of them is by air. Living conditions are bad, too. Brother Blackburn has to sleep on the floor for stretches of three weeks at a time while serving out in Guanacaste province, many times without even a blanket to cover himself. So he sleeps with his clothes on or even puts on some extra clothing to keep out the cold mountain air. The water is bad in most cases, and as a result he comes home with amoebae after each trip of any length. The brethren in these places are poor in the goods of this world, yet they offer the best they have in return for instruction and admonition that will make them rich with a lasting treasure. Many have had little or no schooling, yet they are progressing in their Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A heavy schedule was planned for Brother Steelman in Costa Rica. He first served the San Josd company for a week, and it was this visit that gave us the push to get the 260 publishers that reported for August. As he left for Siquirres we wondered what results would be had there. The company had shown a peak of 41 publishers in August of 1947, and since that time had not been able to reach it. The news soon traveled back to the San Josd office that Brother Steelman had reports for more than 50 publishers, and, when the report came in for August, 57 publishers had reported time in the field. The next stop would be Port Lim6n. Would he be able to aid the brethren to get out 100 publishers? The report for August showed that 138 publishers had been active in addition to the three pioneers working with the company. With San Jose well over the 200 mark by the middle of the month, this meant that we could forget our desired peak of 700 publishers and work for even a higher one. Would we hit 800? More good reports continued to come in. Waldeck reported the unheard-of number of 40 publishers. The visit to Turrialba netted 3 more new ones in addition to the 10 faithful publishers left there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now to the Pacific side. What would be accomplished in Puntarenas? True, they reported 77 publishers in January, but that was before the Montezuma publishers were formed into their own company. After a week’s work in this Pacific port 90 publishers had reported to set an all-time high for the Puntarenas company. Grecia was the only visit yet to be made before the district assembly in San Jos6. Would these brethren respond? When the report came in it'showed 8 publishers. This was not a new peak, but it showed that some of the irregular publishers had been awakened to their privileges of service. With all these reports we knew that the final total would be near the 900 mark. The company servants and the pioneers had been notified to bring their August field service reports to the assembly in San Jose so that the results for August could be announced. Everyone had worked hard and all expected to hear a new peak announced. They were not disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As in all assemblies of the Lord’s people, the last day and the last session are always the most lively. This was no exception, and, to add to the enthusiasm of the occasion, Brother Steelman at the close of his public talk released for the first time in Costa Rica the Spanish edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People.</span><span class="font6"> This was a surprise to all and keyed them up for our visitor’s final and closing remarks. This was the time scheduled to make the announcement that all had been waiting for: how many publishers did we have in August? It was a well-known fact that all had worked hard and that almost every company had made a new peak. When the announcement was made that the peak was 915 publishers the joy of the brethren could not be contained as they applauded long and loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So it is with joy in our hearts and a song of praise on our lips that we look back over the past five years with their many blessings on the Kingdom work in this land where religion holds sway. We give thanks to Jehovah for the privilege we have had in loosening the bonds of those who have come to associate with his people. As we look ahead, we can see even greater privileges and blessings as we continue to help yet others come out from under the yoke of bondage that has the world in darkness. It is our desire to continue to point the people to the “Signal” by continuing to “sing praises among the nations”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s servants in Cuba have diligently pushed forward in the service, doing their share in spreading the song of praise among all nations. The Cubans have certainly taken to the truth. Many of the Lord’s “other sheep” are in that land, and it is good to see an increase of 36 percent in number of publishers. Companies are organized in the circuit arrangement, and the circuit assemblies have been a great aid to the ministers in Cuba, not only in spirtual refreshment but also in showing them the ways and means of carrying out the Kingdom work with greatest efficiency. Even though Cuba reached a new peak of publishers of 4,782, there are still many closely associated with the companies who are not yet publishers. This was indicated by the Memorial attendance, when 7,204 were present. This was an increase of 2,500 over last year’s attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year’s activities in Cuba were climaxed with the first district assembly, which was held in Havana. The program was similar to that used in the United States. It was clearly evident from the start that this assembly was one of instruction and counsel. It showed the practical side of Christian life. The Cubans are taking full advantage of this instruction in expanding their ministry. An enthusiastic public meeting was arranged, and there were 2,569 persons present. The high-lights of the year are well reported by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The increased public meeting activity played a great part in the advance. The number of public meetings held, 2,136, is an increase of almost eighty percent over last year. During the year outdoor public meetings, especially in public parks, were stressed. The results obtained from these meetings were excellent. Concerning this, one company servant writes, “All during the week we worked hard in announcing our public talk in the park, passing out handbills as well as giving a verbal Invitation to attend our meeting. And the Lord blessed our efforts. Over 2,000 people heard our public talk! And now, after this public meeting, on going from door to door, many people, both Catholics and Baptists, congratulated us on the meeting and asked us when we would have the next one. Many of them offered to have studies with us. All of this resulted in a great witness to the honor and glory of Jehovah.” Attendances of 400 and 500 persons at our public meetings in parks are very common. The brethren, realizing the importance of the public meeting work, have enthusiastically pushed this feature. Over a sixmonth period one company held 59 public meetings, another company held 55, and another one held 54! Our press printed close to 4,000,000 handbills in comparison with last year’s figure of 2,500,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of companies increased from 91 to 121, and as a result two new circuits were organized. One of these circuits was organized in the province of Pinar del Rio. Seven years ago in this province there was only one single publisher publishing the Kingdom message; now there are 977 publishers, in 27 companies. Just as the Lord said, &quot;A little one shall become a thousand.” The publishers in that province average one publisher for every 400 inhabitants. The first assembly for this new circuit was held in the city of Pinar del Rio. The people of that city, who had thought there were just a few of Jehovah's witnesses, got the surprise of their lives on the Saturday afternoon of the assembly, when they saw all the streets of the city completely blanketed with Kingdom publishers using placards and handbills announcing the public talk. A marvelous witness was given there. The company servant in that city says that the people there are still talking about the assembly. As a result of the assembly the Pinar del Rio company jumped from 43 publishers to a new peak of 69.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that assembly a young pioneer related a very interesting experience. He told that before coming to a knowledge of the truth he could neither read nor write. After coming to a knowledge of the truth through a verbal testimony and association with the brethren, he saw the need of entering the pioneer service. After entering the pioneer service he began to learn how to read and write so that he might be better equipped for the service. After learning to read he met a group of interested persons in his territory, and started a book study with them. As a result of this study fourteen new publishers have started out in the service, and a number of these were baptized at this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two more new units were organized in the Habana area. One of these new units increased from 116 publishers to 200 publishers in seven months’ time. Including the pioneers, there are now more than 850 publishers in the six units in the Habana area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of this writing, arrangements are being completed to send two groups of missionaries from this country to two other Spanish-speaking countries where more workers are needed. One of these groups worked in Habana, and did an excellent work in their territory. Not only did they aid many new ones in the service, but they also aided many of those who were irregular publishers to become strong, regular publishers. The other group worked in the city of Camaguey. They also accomplished an excellent work in their assignment. When they first went to Camaguey there was a weak company of five publishers there. Now Cama-guey has a strong company of 114 publishers, as well as 7 pioneers. The Cuban brethren greatly appreciated the aid given to them by these graduates of Gilead, and they wish them the Lord’s rich blessing in their new assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new arrangement for pioneers opened up the way for many to enter into the full-time service. Since the new arrangement went into effect over 150 new pioneers have enrolled. At the present, we have 372 pioneers on our list, which number is nine percent of our average number of publishers for the year. Many of the companies have gone over their goal of ten percent of the publishers enrolled as pioneers. One company that reports 168 publishers has 33 pioneers, which number ife twenty-two percent of its publishers. The pioneers have expressed great satisfaction with the new arrangement. They feel that now they will be able to meet the new requirements as well as take care of their financial needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of brethren were arrested during the year. In Mayan seventeen brethren were arrested for holding a public meeting without the permission of the local mayor. A good witness was given at the court trial of these brethren. These brethren were freed when this case was decided in our favor. In La Palma four brethren were arrested and were sent off to prison for four months by a prejudiced judge. Since there is no appeal from this court, the only recourse that these brethren had was to request that an amnesty or pardon be granted to them. This amnesty was not granted to them. These brethren took advantage of their imprisonment by witnessing to the inmates of the prison. They were also allowed to hold a weekly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study, inviting the inmates to attend. They also had the opportunity of putting on a series of public meetings inside the prison. As in past years, many brethren were given short prison sentences because they refrained from voting. While not interfering with or advocating against voting by other persons, these Cuban brethren refrain from voting as do Jehovah’s consecrated servants In countries where suffrage is not compulsory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers here in Cuba give thanks to the Lord for the many opportunities granted them of expanding Jehovah’s worship among the inhabitants of this land. Unitedly they will continue to move forward with their brethren In other lands in singing Jehovah’s praises among the nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is good to hear from our Korean brethren again and assist them in getting organized for Kingdom service. In 1939 the work in Korea was completely disrupted when the Japanese arrested many of the brethren and put them in concentration camps. Particularly in Korea cruel shackles were used by the Japanese guards, twisting the arms of the brethren to force them, if possible, to worship the emperor. The fact that many died in imprisonment is a testimony to their faith in Jehovah, who alone can give eternal life. At the end of the war and the surrender of the Japanese forces, the brethren who still remained alive in prison were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the Korean brethren had the thought that the door to the antitypical ark was already closed and they need only await the reward of faithfulness, but, upon hearing of the continually expanding work of praise, they quickly expressed their eagerness to have a share. As many as 20 brethren have joined in a weekly study group, and new ones are constantly showing interest in the work. Since the war 38 new brethren have been baptized and the work has gone ahead, despite the fact that the publishers have been out of communication with the Society until just recently. Supplies of literature are being sent to the brethren in Korea, and arrangements have been made for the translation of a new publication in Korean. The brethren in Korea give joyous thanks to Jehovah for carrying them safely through the trials of the past to the open door of service that is before them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The British Empire controls Cyprus as an island colony. It has a population of 350,000 Greek-speaking people. The Greek Orthodox Church is trying to maintain her hold on the people as in the days of old, but Communism is making a very strong bid to break many of the people away from the church. While</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">these two factions war one against the other as they are doing in Greece, Jehovah’s witnesses go ahead preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The past service year in Cyprus was the best yet. A new Branch was established on this island during the year so that closer supervision could be given to the work being carried on there. This has resulted in a very fine increase. Two new companies have been organized; we now have a total of seven. There has been a 60-percent increase in number of publishers and a new peak was reached of 86 who are serving the interests of the Kingdom. Over 10 percent of the publishers are pioneers; so we see the brethren are off to a good start. The Branch servant sent in a very interesting report which shows the real opposition that the Greek Church is putting up against the good news of the Kingdom. They should know by now that it is unwise to fight against God and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servant to the brethren visits have been a help to the companies, and it is interesting to note that he followed the path that Paul and Barnabas blazed as they served in a similar capacity when they were in Cyprus in the days of the early church. They started from the city of Salamis and stopped at several places along the coast until they came to the city of Paphos. (Acts 13:4-6) So the servant to the brethren started at a city on the outskirts of the ruins of Salamis and served the company there; visited two other companies along the coast, and finally stopped at the company in Paphos before going inland. While there an exceptionally good time was had, with over 2,000 booklets being placed in two days of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The island has served also as a refuge for three Gilead graduates in the Near East: one English graduate of Gilead being deported from Egypt, and the other two American Gilead ministers sent out from Greece. Cyprus was the only place that they could go without returning to the United States or to England. Now there are four of them with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These brethren have been of assistance in the expansion work and, as is to be expected, we have had much opposition from the church. Especially was this so at our circuit assembly, where many children of school age were sent by their religious teachers to cause us trouble. They raised a terrific fuss outside the hall during the public lecture, by beating tin cans, whistling, howling, singing religious songs, and throwing stones, and even carrying sandwich signs in front of the hall. However, inside the speaker was not affected by the noise, and over 300 people heard the lecture to the finish. Later a protest was made to the police and school authorities, with the latter launching an investigation to ascertain who were the children involved, in order to expel them from school. No children were expelled, but a great witness was given to all the schools during the investigation and the children were instructed not to disturb us again. The newspapers carried reports of the assembly, adding to the witness being given. One of the Church-influenced newspapers, of course, gave a lopsided account of the affair. They had, as required by law, to reprint a letter from the Society setting them straight on what took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a result of the increased witnessing activity the Orthodox Church sent out an encyclical against Jehovah’s witnesses. This was even printed in many of the daily newspapers on the island. Copies of it were sent to all the churches and read therein; children were sent out to distribute these from door to door and to stick them on the walls and telephone poles and to get them generally all over the place. This all back-fired on the Church, because people who had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses just did not know what was happening and wanted to know who they were. Every nook and corner of the island knows something about Jehovah’s witnesses, whether good or bad, as a result of this advertising and the expanded praise on the part of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though the island had been well covered with the literature before, the Society decided to distribute Greek booklets to the people so that they could read for themselves who we were, now that this curiosity had been raised. At the above-mentioned assembly, announcement was made of a four-month booklet campaign for the summer months, and a quota of 70,000 booklets was set. Many doubted that this many booklets could be distributed in such a short time when last year a total of only 12,000 pieces of literature had been placed. However, the blessing of the Lord was richly on this campaign, for when it was completed over 72,000 booklets were in the hands of the people. Now many who had never read our literature before were doing so out of curiosity and many were the expressions that “this literature is not bad”; “It is the truth, all that they say,” and similar favorable comments. Some of the people have been drawn closer to the organization, and it is hoped that they will soon be associated with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another view as to how effective this booklet campaign was can be seen when the Synod of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus held a meeting and one of the subjects discussed was the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. The following statement of the Synod carried in the newspaper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font6"> of July 14, 1948, is revealing. “The Holy Synod of the Cyprus Orthodox Church met on Monday and Tuesday. . . . The Holy Synod has taken note of the anti-Orthodox propaganda of the followers of Jehovah and we have decided to take certain measures against them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later, during the same week that the Synod had released this statement to the press, two of the Gilead graduates had been invited to the archbishop’s palace to have a discussion on the “trinity” with one of the theologians, which discussion had been requested and arranged for by an influential person of good-will. The theologian priest went to great lengths to establish at the beginning of the discussion that the Church accepted the traditions of the fathers as handed down by the various Synods in the past and that he, even if he saw what the Bible might show to be otherwise, would still support the traditions of the Church. And he certainly did. When Colossians 1:15 was produced he immediately exclaimed, “That is the heresy of Arlus!” Many other scriptures were presented but all of these were covered over by the priest maintaining that this was the way that we took the Scriptures, but the Church through her tradition had taken it to mean otherwise and that there was a trinity. This is the same Church that claims that Barnabas, a Cyprian and a companion of Paul, was its first archbishop! Well did Jesus say of these modern-day Pharisees, at Matthew 15:3, 6-9 (A.S.V.), “Ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.” Unfortunately the person of good-will sided with the priest and also chose the fables of tradition rather than the pure truths of God’s Word as his guide.—2 Timothy 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now it remains to be seen what the Church plans to do against the Lord’s people who, to be sure, are not going to sit down and wait. No I Arrangements have been made to have a large public meeting campaign early in the new service year with all the companies delivering talks all over the island. This feature of service is most effective in Cyprus because a large number of the people are illiterate. Already the Church has expressed herself saying that they will tolerate our passing out literature but they will not stand for our delivering talks to deceive the unlearned people (which people, by the way, she has kept illiterate, as she controls the schools) and that they will destroy us as in the days of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the coming service year should prove to be a very interesting one. We are grateful to the Lord for the increase that he has given us during the past year and we feel sure that the coming year will see more of the “other sheep” flocking to the fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year just past has been a rich one for Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia, but it meant changes in the political and economic world for the people of the country. These changes in the country also meant stirring times for the Lord’s servants, but, in spite of tough fights and various difficulties, the time has been a joyous one. The circuit assemblies were a great refreshment and stimulus both to the companies as a whole and to the individual brethren. There were many newly interested persons of goodwill who ventured their first steps into field service at these assemblies, and after each circuit assembly increased activity was seen.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font7">Czechoslovakia reached a new peak of 1,991 publishers, and on the average there was a 25-percent increase in number of ministers serving the interests of the Kingdom throughout the land. One of the big difficulties during the year was that of supplying the brethren with literature. There was a general shortage of paper in the land because Czechoslovakia has been more anxious to sell its paper outside the country than to local buyers. Brooklyn, however, was able to send large quantities to aid in this time of need. Excellent work is being done in the back-call service. Nearly 30,000 more back-calls were made during the year than in the previous one, and 613 book studies are being conducted regularly. Public meetings played a big part in the general witness given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The splendid advance in the proclamation of the Kingdom has certainly stirred up the clergy, and the Branch servant at Prague gives us an interesting report on just how they feel and what they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When In September the Branch servant calculated the quotas for this country for the new service year—whicii were to be 10-percent higher than the averages obtained in the year just finished—the question forced itself upon him, Will we be able to reach the goal set? How gratifying it Is then to see from the field service reports that we are keeping in step month by month, and to experience the joy of achievement at the end of the service year, knowing that not only has the goal set been reached, but that we also hit a 25-percent Increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proclamation work In Slovakia, as in former years, has had hard opposition to contend with during the past year from the religious clergy, who have put many hindrances in the way of the preaching of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During World War II, under the rule of the Roman Catholic prelate Tiso, Jehovah’s witnesses were decried as communists by the clergy in Slovakia as in all other countries that were under the Influence of German Nazidom. Jehovah’s witnesses were forced underground during this time, when they carried out the work of preaching “this gospel” entrusted to them, by other means and under great difficulties. When hostilities ceased among the nations and the Czechoslovakian republic received new life, the Slovakian authorities gave permission for the activity of the International Bible Students Association, which is the servant of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the brethren were again free to exercise their right of true worship. The zealous and untiring evangelical work of this company of true servants of God was a thorn In the flesh of the Slovakian clergy, and they published their slanderous articles against the witnesses of the Most High ever more frequently in their press. It seemed that their distorted and often purely Invented reports awoke the attention of honest people and opened the eyes of many to recognize the untarnished truths of God’s Word. Hence the clergy have stooped to another weapon of late. Just as during the war they idecrled Jehovah’s witnesses as communists, so now they endeavor to persuade responsible authorities in this country that Jehovah’s witnesses are against the communist regime and are supporting the right-wing elements In the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy In Slovakia know full well the attitude of this peace-loving community of Jehovah’s witnesses who take no part in politics, and know full well too that Jehovah’s witnesses do not aspire for political power in any nation. The very contrary can be justly said of the clergy themselves. Their charges are willfully false pretexts, the true reason being to silence the preaching of the gospel. These false accusations have done much to injure the work of proclamation of the Kingdom In recent months In Slovakia, and the brethren have come into a very difficult situation. The religious leaders fight against God and pile up further blame and responsibility upon the heap of their iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia are fully aware of their obligations in the time of the end of this old world, and they are determined to continue in this blessed service heedless of all difficulties. They will continue to preach the gospel and to visit all people who wish to learn the truth out </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of</span><span class="font6"> God’s Word. They know that persistent, faithful service guarantees their salvation and serves to the deliverance of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We cannot close this report without expressing our gratitude for the gifts sent by the brethren in the United States and Canada to their fellow publishers in Czechoslovakia. In winter we received 300 CARE food parcels which in the first place were used to assist the pioneers and the members of the Bethel family, and then also needy company publishers. Later a second consignment arrived containing more than five tons of clothing, linen and shoes. Again the fulltime workers were remembered first, but a large quantity of clothing also reached other faithful company publishers. We take this opportunity of conveying our warm thanks to the givers as expressed in all the letters received at the Branch here from the grateful receivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year just past has been a further year of Increase in the most sublime service that has ever been bestowed upon mankind. We commence the new year in the fervent hope that, by the Lord’s grace, the work of praising Jehovah’s holy name will not be retarded, but will receive the full measure of his blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a happy and busy time for all of the brethren in Denmark. Splendid advance has been made in the field-service work during the year, and the country enjoyed a 17-percent increase in number of publishers. This is attributed to the circuit assemblies and the district assembly which were held during the year. The brethren have received excellent instruction and have become more skilled publishers, wielding the “sword of the spirit” with greater efficiency. Hours in the field have increased greatly, over 29 percent; back-calls jumped from 112,144 to 137,200; and book studies, from 863 to 1,023. All this had a telling effect on the new interest which was manifest in Denmark during the year as many people took their stand on the Lord’s side. The Branch servant brings out some points concerning the ministers in Denmark which the readers of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> will find interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In connection with the improvement in the work generally, one point is worthy of mention. In Denmark July is the great holiday month and the number of publishers has usually dropped very much. It has been a holiday not only from ordinary work but, in the case of many, also from witnessing. For example, in July 1946 and 1947 the numbers of publishers dropped to 2,396 and 2,381 respectively. Accordingly, it was suggested in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> this year that holidays meant freedom from our usual work and, therefore, provided us with more and better opportunities for proclaiming “this gospel of the kingdom”. In the result we had 3,177 in the field, an increase of 796 over last year, and the hours jumped up for the month over 13,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the Memorial there were 4,550 in attendance, to compare with 3,961 last year, and 263 partook of the symbols. One by one the anointed pass away and are changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the district assembly in June we had a new peak of 4,148 at the public meeting on Sunday afternoon, and in the evening there were 3,834 present. The pioneer service was specially stressed at this assembly and particularly that the reduced number of hours per month, viz., 120, or 1400 for the whole year, made it possible for more of the brethren to share in this feature of the work besides having other employment. In the result more brethren came forward in the last two months than previously, so that in August, including 9 holiday pioneers, we reached a new peak of 113 in the field, to compare with an average of 64 for the year. Last year’s peak was 53, and the average 32. During the holiday months 32 different brethren took part in the work as holiday pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is wonderful to think, too, of all the public meetings held all around the globe with the same message outlined by the organization. These must have a great influence upon the strangers present, who are doubtless prepared in the result to give a more kindly reception to Jehovah’s witnesses when they call on them later. We had 1,237 public meetings this year, as against 1,082 in the previous year, and that gives practically an average of eight meetings apiece for each of the 158 companies in the land. Without doubt the emphatic presentation of the message in an orderly, Biblical and logical manner is a great help to people of good-will. Thus we live in a day when we experience the fulfillment of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zechariah’s prophecy: “Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year a further group of five brethren were called over to Gilead, to their great joy. Three were from our small office and two from among the servants to the brethren, and it was no easy job filling their places. However, the Lord saw to it that all needed help was found and we were glad that our brethren had the opportunity of going to Gilead, there to share in the preparation for the still further expansion of the Kingdom work. There is no doubt that it was in the Lord’s providence that Gilead was provided so that hundreds of young brothers and sisters could be better fitted to carry the message to the ends of the earth. Our earnest prayers continually ascend for Jehovah’s blessing on the school and on all the inhabitants of that blessed square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Street witnessing has been going on regularly throughout the year and quite a lot of literature is placed In this way. At the same time a splendid advertisement of the magazines is given, which aids us in the door-to-door work. At present the paper situation is very difficult, but we hope that in the Lord’s providence we shall be able to get sufficient supplies for the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Praying Jehovah’s blessing may continue upon you and all your colaborers, the Bethel family ask me to send you their warm love and greetings. With the psalmist we cry: “Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The people on the island of Santo Domingo are very religious; however, some are heeding the message of the Kingdom and proclaiming it. Excellent increase has been achieved during the year, but not without the usual interference from the Hierarchy. These Catholic countries do not want their peoplfc to read the Bible; for, if they do, they will soon turn away from the traditions of men. The greater portion of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Dominican Republic has taken place in three cities: Ciudad Trujillo, Santiago and San Pedro de Macoris. Gilead graduates are located in each of these three cities and company organizations have been started. It is hoped that during the year the publishers will be able to reach out into new fields and gradually spread the truth all over the island. It takes time, but, by the Lord’s grace, the “other sheep” will be found. The Branch servant gives us some interesting side-lights on what is taking place on this island in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was three years ago when the first Gilead graduates arrived in this land to start giving the witness. Prior to that time the witness work here was unknown. More brethren from Gilead arrived shortly thereafter, until now there are eighteen working, and a Branch office has been operating for more than two years. The increase has been slow, however steady. During the past service year the increase has continued, though not as rapidly as in some countries. Speaking only of the native brethren, and excluding from the figures the Gilead missionaries, there were, on the average, 110 publishers working every month for the past year, of whom 6 were pioneers. This is an Increase from a monthly average of 40 for the previous year, 2 of whom were pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Progress is seen in that the native brethren are becoming more dependable and are Increasing their individual activity. By Jehovah’s grace, the witness work Is established upon firm and healthy foundations, and according to his will It will increase so that more and more join in singing his praises to the vindication of his name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To carry on the witness work, especially in towns in the Interior, more pioneers are needed. The new arrangement for pioneers to do secular work Is manifestly a provision of the Lord, and many of the brethren here, upon becoming more mindful of their privileges, find it possible to be pioneers as well as housewives, carpenters, or bookkeepers. At this writing we have 9, and we will start the new service year with 12. We hope that it will be possible for these brethren to carry the witness to towns in the interior where the work has not as yet been done efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though our placements of books and booklets have dropped down, sufficient have been left to make the religionists complain. Typical of articles In the Catholic press Is the following, published under the heading: “Danger of Death! Jehovah’s witnesses! Don’t touch!” The article follows: “Danger of death! You see this written on electric plants. I would put this sign on the threshold of the houses of protestants. I am going to show you one of such dangers: the most to be feared protestant cult, and the most dangerous, is that of Jehovah’s witnesses. Hear the true story . . . their founder was an American commercialist named Charles Taze Russel. Their sect was run out of the United States for being antisocial, and planted Its roots in Mexico . . . their doctrine is truly antisocial, poisonous, and a danger for the nations . . . they cause true ravage among the public and launch the most violent attacks against Catholicism and the rudest offenses against the Pope . . . Catholic! Alert! Don’t touch! Danger of Death !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A series of semi-public Bible talks was run in a small town where a local brother had been carrying on activity for a number of months with great blessings. The attendance was good throughout. During the second talk, the local priest drove up and down in front of the meeting-place in his Jeep in order to demonstrate how intolerant and bigoted the Catholic church is, and to scare the people. At last he got sufficient courage to stop and warn that the talk was “very bad”, nevertheless the crowd remained and heard “The Truth About Jehovah’s witnesses”, as the talk was entitled. This procedure was repeated by this childish “father” during the remaining talks, but attendance continued to increase until it reached the 100 mark in this small town. The town was worked and much literature was placed. As a result of the local brother’s activity, local new Interest to the number of eight took part in this activity, their first witnessing. All together it was too much for the priest, who took the names of all in attendance that he recognized and the following week all who worked for the government lost their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the past years in which the work has been done, it has been a groundwork of laying the foundation. Book studies and the door-to-door feature have been the main methods. Many are the experiences in connection with the first placement, successive back-calls and book studies; and, finally, another “other sheep” is gathered into the fold as a publisher of the kingdom of the Good Shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Up until now, it has been necessary to use as servants in the companies the Gilead brethren, for the most part. However, the local brethren have progressed to where they are Scripturally becoming more and more qualified for these responsibilities. The Theocratic School is carried out as in other parts of the earth, and brothers, both young and old, are giving live, concise 6- to 8-mlnute talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is with eagerness that the new year of service is contemplated, and with the hope that all the brethren in the Dominican Republic can “advance into maturity” and always keep fully abreast of the increasing light of the Kingdom so as to discharge our responsibility which comes upon us for having heard the “singing of Jehovah’s praise among the nations” 1</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A newly established Branch in Egypt, along with all of the brethren there, rejoices in the expansion work that took place during the 1948 service year. The expansion was not without opposition. The Greek Orthodox Church was very much displeased with the progress being made, and tried to stop the message. The Greek newspapers are not independent or free, but they come under the strict control of the Greek hierarchy. This religious organization started a campaign of public talks in the churches against the witnesses of Jehovah, accusing them of being Communists or Zionists, and the papers have published these false statements. The campaign has even been carried into some of the schools that are under the control of the Greek hierarchy and some of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses have been dismissed. The Coptic (Egyptian Christian) Orthodox hierarchy is no better, nor is the Catholic Church in Egypt; but they all have made Jehovah’s witnesses their target. All this opposition has aroused the public, and they want to hear more. The campaign of public meetings has been successful, and 130 have been held by the brethren in various languages: Arabic, Greek, French, Italian and English. The many languages complicate the preaching work to some degree, but Jehovah’s witnesses know that the gospel must be proclaimed to all nations and in all tongues. The Branch servant gives us an interesting report of some of the things with which the brethren have to contend. However, they are not discouraged, but rejoice at their 41-percent increase and the new peak of 117 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank the Most High God for the privilege he gave ns to serve him, and for the abundant, rich blessings during this service year. The Egyptian Branch reached its first year of life. Indeed the blessings here proved once again that the visit last year of the president of the Society, Brother N. H. Knorr, accompanied by his secretary Brother M. G. Henschel, and the establishment of a Branch in this land, was a gracious provision from our heavenly Father, who never forgets his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The climax of the blessings from Jehovah was at the end of the service year which was closed by the district assembly held in Alexandria on August 20-22, and at which brethren from many parts of Egypt were present. There one could see clearly the blessings of Jehovah expressed in their faces by the unity, brotherhood, zeal and joy of the brethren. Our joy was great also, for 15 persons symbolized their consecration by water immersion during the assembly. The brethren were much pleased also when at the end of the district assembly they heard the field service report of the past 11 months, which report showed a great increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An effort of Satan to stop the proclamation of the kingdom of Christ was the following: When the order for the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in Arabic arrived here in Egypt, it was sent, as all other previous shipments, to the Ministry of Interior (Censorship Department) to be examined. The censor, a Moslem man, after examination gave an order to release the books; but another censor, a Coptic (Egyptian Christian) who is preaching in a Protestant organization and with whom I had discussed the “trinity” doctrine long ago, intervened and went directly to the director of the Censorship Department, who also is a Coptic and whose father was a priest and whose brother is now a priest. Being opposed to the truth, he spoke to the director against us, saying that the books are Zionistic because they contain the name “Jehovah” and are against religion because these books, he said, do not support the “trinity” doctrine. Then the director did not approve the release of our publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After that, the books were given to other Moslem censors for examination. One of these censors was pleased in reading the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> and particularly the chapter “Is There a Trinity?”. He invited some others and then explained to them all the arguments contained in this chapter proving that the “trinity” doctrine was not supported by the Bible. As it is known, Moslems do not believe in a triune God. The censors, after examination, made a report to the director. When we W’ent again to see the director, he said to us that the books would be given to a special committee of censors to be examined. But till this moment no definite answer has been given us. This matter of the censoring of the books caused a great witness to be given to all in the Ministry of the Interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the situation also now existing here due to the Palestine affair, some fear and nervousness prevailed among the people for a while. A few arrests of brothers and sisters have taken place while calling at the homes of the people, and the brothers and sisters were brought to the police stations. The police officers, after examination of the matter, left them free. Satan the Devil, the enemy of God and men, has been defeated in his efforts to frighten the publishers and stop the proclamation of God’s kingdom under Christ. The wonderful report of our brethren here in this land of the Nile proves that the guiding and protecting hand of Jehovah was over his people, helping them in their ministry and leading them triumphantly toward the desired end of gathering the “other sheep” of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are confident in Jehovah and in Christ Jesus, our King, that the coming new service year of 1949 will show a still greater increase and mightier witness to Jehovah God’s name, word and kingdom in our continued efforts in ‘singing praises unto him among the nations’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EL SALVADOR</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font7">El Salvador literally means “The Savior”. However, the Catholic religion has not saved the people nor this country from the evils that befall the world. Religion has rather been a terrible blight to the growth of this country in its struggle to live, sapping even to the last centavo the resources of the poor and needy to enrich itself. It is no wonder that many people brand the religious priests as “parasites”. Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to bring to this nation through their missionary service real education on the Bible. Good progress has been made in the few short years that the Watch Tower Society has had opportunity to carry on its work in that country. Now there are 151 regular publishers in the field, which is an increase of 88 percent over last year, and a new peak of 201 has been reached of brethren who have served in the field. That makes the cup of joy of the publishers in El Salvador truly overflow. The brethren from Gilead who serve in that land are happy that they are assigned there, for they see there is so much to do, and they want to do it. The report from the Branch servant gives us a look at the country through his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many thrilling service reports have come to the attention of the Branch office here in the capital, some of which we shall relate. Many readers of last year’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> under the report of El Salvador will remember the courageous stand taken by several blind men against this black Roman religion and her “princes of darkness” in favor of the light of truth. They continue steadfast and immovable. They sincerely live the truth, their lips are continually singing praises to the Creator. Three of them were baptized, showing their outward expression to do Jehovah’s will, during the year. One of them on his paper route has the city hospital, which is equipped with a personnel of Catholic nuns. These religious nuns become quite heated at times at this blind paperman because lie gets off the subject of selling papers and talks about God’s kingdom. In their wrath they have threatened him severely and have forbidden him to return. Of course, they have not frightened him, as his only fear is Jehovah and he is determined that those sick people hear about Jehovah, the real Savior, and his reigning Son, Christ Jesus. Even the local bishop was disturbed over such bold testimony and of this constant preaching; so he cooked up a scheme whereby the blind men could receive some sort of free Catholic training that would be more for their material benefit. (Something like the gift that was offered by the Devil to Christ in order to break his integrity.) But neither did these blind men fall for the trap of the bishop, but returned his summons with the answer that they were too busy doing their Father’s business which rendered them unable to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church claims to wield the sword of the Savior and to have put Christ amid the pagan Indians several centuries ago by the murderous Spanish conquerors. The facts show that the real Christ, the Son of the Almighty God, has not been known to them but rather only their form of demonism was changed for a kind even worse. Marriage does not exist as a sacred institution. The people are informed by the clergy that marriage is invalid without the performance of a priest, which involves a money consideration that the many poor people do not have. This has driven the peoples away from God and Christ Jesus, the real Saviors, instead of to them. The moral conditions are almost at their lowest; thousands of children have never seen their fathers; almost every family remains divided, even to each child’s having a different father and different surname. The people are not embarrassed over such things, for they exist as a common standard and practice among the people who have been robbed by the clergy, not only of their money but of knowledge of the trueness of a real family union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our convention was held in June during the visit of Brother Steelman from the Brooklyn office, on his trip through Central America. The results of his visit will never be forgotten in El Salvador, in that his visit seemed to have removed a mote in the eyes of many to see clearly the operating of Jehovah’s Theocratic Organization in the earth today. We are all looking anxiously to the time that again we will have a traveling representative of the Society with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s Word will never die out, by his grace, in this small land. The truth is taking the land as if by fire, a fire that cannot be stopped or extinguished. We have reports of people knowing of our work who live in such remote places where a car is seldom seen or the view of a city is a strange thing; where modern things of life are only a mirage. Many of our books are had and studied by people who have never seen any of Jehovah’s witnesses nor know anything of Jehovah’s advancing organization. Many there are that think that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make Tou Free&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book is the Bible. It is true that this enlightening work is like a match just having been struck in the midst of this black cloud of religious darkness that hovers over the people. Much organization must be met, hundreds of study groups are waiting to be formed; thousands of people must yet be called upon; ministers must have training. There is no time! no time! to let the wheels of the organization stop or be deterred! It must go on. It will go on! It will roll on because Jehovah will make it roll on. The black night of religion is ending; the dawn of the new day is penetrating the darkness; therefore our continued hopes and prayers are that Jehovah strengthen us as a part of his organization in spreading the light of the real Savior in El Salvador.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Good, hard work in Finland brought the brethren many rich blessings. It has been a thrill to all of them to see the work expand even beyond that which they expected. In this cold country to the north we rejoice to see a steady increase in publishers. Last year they gained 14 percent in their ministerial ranks. It was only a few years ago that the Society was on the banned list of the Finnish government. In fact, it is still suppressed by the verdict of the Supreme Court; but while the Society as the servant used by Jehovah’s witnesses was banned, that does not stop Jehovah’s witnesses from preaching the gospel. This they are doing well, and they are pushing forward true worship. The peace treaty made with Finland has provision for freedom of worship, and Jehovah’s witnesses are standing by that freedom, holding to this right to carry on our work. Certainly the good news that the Finnish brethren are taking to the people does the country no harm. There is only one hope for Finland; there is only one hope for the world, and that is the Kingdom for which Christians have been taught to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” That message is bringing real comfort and joy to the hearts of the Finnish people, even into the Arctic circle. The Branch servant tells us of their improvement in organization and of the pleasure that is theirs in serving the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many joyful releases gave their happy contribution to the year. First was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Service Song Book,</span><span class="font6"> released precisely with the same songs and music as in the original English edition. A little later, we got the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People,</span><span class="font6"> which has had a very good reception; and finally the excellent book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font6"> which has been accepted with an unusual enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of Kingdom education has been pushed forcefully forward through circuit activity. Six years ago there were in our country two circuits and two servants to the brethren who went around from company to company serving the brethren. One servant to the brethren traveled in East Finland, and the other one from the South to Lapland. When considering that our country is, as the crow flies, 1,160 kilometers (about 723 miles) long, the servants to the brethren had to make strenuous and troublesome journeys in the regions devastated by war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the great Organizer, Jehovah God, arranged through his service organization a new circuit activity. Our country is now divided into 25 Finnish and 2 Swedish circuits; and 27 servants to the brethren are now able to serve for a whole week’s time even a small company, which, of course, makes the visits far more effective. When the new arrangement began, in January, 1947, we had in this country 299 companies and the peak of publishers was 2,073. Now there are 473 companies, and in July 3,075 publishers were in the field, which is a new all-time high. The addition has been 174 companies and 1,002 publishers in two years! Through circuit assemblies, the new arrangement binds the brethren closer to one another to serve the Lord; and the meetings educate and train the publishers to be more able ministers of the gospel. For instance, one brother was called “mute boy” for many years, but now he is one of the best speakers in that company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swedish assembly was held June 11-13, inclusive, in Helsinki. About 200 brethren were present, of them circa one hundred had to travel more than 1,000 kilometers, because the Swedish-speaking population in Finland is scattered along a very long seashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oulu, the city of the first Finnish assembly, is situated some 170 kilometers (about 106 miles) south from the polar circle, and there the northern brethren assembled June 18-20 to a feast of the brilliant light of the Lord, under the light of the sun, which shines there almost day and night at that time. Our brethren, especially in those regions, are poor and hardly get their meager living; but when they heard about the convention they came hundreds of kilometers, often pathless stretches, from beyond the reach of civilization, to the rich table of the Lord. Some of them could say, “Last night our crop was damaged by the frost,” but they were rich in faith and happy In their devotion to Jehovah, whom they would learn to serve better, leaving everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As these people saw 500 others of the same spirit, faith and purpose assembled they were overjoyed; and when they had tasted the united witness work from door to door and on the streets their zeal had no limits, especially after our new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> was released in Finnish. We had 4,000 copies reserved, and the whole lot was taken as with wings. For instance, one pioneer had 700 of them when he left for the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we still add that 900 persons listened to the public lecture and 43 were immersed we can summarize the results as having proved to be the most blessed in stirring the brethren to more eager activity and determination to advance the extension around the polar circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A week later, June 25-27, was the other Finnish assembly, In Tampere, “Finland’s Manchester,” which had gathered 2,800 brethren on a race course 'where the convention was to be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During these assemblies It was indeed grand and touching to see how whole families, with babies and grandmothers, had come to the convention, just as the fleshly Israel formerly came to the big feasts in Jerusalem. Many were those who enrolled as pioneers, and all decided to be more active in the expansion work. District assemblies proved to be Incomparable helps for the servants to the brethren, pioneers, and company publishers, In deepening the appreciation of our privileges. We think that these assemblies helped us very much to make continuous efforts toward higher aims, so that each of us could make a faithful report to the Lord in vindication of his name. At these assemblies were present, all together, 3,500 brethren and 4,860 at the public meetings, whereas 233 symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to World War II, many of the Lord’s people here in this country have been in great economic difficulties. Hence, the help we have received from the United States, Canada and Sweden has been very valuable and highly appreciated by the brethren, who have in many ways expressed their deeply felt gratitude to our dear Lord, the great Giver of “every good gift and every perfect gift”, and to all those it has pleased him to use to extend the blessings. Certainly it has been a great help for many to go out as pioneers, because else it had been impossible for some to do that. May these few lines be a little expression of our hearty thankfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year has been wonderful with marvelous blessings which our glorious heavenly Father has so richly bestowed upon us and for which we like to praise him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren had to overcome numerous difficulties in the execution and realization of their expansion program in France. They still feel the effects of the war, and the disagreements so manifest in the political parties of France are not helping the economic situation any. There are many restrictions and special laws that affect all the people. However, Jehovah has prepared the way for our brethren to become reorganized, and the work advanced wonderfully during the year. There was a 20-percent increase in number of publishers, and this can be attributed to reorganization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bethel family was moved into a new home which was purchased by the Society so that all of the offices could be in one building. A new warehouse was obtained for storing stock and shipping literature. Due to the government’s recognition of our Society, the companies are now able to get Kingdom Halls and have the privilege of gathering freely to study at regular meetings. The brethren are privileged to go from house to house with the literature and announce </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for the first time in years. Now there are approximately 13,000 readers of this magazine in France. Public lectures are arranged and advertising goes on freely from one end of the country to the other. New fields have opened up, and all of this has caused a great stir in France. The brethren there rejoice in this open field for witnessing, and one can appreciate how glad the Kingdom publishers in France are when reading the year’s report which was submitted by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately at the year’s beginning Jehovah filled our hearts with joy and gratitude. On September 1, 1947, the home secretary again restored our Society in France to a legal footing. Our hard endeavors of long years had now been crowned with success! Our prayers had been answered, and the work was free again! We were able to come out of retirement from the legal point of view and resume our activity in the bright sunlight. The possibility of a great expansion of the work was before us. We saw all these possibilities, but we also had a keen appreciation of our responsibility in making full use of the opportunities in the right manner. Our guiding theme for the year had been received: reorganization, reconstruction and expansion in all features of service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One field of expansion, which we at first believed impossible because of the difficult dwelling and life conditions in our country, started in January, to wit: general pioneer service. In 60 departments out of the 90 forming France there is to be found not one witness of Jehovah; so only pioneer service would bring expansion in the greater part of France. The Lord poured out his rich blessing upon this service and upon all those engaged in it. In January we began with 8 pioneers, who immediately went into great towns, Bordeaux and Toulouse, where they had to start the service wholly alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In February and each succeeding month additional brethren entered the pioneer service. Thus in August we reached the number of 96 pioneers, Including 20 vacation pioneers. Together they form a happy and valiant combat army of witnesses—brothers and sisters, young and old, single and married—all bearing happy witness of their service despite all the difficulties they must overcome. They are working In 49 different towns and are really performing good service for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers have a difficult struggle with the various Protestant sects which originally came from England or Switzerland and took root in France. They are meeting numerous people who got their fill of the Catholic hierarchy and came to these sects looking for another faith. Now they, beginning to realize the truth, rejoice with grateful hearts for having at last found that for which they had been seeking these many years. In one town such a person requested the pioneer brother to come with her to her Baptist church. He complied. At the end of the meeting the woman had some questions for the preacher of the sect, but he could give no answer. Then she requested the brother to answer and, with the help of the Bible, he answered clearly. The preacher fled the room, but the people remaining requested the pioneer to begin a book study with them in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font6"> And so a company of 25 was formed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that we had no servants to the brethren during the year was a deficiency acutely felt. In order to help companies and brethren it is absolutely necessary to commence the activity of servants to the brethren in the different districts. Therefore we called five zealous young pioneer brethren to Bethel, where they were made acquainted with the duties of this service. On October 1, 1948, they will start this activity In companies, and we hope that this help will have good results for the coming year in the expansion of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ten different district assemblies were held in Marseille, Lyon, Paris, Nancy, Nantes, Lille, Thionville, Sarre-guemines, Strasbourg and Mulhouse, providing joy and a rich blessing for all partakers. The brethren learned to esteem more highly their privilege of service, and the result of this was a good increase in number of publishers. Active pioneers made a special contribution to the programs of these assemblies, causing the brethren in general to view the pioneer service in a more favorable light. Many made resolutions during the assemblies to enter the pioneer service, and after the convention in Lille we received 50 applications for this feature of service. The total number of brethren assembled during these conventions was 5,795. More than 9,000 listened to public lectures throughout France. So the assemblies contributed a good part to the work of reorganization and expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clothing and CARE packages the brethren In the United States and Canada sent us were of much help, especially for the pioneers, aiding them to continue in their service. With great joy we wholeheartedly thank all those who contributed toward these gifts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The country known as the Saar formed part of Germany but is now included in French territory. Jehovah’s witnesses living in this land experienced the same things that our German brethren experienced. Many of them lost their houses and property in bombing raids and they suffered terribly in the past years. But despite all this they have come forth rejoicing, knowing that the message must be preached in the Saar; so they are going ahead with courage and zeal in the field service. The Society has been able to supply them with literature, and because of this the brethren have been able to start many studies, and the back-call work is going on very well. The Saar operates under the direction of the Branch office in Paris, and the servant there has this to report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that the publishers are richly equipped with literature, their zeal will be increased even beyond what it was. The brethren will now be able to leave the gospel with the people In printed form for study so that back-calls and book studies can be more easily made. More than 4,000 pieces of literature have been placed with the people. On the average there have been 252 publishers in the field, and in the month of July a new peak of 301 was reached. The hours these brethren have devoted in the field is truly remarkable; they have averaged 19 hours a month for each publisher. No pioneers have been able to engage in the field service as yet, but plans are being made to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year of 1948 has been one of reorganization, and we look forward to 1949 for the Lord’s blessing and greater expansion. We in France and the Saar look to Jehovah with grateful hearts, and we rejoice because of the privileges of service he has granted us. We look to Jehovah and wait upon him for newer and richer blessings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Another very interesting and blessed year has passed for our hard-working brethren in Germany. Jehovah’s witnesses in the eastern and western zones of Germany have proved that great advances in the preaching of the gospel can be made through the same simple manner of proclamation that Jesus introduced 1900 years ago. By going from house to house, making back-calls and conducting Bible studies, Jehovah’s witnesses have brought the truth to thousands upon thousands of persons who have heard and believed. All the German people needed was a preacher, and Jehovah’s witnesses have filled the role as ministers and have preached to that nation the good news. There is still much to be done; and if the preaching must be done without the aid of large quantities of literature, the publishers will continue to do it. It can certainly be said of the ministers in Germany that they are not booksellers. And this can be said of our brethren throughout the whole world, for they are not in this work to sell books; they are in it to comfort those who mourn. Literature is used as an aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our brethren in Germany would rejoice to get literature. What few pieces are available they have loaned out 1,718,504 times. While loaning this literature out they have done much talking and have made back-calls on persons showing interest to the number of 3,227,093 back-calls. Bible studies throughout the land are conducted every week to the number of 13,512. The brethren have not been one whit behind the rest of the world in putting on public meetings, either. The number arranged for and carried through was 14,926. All of this had a great effect on the population of Germany; for in one year’s time we see an 83-percent increase in number of those taking a stand for the truth and becoming servants of God. A new peak of publishers was reached this year, namely, 36,526. Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are really desirous of finding the “other sheep” and assisting them. You can note their determination in this regard from the Branch servant’s very interesting report on the year’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The continuous increase during the previous year made the 10-percent quota inadequate. The number of publishers climbed from month to month, often by as many as 1,000 and once by 2,000. Was it not up to us to observe with all our might the command to preach the gospel in this exceedingly favorable hour for the Kingdom message in our country? So we arranged in August, 1947, at the beginning of the new service year, two model circuit assemblies, one In Magdeburg for the eastern zone and one in Kassel for the three western zones of Germany. Under the direction of the Branch servant and in the presence of all servants to the brethren and almost all company servants, attention was drawn to the remarkably favorable time and the results’ speaking such a plain language. After the audience had heard the appropriate lecture “Go and Disciple All Nations”, with great enthusiasm the resolution was passed: “Every publisher will double himself during the new service year!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Valuable instructions for systematic and steady labor in all features of Kingdom service followed, which made these two service meetings a basis for the activity of all Kingdom publishers in Germany. Today we look back with grateful joy and realize that the Lord approved and blessed our decision made in faith. Even though we did not reach a quota of 100 percent, every regular publisher has actually been doubled. We are well aware of the fact that the extraordinary conditions and tribulations are a factor that gave powerful impetus to our activity. Nevertheless, Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are of the opinion that at no time, not even under normal conditions, should it be difficult for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> publisher of the new world who is doing his work clearsightedly during the long service year, consisting of 12 months of 30 days each, 52 weeks of 7 days each, or a total of 365 days, to gain one new publisher or to double himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great increase in number of publishers and companies has made necessary the establishment of new circuits, and here we have to face another problem. There are 55 organized circuits in Germany, but what we should have is actually 70. We are asking “the Lord of the harvest to send out more laborers”, because, with such an increase, the perceptible lack of capable brothers is to be understood. Therefore our program for the coming year will be devoted to the inner construction of the organization, and we are hoping a number of good and mature brothers will grow up to function as servants in the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During this service year the need in Germany not only prevailed in every respect, but reached its climax, especially in the Eastern zone, where the misery of the people was not surpassed by any attendant phenomenon of the war. Therefore the overwhelming proofs of love from our brethren in America and other lands came just as the saying goes, “When the need is greatest, God’s help is nearest!” It is impossible to imagine the joy and blessings this gift of food in 22,000 CARE parcels, and of clothing in 220 tons (which means not less than a whole trainload of all kinds of garments and shoes for men, women and children), really meant </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">the needy brethren, who for such a long time have endured so many privations. Many touching letters gave evidence of their need, but also of their prayers of thanksgiving to our heavenly Father. The ascending figures in our field service report show clearly—and may this fact bring joy to all brethren and givers in America and other countries— that Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are ready to render their gratitude to Jehovah, the Giver of all good gifts, in the right way, by faithful service and increased endeavors and efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two climaxes of the year were the district assemblies in Kassel and Berlin. Because of the conditions prevailing in this land it was planned to let the brethren of the two Western German districts assemble together. Since the end of the war there exists no hall in Germany that would have room enough for the multitude of publishers; therefore it was decided, in confidence in the Lord, to arrange the two meetings in the open air. A place for the assembly in the West Kassel was chosen, which town can he designated as the most central place in Western Germany. Besides, the administration of the town and the local press have been very obliging. For the other assembly, in the East, we had no other choice than Berlin. For the district assembly in Kassel the last days of July were appointed, and for Berlin the last days of August. In both places the preparations started in good time. In Kassel it was necessary to level a huge meadowy ground, the so-called “Karls-Aue” (Charles-lea), which had many bomb craters, which had to be filled up. For weeks it was pouring with rain. Our pioneers, brothers and sisters, did a marvelous work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the currency reform came and the devaluation of the German money. It started in the West and stopped nearly all business, all economic enterprises in Western Germany. But our nearly half-done preparatory work was continued, and the two district assemblies kept afloat The Lord did wonders. At the very hour of the beginning of the assembly all preparations were completed. Instead of the continuous rain, we had promptly on Friday morning the loveliest sunshine; and Jehovah’s witnesses were having their greatest assembly that ever had taken place in Germany, on the large, magnificent, decorated Karls-Aue, before the highly astounded citizens of Kassel. 16,400 publishers and friends had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When our ushers counted on Sunday afternoon 23,152 persons on the festival ground, and thereafter the newspapers of Kassel, in their friendly and objective reports on the public lecture, “The Coming Gladness for All Mankind,” reported 25-30 thousand attendance, because they counted as well the thousands of people who were standing on the streets leading to the ground and listening with great attention, we knew that this was the largest assembly Jehovah’s witnesses ever had on the European continent. When the friendly chief major, before the lecture began, looked from the speakers’ platform at this vast, festively-moved multitude, he felt he could not refrain from addressing the assembly with some kind words of welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the meantime the political clouds hanging over Berlin became darker and darker. The same maneuver with money had, after the currency reform in the Western zone, in the Eastern zone caused disagreement between the occupying powers, and by far the greatest part of the city, inhabited by millions, came under a hunger blockade. The Soviet Military Administration had denied our request to use the Messehalle in Leipzig for our district assembly, while the beautiful “Waldbuehne” (an open-air theater, surrounded by woods), once built by the Nazis and called “Dietrich Eckart-Buehne”, was offered to us for our free disposal for three days. When the days of the assembly had come, the political tension over Berlin was at its climax. Electricity for light and power was cut off for the Western sectors, and the traffic of the huge city was Interrupted. The food supply of the two million people by means of the “airbridge” had to be done under increasing difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There the second miracle of the Lord happened. Again the bad weather, which had prevailed until Thursday evening, had to give way to allow the opening of the district assembly for Eastern Germany on Friday morning. 16,265 people from all parts of Eastern Germany had dug their way through all obstacles and adversities of political, economic and (with regard to the traffic) technical kind, to assemble in Berlin, and to produce a document of real peace amidst the political pell-mell. With empty stomachs but with eyes shining with joy, the brethren were sitting In the huge open-air theater, a little dale that has been transformed and constructed by master hands to an amphitheater of unparalleled beauty. The large pictorial backdrop painted by artists, similar to the one in Kassel, which showed the bright-shining Mount Zion, spanned over by a rainbow and flanked by scriptures in large letters, was fixed with the upper edge slightly leaning backward, thus beaming unto the uppermost seats and offering a most attractive sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The program, exactly the same as In Kassel and carefully arranged according to the pattern given by the headquarters of the Society, kindled great enthusiasm with Its many helpful instructions. On Sunday afternoon, during the public talk, around 26,000 people filled the theater. That means that about 10,000 people of Berlin, in spite of the difficult traffic conditions, made the long train ride to the “Waldbuehne”, to hear the lecture and to visit Jehovah’s witnesses at the celebration of their festivity. How strengthening and encouraging these two festivals have been for the partakers is to be seen from the field service report of the month of August, that has just been compiled. It shows an Increase of 2,785 publishers for this one month, and the report is not even complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Interesting and worthy to be noticed that the difference of the two “democracies”, the Western and the Eastern, the political contrasts of which continuously cause frictions and tensions in Germany and between her inhabitants, and which hurtfully influence the economy, the commerce and the communications, could in no wise cause any separation or Interruption of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the German brethren heard about the hard persecutions of their fellow servants In Greece, they considered it their privilege to ‘fight for their brethren’. (Neh. 4:14) Hundreds of letters of protest have been written by the friends of all four zones to the leading men in the Greek government in favor of our persecuted brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just at the time when the four printing machines were set up in our new building in Wiesbaden, the first shipment of paper arrived (a gift from the Brooklyn headquarters to the work in Germany). Since just during these days came essential alleviations and clearances with respect to the regulations about the production of printed matter, we are in the joyful expectation that in the coming service year we shall be able to print more copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and of booklets, yes, maybe even books, and therewith minimize the lack of literature in the country and give the brethren in their blessed service of proclaiming the message of the truth the appropriate assistance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The millions of persons living in modern cities or in countries where communications and transportation and life in general are abreast of the latest developments can hardly make their minds jump the wide span between the way of life in modern civilization and the way of life in Africa. Although progress has been made in communications and transport between the more important towns, beyond these places is the jungle, the bush, the primitive life of the people with no professional men, and where all the inhabitants use the sun as their alarm clock. It is into such territory that the truth has gone. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Gold Coast are desirous of vindicating Jehovah's name, and they do appreciate the statement of the apostle Peter at Acts 10:34, 35, wherein he said, “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.” Due to the splendid work being carried on in the Gold Coast, a new Branch was opened at Accra during the year, and the Lord’s blessing has been upon this arrangement, for the work has increased in number of publishers by 104 percent. The Branch servant gives us some heartcheering news from this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The opening of the past service year saw Jehovah’s witnesses busily engaged in the circulating of a petition, protesting against the unjust restrictions on the importation of the Society’s literature. Several brethren were assigned to visit remote districts, and the two Gilead graduates of the eighth class made a 1,500-mile tour encircling the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many were the experiences of the Gilead ministers, being white brethren. In Kumasi, the capital of Ashanti, they visited the lorry<sup>7</sup> park together with two native brethren as Interpreters. Soon they were surrounded by two hundred natives, and the work of explaining their mission began. As each one signed others came up to gain information; and in one and a half hours 200 signatures had been obtained. Some of those who signed enthusiastically explained the purpose to others. The next day the party of four went by train (the third-class compartment resembled a poultry farm) to Abuasi, a gold-mining area. They walked through the main street to the end of the village and then began working their way back. It was not long before the signatures were forthcoming. But, instead of the signers carrying on with their daily duties they followed the brethren and the crowd increased as the party made their way back to catch the return train. Several signed on the station platform; and even when the brethren got into the train the petition sheet was handed through the window for more signatures. A cheer went up as the party left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing demonstrates that the people in this British colony want to read and learn more about the Bible. It can be said that literally thousands want to read the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font6"> Several mass protest meetings were also held with good results. A total of 10,496 signatures were obtained in six weeks. The African press were kind to us and carried regular reports as the number of signatures mounted. The letters of protest sent by brethren from other countries to the governor also played a big part in bringing the matter forcefully to his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did they lift the restrictions? No! An import license was granted to import Bibles, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot; </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers;</span><span class="font6"> but other recent publications were still classified as “seditious”, “defamatory,” “scandalous” or “demoralizing”. Imagine the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> being classified under any of the foregoing headings! True to its tradition, a conspiracy of several religions is responsible with the Roman Catholic brand taking the leading role. “.. . light has come into the world, and yet, because their actions were wicked, men have loved the darkness more than the light.”—John 3:19-21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately following the work of petition, arrangements for the forthcoming visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel in December came to the fore. All the brethren keenly looked forward to this event. This national assembly was held at the capital, Accra. The people of Accra knew that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town: Four hundred placards were posted up and several thousand handbills distributed advertising the lecture “Permanent Governor of All Nations”. The public meeting given in three languages brought an attendance of 1,383.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The discourses given by Brothers Knorr and Henschel were greatly appreciated by all On Sunday morning 171 brethren were immersed. As the day sped on many expressed that the assembly was drawing to a close too soon. However, on Sunday evening Brother Knorr announced that a Branch office would operate in the Gold Coast from January 1, and upon hearing this news the brethren were overjoyed, and showed it with prolonged applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great increase as shown in the annual report bespeaks Jehovah’s approval and blessing on the above arrangement: From 575 publishers for the last service year to 1,134; from 24 companies to 42 organized companies; and from 6 pioneers to 31 pioneers. Several companies have reached the quota of 10 percent of the publishers as pioneers, and we hope to soon reach the quota for the country. The Accra company with 114 publishers have produced 12 pioneers, some of whom are now serving in remote parts of the Gold Coast and British Mandated Togoland, doing good work. Some of the pioneers are putting in 175 hours each month and have expressed the desire to go to Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The case of the restrictions on the importation of the Society’s publications continued to be pressed. An interview with the new governor of the Gold Coast, who took up his duties in January, was requested and granted. The interview took place on May 14, and the contents of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, “The Kingdom Is at Hand”, “Let God Be True”, The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> were discussed, and a copy of each left with the governor. He promised to review the matter in the light of what was said. As this report is being typed out the following communication was received: “I have the honor to inform you that it has been decided that the following ‘Watch Tower’ publications are not to be regarded as prohibited imports:— ‘Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,’ ‘Peace—Can It Last?’ ‘Let God Be True’, ‘One World, One Government’.” We feel confident, as the restrictions on these publications are lifted, that it will only be a matter of form before the other publications will also be granted importation. To Jehovah we give the praise for this victory, which will result in greater expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An outstanding obstacle w’hich each publisher has to contend with in the field service is the African’s belief in the afterlife. Can there be a people in any part of the earth who believe more in the immortality of the soul and the spiritual world than the Gold Coastian? Every conceivable angle on the subject they think up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time was drawing near for the district assembly which was due to be held on August 6-8 in Kumasi. The Prempeh Assembly Hall and grounds were booked for the three days. This is one of the most suitable places in the country at which to hold an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eight hundred brethren were in attendance. Each feature of Kingdom service was discussed. One of the hlgh-lights of the assembly came when the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> was released amidst great applause. This was the first new release since the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> book. The fact that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Joy</span><span class="font6"> booklet was also being printed in Twi greatly encouraged the brethren. As each pioneer filed by the speaker on the platform to receive his free copy applause after applause broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public meeting was a great success, with an attendance of 2,500. The talk “The Coming Gladness for All Mankind” discussed much about the spiritual realm, the obedient angels, and Satan and his demons. This really caught on with the native, because of his strong belief in the spiritual world. The talk closed at 7: 30 p.m., but the public were discussing the subject with the brethren out in the grounds up until 11 p.m. That was not long enough. The next morning some came to the hall with further questions, and it was the general topic in town on the Monday. The district assembly proved to be one of the most instructive and joyful assemblies ever held in this country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The political and social life in the land of Greece is certainly in an upheaval. There are two political factions striving for power, and for two years now they have been fighting each other fiercely while the common people suffer. Notwithstanding, the Kingdom message continues to go forward, and we find a 23-per-cent increase in number of publishers. This is really remarkable when one considers that the Greek Orthodox Church on the one hand is trying to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. On the other hand the people of this country that claims to be for freedom of worship are oppressed by their own rulers, as well as by the armies opposing the government in power. These latter forces come into small cities and towns, burning and destroying them and driving out Jehovah’s witnesses with the rest of the people. Odd as it may seem, the United States is spending millions of dollars to help the present Greek government, but the Greek government deports American citizens who are in that country trying to do ministerial work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some time ago two graduates from Gilead were sent to Greece to help organize the work of the ministers there. They did splendidly while they were allowed to stay. The officials thought that by removing these two Americans the work would subside. They succeeded in getting the two brethren out of the country in November, 1947, but neither the Greek Orthodox Church nor the government has succeeded in stopping the work. The Branch servant’s report is very enlightening as to what is going on in that country at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Subsequent to the compulsory departure of the Gilead brethren, a period of intensive persecution followed, and was accompanied by a campaign of defamatory propaganda against Jehovah’s witnesses. A systematic slandering of the faith and work of Jehovah’s witnesses was carried out in the churches and schools of catechism of the Greek Orthodox religion. Hundreds of thousands of tracts and booklets were printed and distributed free of charge throughout the country warning of the danger from the outspread of this “defiling heresy” of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is noticeable that all this intolerant and malicious campaign against the Lord’s servants had as a pivotal point the purpose of defaming Jehovah’s witnesses, not merely as holding to Christian convictions different from those of the prevailing religion, but chiefly as being enemies of the state, anarchists, and generally as following a “disguised foreign-religion pursuit for political world-domination”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consequences of this malignant campaign had a greater effect in the provinces and especially in the districts where war operations were carried out on the anarchist elements. The various religious circles in the divers places tried to exploit such atmosphere and use certain military agents to accomplish their intolerant objectives and mistreat Christian witnesses of Jehovah. In certain instances they even succeeded in having decisions issued for exiling the brethren. It was only through the immediate and strong action of this Branch with the minister of public order that these conspirators’ plans were defeated, and the brethren were not exiled or, if already exiled, they returned by virtue of an order issued by the minister himself who, be it mentioned by the way, showed sufficient understanding, at least personally, in the cases put before him. In spite, however, of the liberal and good intention which the minister seems to have personally, the various agents in the provinces are acting according to the clergy’s instigations, and do not hesitate to declare even publicly that they give no consideration to ministers or anyone else and will do whatever they like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would require scores of pages to report all the cases of violence against the Lord’s servants. Indicatively, I would report the case of five brethren from Grevena, Western Macedonia. The military police of the town posted placards at the brethren’s shops with the inscription, “Out of bounds to all ranks.” The metropolitan of Grevena excommunicated the brethren by special encyclical and forbade the citizens, under penalty of excommunication, to go and market at the brethren’s shops, or even merely to salute them! Moreover, the Committee of Public Security decided to exile the brethren for one year. Among the brethren there was a 77-year-old man, and another of 67; these have been exiled to the island Lemnos, as being “dangerous of escaping”. Almost every day, the local Branch of the Society is receiving reports from various companies regarding seizures and burning of our literature publicly, dissolution of meetings, illegal detention in police sections, beatings of men and women and generally various acts of violence against people whose only offense is their desire to worship Jehovah “in spirit and in truth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ununderstandable is the refusal of the Greek post offices to accept to carry our literature in case they are not sealed with the wording; “Heresy of Bible Students,” or “Heresy of Jehovah’s Witnesses”! Even our correspondence itself is frequently stamped by certain agents of the postal administration on the outside of the envelopes with the defamatory phrases: “Heresy of Ohiliastai,” or “Suspicious; contains Ohiliastic printed matter,—Attention of Police”, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year, according to the reports received at the office, about 600 brethren were arrested and referred to courts. Of these, 232 were sentenced to penalties of from one month to one year, to very heavy fines and police parole. It is estimated that all these court cases cost the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses about $6,000, without taking into account the other losses resulting from the imprisonment of brethren, etc. The Devil is also waging an economic warfare to exhaust the Lord’s people, but he will equally be defeated on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A considerable contribution to the expansion work was effected through the systematized form of the work of servants to the brethren. In spite of the abnormal conditions and the difficulties in the communications, and also in spite of the dangers due to the war operations in progress, the servants to the brethren became successful in bringing their mission to a favorable issue. A servant to the brethren visited a company, and, after finishing his mission, he prepared to leave next morning. In the night, however, an inroad of insurgents took place; these entered the town, set several buildings afire, took away foodstuffs, and abducted a great many inhabitants. None of the brethren suffered anything. By the Lord’s grace, the said brother left in the morning and continued his tour. That way, and under such peculiar circumstances, the work of the servants to the brethren is performed according to the Theocratic spirit of the Lord’s organization, and efforts are being made to convey such spirit to practically all the companies so as to assist God’s people in advancing in a better organized condition to do the work of preaching the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Interest of the organization in helping the brethren in Greece was climaxed by the dispatch of a ten-page densely typewritten letter from the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to the Greek premier, Mr. Th. So-phoulis, and to other Greek officials, along with the article of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine of April 8, 1948, on Greece. Another letter of the president, with copy of the letter to Sophoulis and the article of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine was sent to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">local American officials of the American Mission for Aid to Greece, as well as to the American Embassy here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, through this drastic action of the Society, the question of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece has been brought before the government factors, and became the object of a search and investigation to an unprecedented extent. The government’s interest in having our case investigated and studied became intensified by the thousands of letters sent up by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> readers to the Greek legations abroad and also to the president of the Greek government and the various ministers direct. From the Philippine islands, Indies, Australia, North and South America, and the world at large, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> readers have considerably contributed to calling the Greek government’s attention to the unjust anachronistic and cruel treatment of Christian Jehovah’s witnesses in the supposedly democratic country of Greece. We do not yet know what will finally be the Greek government’s attitude toward our case which is brought before them in such a strong way. But whatever the Greek government’s attitude may be, this letter-campaign and more especially the president’s letters to the Greek officials were a tremendous and unprecedented witness concerning the faith and work of Jehovah’s witnesses. True, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> article on Greece with the rigorous and burning statement of the actual facts, irritated them to an inconceivable extent. It seems, however, that this was the only way for them to awake from their lethargy and closely investigate to learn who Jehovah’s wit-nesess are, and not let themselves suffer the Influence of fanatic religious circles and do or tolerate actions reproaching the so-called cradle of civilization and democracy. With petitions and personal calls on the Greek officials, the local Branch makes every lawful effort toward having the competent Greek authorities consider the case of Jehovah’s witnesses in a just and right way. We look for a safeguarding of some essential human rights: freedom of worship, freedom of importation and distribution of our literature, and stoppage of the anachronistic and medieval persecution. Any purposeful attempt made by the truth’s enemies to correlate or merely compare our activity and work with those of any political systems and movements and especially with the theories and practices of the ungodly communistic elements is utterly unacceptable by us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Irrespective, however, of the course to be taken by the Greek government, one fact is indisputable: Jehovah’s witnesses will continue w’ith unity and sound belief the work of reconstructing Jehovah's worship even in this land, helping good-will people to learn of the only way leading to salvation and life. Whether they allow us or not, whether we have books or not, whether the persecutions cease or continue still more severe, we shall continue singing Jehovah’s praises together with all our fellow ministers in the different parts of the world; we shall continue with unabated zeal and Theocratic spirit to push on the expansion work, enduring until Jehovah fully vindicates his name and clears up the earth of the malignant, infectious parasites of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>ALBANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Branch office in Athens, Greece, continually tries to keep in touch with the few brethren in Albania and to supply them with the necessary food to keep them alive spiritually. This small country has been enclosed in an iron curtain, and it is practically impossible to get communications in or out of Albania. The servant to the brethren who recently visited the district in the neighborhood of Albania gathered some information and was told that there are about 35 of Jehovah’s witnesses still living in Albania, gathered in various towns and villages, and that to the best of their ability they are promoting Jehovah’s true worship. They are maintaining their integrity. The brethren within Albania have protested to the government, asking for greater freedom to preach, but with no effect. The Albanian government has officially prohibited the witness work, even going so far as to refuse the brethren permission to meet. All literature sent into Albania is seized by the government and destroyed. Despite this severe persecution Jehovah’s witnesses there are still talking the good news, and we can feel certain that Jehovah will bless and protect them and give them grace in their time of need.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are twelve regular publishers proclaiming the message of the Kingdom in Turkey. Good progress has been made, when we compare it with the former year. The government still has certain prohibitions against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, but, nevertheless, the brethren there have made praiseworthy efforts to overcome all obstacles so as to advance the work in this Mohammedan country. Reports are now coming regularly to the Athens office from our brethren in Turkey, and the Branch servant gives us a little information as to what is going on there at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is only one company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Istanbul, numbering over 30 brethren. As there are not yet books in the modern Turkish language with Latin characters, the witness work is confined to a verbal witness to the Mohammedans. Regarding the other nationalities, such as Greeks, Armenians, Jews, French, etc., enough of whom are living in that city, the message is given by means of our literature available in all these languages. Company meetings are regularly held, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> is studied in the service meetings, to the great joy and strengthening of the brethren. From the service reports it is seen that a steady progress is achieved by that company. During the month of August there was a peak of 23 publishers, which Is far in excess of that of any previous month. It is particularly satisfactory to note that the company servant there Is also enrolled as a pioneer and has been working as such since March, 1948, having recorded a monthly average of 188 hours and 62 back-calls. It is further reported that four new brethren symbolized their consecration by water immersion; two of them are Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The company servant writes that the brethren succeeded in finding a suitable dwelling, wherein to hold their meetings henceforth. So, the company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Istanbul will be having their own Kingdom Hall. A few months ago, when they received the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> article on Greece, they handed it over to the metropolitans in the patriarchate. Thus, the severe reproof of the Lord’s organization for the medieval methods used by the Greek Orthodox clergy against Christian witnesses of Jehovah reached within the portals of Orthodoxy’s “Vatican”. Our brethren there are full of zeal and rejoice in bringing the message to the international public living in that populous city. As a matter of fact, they “are singing Jehovah’s praises among the nations”. There is every reason to expect that the advancement noticed in the witness work will continue, so that the work of expanding Jehovah’s true worship may continue also in that country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A group of 20 graduates from Gilead have accomplished much in the country of Guatemala. In the past year alone we see an increase of 61 percent in number of publishers associated with Jehovah’s witnesses. Work is done not only in the principal city, but during the year the Branch servant also had the opportunity of working in Puerto Barrios, on the east coast of Guatemala. Much interest was found there among the 15,000 inhabitants, but publishers will have to be established in that city in order to organize a company. In but three weeks’ time 450 books and booklets were placed, as well as several hundred magazines. There are other such towns and villages in Guatemala that need attention, and it is hoped that during this year many of these people will be reached. A very interesting report comes from the Branch servant. He gives us a good idea of how the work is carried on and what joy the brethren have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Turning in the annual report is like summing up another blessed paragraph in the record of Jehovah’s ministers in this land ; a written, permanent account of the proof of their ministry measured according to their blameless pattern, Christ Jesus. Last year we ended with a peak of 112, this year with 185; showing that the Gilead ministers, general pioneers and company publishers have led many new ones out into the fearless, open worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of interest is the never-to-be-forgotten visit of two Gilead missionaries who served a small company about thirty miles from the Mexican border. Many there have hearing ears, as manifested by their account. These brethren lived far out in the country, with very few houses near them. The house stood in a little clearing that had been hacked out of the coffee and banana trees. Although there were only two publishers in the company and very few people seemed to live in this wild country, 75 came the first night of the visit to hear the talk and to ask questions. Two days later a trip on horseback was made and a talk given to 40 who had not been able to come to the first group. These sincere people showed great appreciation for the truths the Lord was bringing them, entire families walking several miles at night without any kind of light, to hear the talk. The last night 100 were present to hear the talk “Paradise Earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some begin publishing very soon after they begin studying, and then some of them soon fall out. However, there are some who, having proved or tested the spirit of our work and found it to be true, really desire to progress to maturity in the Lord. An example of this is related by another Gilead graduate: “Ten months ago, returning home after an afternoon of studies in a section of government houses, a man came up to me and wanted to know if I would come by to help him study as I did for his fellow member of the National Band. The family studied diligently and, after hearing the announcements at a company meeting, wanted to open their home for a company book study. Soon all of the members of the family became publishers, and some have many studies of their own. Although the brother has a large family to support, he says he is finding so many people of good-will that, in order to make sure that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font6"> get called on, he will have to arrange his affairs and become a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our service year seemed to get off to a slow start, and for six months we did not have a new peak. The increased Memorial activity then started us off with a peak of 118. In May the Society sent a servant to the brethren to visit the Central American Branches, including Guatemala. He served the two units in the capital as well as our assembly. The benefits of all this concentrated mutual support greatly animated the publishers to a new peak of 152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another old pioneer sister, who has been contending for the faith for many years out in the wilds of the steaming jungles southwest of the city, has sent in many good experiences. Among them is this one she writes: “ ‘God’s Ministers’ Testimony Period has closed, and it appears to leave a streak of light in my territory. There are some people that I have been talking to about God’s kingdom for quite a long time. But they could never see or understand; always they would tell me what some preacher said. Now in this Period they told me that what I say Is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mas honita</span><span class="font6"> [more beautiful] than what the preachers say.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">None of the publishers in Guatemala have much of this world’s goods but they appreciate the Kingdom message and have therefore given their time and what they could to advance its proclamation. Through a simple, nonsectarian study of God’s Word and a consecration to him they have become real ministers of the gospel. Thus during the past year many persons of good-will have found real friends in Jehovah God and his reigning King, Christ Jesus. By God’s grace, they will as his servants press on to a perfection of their ministry.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For some time a number of graduates from Gilead have worked diligently to proclaim the message of the Kingdom in Haiti. At first it seemed to be quite a struggle to find interest, but by patience and endurance the Lord has rewarded their efforts. This year we find an increase of 125 percent in number of publishers preaching the gospel in Haiti, and some very good experiences are related by the Branch servant. We will let him tell them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The preaching of the Kingdom gospel has made more progress during the past service year in Haiti in spite of the backwardness and illiteracy of its people. Two companies were organized and now we list three companies under this Branch. One of these was established 100 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince. This was done by accepting the invitation of some very poor people of good-will to come and witness among them. This we did, and gave them several public lectures in Creole. At one of these 233 persons attended. Many of these persons had read some of the Society’s older publications and then separated themselves from their churches, at the same time hoping that someday Jehovah’s witnesses would start the work in their part of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These kind people were so glad to see the Lord’s servants for the first time that several of them spent the day witnessing with us in this small village of thatched huts. At the same time we announced a public talk to be given that very evening. It was well attended by over two hundred people that gathered in the public square. It made a striking picture, for it was delivered by oil lamp, this place being one of the towns without electricity. (Only four towns besides the capital are electrified in Haiti.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the newly arrived Canadian Gilead graduates had the following experience: “While working my territory in Port-au-Prince I met a Mr. R—, who showed interest in the message. He accepted the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘La Verite Yous Affranchira’ (‘Truth’</span><span class="font6"> book in French) and seemed to be very much pleased in getting it. Arrangements were made to return after three weeks, as he was about to leave on a vacation. On the first return visit he mentioned reading a portion of the book and found it very interesting. It was observed he had marked portions of the book, and on those portions he posed questions. A very interesting time was had and he enjoyed the answers to his questions, especially on the teachings of Catholicism, as he had been a Catholic and once closely associated with the priesthood. When setting a date to return again he said: ‘A friend of mine is interested in this and would like to talk to you; would it be all right if I invited him for the next time?’ I replied, ‘Most certainly.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The next time I was introduced to a secondary-school teacher from a town about 100 miles away. He had many questions on the subjects of immortality, trinity, etc. He too was pleased to accept </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘La Verite Voug Affranchira’</span><span class="font6">. Mr. R— said: ‘I know another man who is interested and wants to come the next time.’ I said, ‘Very well.’ That week there were three persons at the study and another book placed. The study being over, Mr. R— had the same statement to make of another party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This time I was introduced to a writer for one of the newspapers here in the city. He too accepted the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth' </span><span class="font6">book in French. He pointed to the first chapter of the book, concerning Christendom, and said: ‘I am going to publish this in our newspaper.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That week there appeared in their newspaper nearly a complete chapter quoted word for word from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’ </span><span class="font6">book. Later it was learned that the priests from across the street sent a servant over to buy up about 35 copies of that same newspaper. The next issue appeared with another portion quoted from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font6"> book, closing with the names of Mr. R— and the writer, to be consulted by anyone desiring copies of the book. They have much more material prepared from the French </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font6"> book to be published from time to time. In the meantime, Mr. R— has taken me to other interested parties, resulting in five new book studies, and he is now himself a ‘proclamateur’ (publisher) ! All this within two months!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In the beautiful islands of Hawaii Jehovah’s witnesses continue to press on, proclaiming the good news. The brethren here have the same spirit of expansion as do their fellow workers in all parts of the earth. From time to time they travel to different islands in the Hawaiian group to put on public meetings, arrange for circuit assemblies and do everything possible to teach the inhabitants of the islands the Kingdom message. During the year, 58 individuals symbolized their consecration by water baptism. Publishers have increased in number by 20 percent over last year, while back-calls, book studies and public meetings are all on the increase. The Branch servant gives us a brief report on what is happening there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in the islands has been greatly helped with the coming of two Gilead graduates in September, 1947, and two more in July, 1948. As a result a new peak of 183 publishers has been reached. Seven pioneers were privileged to be called to Gilead in February with prospects of going to Japan thereafter. This lowered the number of pioneers for a while, but soon other publishers entered the pioneer service and took their place. However, many more pioneers are needed to assist several groups of isolated publishers to form more companies. There are now seven companies in the islands. The Honolulu company has reached a new peak in hours, reporting an average of 27.9 for 75 publishers for August. All company publishers averaged 20 hours for August, which is the best since July, 1947, when they averaged 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During a trip to the large island of Hawaii on the west side called Kona, the servant to the brethren was accompanied by a Korean brother who gave an hour talk in the Korean church at Holualoa. As a result the whole congregation, including the preacher, came to the local Kingdom Hall every evening for Bible studies. Another Korean preacher who was a Baptist was given a good witness by this Korean brother and both of these preachers as well as several others were immersed at the beach. Now they are rejoicing in bringing the Kingdom message to other persons of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to the increased activity on the part of all the publishers some of them have been challenged to public debates by some of the “Christian” religions, but when the time came for the discussion the religionists never showed up. Public meetings were held in their territory, giving the people an opportunity to hear the truth in contrast with their religion based on human traditions. These have been well attended, and In Manoa valley, where some publishers were challenged, the attendance averaged 70 to 80 for the series of lectures. Even In the isolated desert section of Waianae, on Oahu, where there is a small company, the Honolulu company assisted by furnishing speakers and some publishers, which brought a peak of 65 attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One sister associated with the Waimea company had an interesting experience while she was in a hospital because of an injured leg. The Catholic priest came into her room while she was reading the Bible and asked what good she could get from reading it. She was surprised at his attitude, as she supposed a priest, who pretends to be a servant of God, should encourage a person to read and understand the Bible. After asking him several questions on leading doctrines taught in the Scriptures she found that he knew very little about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest also told her that she had no right to use the name Jehovah, as he was not God, but that Jesus Christ was given all power in heaven and earth and he was God. However, she gave a good witness to the honor of the true God, Jehovah, which caused quite a commotion in the hospital. The nurses came in, wanting to know what was going on and who was convincing whom. Also several friends came to see her while the priest was still there, so she ignored the priest and gave a further witness to her friends, some of whom were from her former church and many of whom have since left the church. Now some leaders of this church are inviting the witnesses to discuss the Bible with them in studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Translation work on the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’</span><span class="font6"> in the Hawaiian language is completed and ready to be sent to Brooklyn for printing. Many Hawaiians have been asking about a study book in their language, and they are looking forward to Bible studies soon. Many orders are already on hand for delivery as soon as it arrives. The same book is also being translated into the Japanese language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After noting the activity for the year and seeing how Jehovah has led his people and provided everything needful at the proper time in the way of spiritual food as well as material things, we are indeed grateful and pray that his blessings will continue and a greater increase will come, all to the honor of His great name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The grand and pleasant message that Jehovah reigns is reaching every nation and gradually will reach every part of every nation. While the old world prepares and arms itself to handle the perplexing problems of the future, Jehovah’s witnesses march quietly on, preaching the good news of the new world. The good news is spreading to all parts of Honduras, and in just a few short years the “other sheep” have been gathered to the number of 278, a new peak for the 1948 service year. In fact, the average number of publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom has increased by 164 percent over that of the previous year. It is easy to see the reason why there has been such a tremendous increase in the work in Honduras when one reads the year’s report from the Branch servant. Jehovah’s witnesses in Honduras are having a joyful time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With expansion as the “watchword” the work was carried to the isles of the sea located forty miles off the north coast of the mainland. The largest island of the three, Roa-tan, is inhabited by about 4,000 of the colored English-speaking race. Early in the year, the servant to the brethren with Brother and Sister White called at the capital, Coxen Hole. It was a chilly, all-night trip lying out on the open deck of the combination motor launch and sailboat before we arrived in the pretty harbor early the following morning. After getting settled in the village pension or boarding house we spread out to cover the territory as quickly as possible. We found that the majority of the dwelling-places of these friendly, smiling folk were stretched out for miles along the palm-dotted, white sandy beach. Many of these were nothing more than wooden frames with thatched roofs, built out over the water on stilts, making It necessary to walk long, narrow “catwalks” to get to them. Books were eagerly accepted, as these people are more or less tied to their little island, and when they are through taking care of their cocoanut crops they have lots of time for reading and talking, which they love to do. It was a pleasant surprise to find old books and new ones in several homes sent by friends in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These preparatory visits are necessary for expansion. These are first-time contacts with the truth for most of the people In this country. As we are not able to call back too often at such isolated points as Roatan, the first real taste for the good-will comes from their personal study of the books. We know there are always those few who really dig in and search out the truth with the help of the Lord’s directing spirit. We found several suchlike ones in Coxen Hole, and we hope to be able to organize them into a working company to take care of the Interest there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Returning to visit the La Lima company the servant to the brethren found the brethren pushing steadily ahead. Up until then only the English colored company was operating, taking care of as much of the native Spanish good-will as was possible. However, it was growing too fast for them. What was needed was a Spanish unit. But here arose one of the prevailing problems in Honduras: that of finding among the publishers those that were properly married and hence qualified to hold positions of responsibility as servants in the company organization. Under the Influence of the Roman Catholic rule a very large part of the native population have never married in accord with the law of the land. They just don’t see why they should. A couple decides to live together, so they call in their children they may have had from several previous companions and settle down to raise more. The daily newspapers recognize the illegitimate births right alongside the legitimate ones in their daily listings. It is not an unusual thing for children to be given away for someone else to raise, and many are the ones who don’t know who their father or mother is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the condition in which the truth finds many of those who are now publishers for the Kingdom. In this case, the most capable and zealous publisher and her newly interested companion had been living together for a number of years without being properly married. What were they to do? Why, do just what the Bible says: clean up, get married! So that’s what they did. This unusual event caused quite a comment among the neighbors and friends and was a good witness to others in like condition. When things were in order the Spanish unit was organized. Three months later the one company, now working as two units, had jumped from 24 publishers to 77.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two miles out from La Lima, in one of the banana work camps, an isolated person of good-will requested a visit. It had to be at night because of his working hours. Striking out along the pitch-dark bush trail the servant to the brethren arrived to find, not just the one person ready for his back-call, but twenty-three eager persons of good-will expectantly seated in the lamplight out in the cool of the evening in front of the house. This called for more than a short back-call discussion; so an hour public lecture was given on the subject “The Bible Against Religion”. In the middle of the talk we were interrupted by a chanting group of candle-bearing natives that approached to within twenty feet of us, where they stopped in front of a palm-covered, crude, wooden cross. For five minutes they bowed down crossing themselves, mumbling prayers, putting flowers around the cross, kissing and worshiping it. This, it turned out, was holy cross day for the Roman Catholics and they were stopping in front of all crosses put up at intervals around the camp to worship them. We gathered that this late visit to this particular spot was for our benefit. What a contrast it was! Here, out in the jungle wilds just a few feet from each other, were two groups of natives, the one practicing demon paganism as their ancestors had done centuries previous; the other group hearing, many for the first time, about Jehovah God and his New World of righteousness. It was a good illustrative example to the audience of the difference between the true worship and demon religion. Quite a few of the twenty-three that heard the talk that night are now themselves publishers of good news in that little camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another new company was formed during the year to bring the total up to 5 for the country. One of our Tegucigalpa publishers sent his mother-in-law some literature. Through subsequent contacts she became an isolated publisher in the little mountain village of San Antonio de Flores. In August the Branch servant and Brother and Sister Bourne made a visit to see her and aid there in the service work. Traveling in grand style In the back of a truck bouncing around on large sacks of frijoles, we arrived well done under the hot, blazing, tropical sun. That night a talk was given to an attentive audience of 15, the discourse being interrupted only once by the family pig, trailed by four squealing piglets, making a dash for the front door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following day two public talks were scheduled to be given. The only shady spot in the village was under a nice tree In the front yard of the Catholic church, so we selected that spot to give the talks. Practically the whole population attended, including the evangelists and their pastor. By the last talk the pastor’s face was deepening into a scowl. It was clear he was feeling the blows of truth that knocked down the walls of lies about him. After the talk he invited Brother Bourne over for the next morning for a discussion. Thinking he meant a personal visit for himself, Brother and Sister Bourne called at his home. He was waiting with about 10 of his flock looking like a bulldog ready for a fight. But his balloon was soon pricked. He got stuck trying to prove the “trinity” doctrine. Right in front of all his flock he finally admitted he didn’t really believe In the “trinity”. Then, why did he teach it I Well, that was all there was for that day. He had an appointment somewhere else and had to leave. Walt until he tries to teach that again to his flock if he has any. All that day people came to the newly organized, adobe, Saldn del Reino (Kingdom Hall) to learn more about the New World. News of the new earth and the Kingdom blessings to the good-will, captive-bound evangelists in this country is like a big juicy bone to a starved dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first district assembly was held in Tegucigalpa. The Palace theater was obtained for the main talk. Extensive advertising had been carried on using twenty thousand handbills, store-window placards, personal letters and programs for back-call names, and spot radio announcements inviting the public to hear the discourse “Permanent Governor of All Nations”. Would they come? They did, to the number of 467, the highest attendance of good-will listeners to any public lecture given thus far in Tegucigalpa. One businessman expressed himself as follows: “It’s about time someone came out with a message like that. It’s new to me but I like itI” Old and new interest alike were aroused by the talk and local meeting attendance began picking up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There lias been no opposition during the year to any feature or part of the service. It is our hope to continue to expand to all parts of Honduras and push the restoration work to all who ‘sigh and cry’. It is a joyful privilege to write that we are contented in our assignment. Certainly we have our problems, sicknesses, different living conditions than we were sometimes used to, but so do our brethren elsewhere. The apostle Paul said, “Be ye imitators of me.” If he was sick as a pioneer missionary once in a while, so are we; if he had problems in the service, so do we; if he had a big responsibility in caring for congregations, we have too; if he was blessed in his service, so are we; If he was faithful and contented, so we will be until the Sender of good news says it is done. We look forward to a greater year of expansion than ever for 1949.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Another service year rich in experience has drawn to a close for our brethren in Hungary. Here, too, they see the need to ‘enlarge the place of their tent’ so as to embrace more and more of the people of goodwill. The ruling element of this country has been influenced for centuries by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which has always stood in the way of education and real progress. Especially have they endeavored to withhold from the people a knowledge of God’s Word. Despite the efforts put forth by the clergy to keep the people in darkness, the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses have swelled continuously, and more praise year by year ascends to the heavenly Father. Each year there has been a steady increase, until now there are 1,346 publishers singing the new song, which indicates an advance of 36 percent in number of ministers. The Branch servant has sent in some very interesting experiences, showing clearly the kind of opposition they must put up with, but at the same time he relates the joy of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The population of the country is predominantly Catholic and so the attacks against us are principally from the Roman Catholic clergy. The western part of Hungary has particularly suffered under the oppression of this unholy element. And so it is quite understandable that before the war there were only 8 companies In this western territory, to compare with the 3 million Inhabitants living in this part. The clergy organized the people and held them so tenaciously under their influence that hardly had the publishers begun their preaching work when they were arrested. Since the war we have been able to make two circuits of this same territory, and the servants to the brethren have 65 towns to visit regularly there, with 38 organized companies. The clergy continue to do all in their power to cause the people to interrupt the witness work. The servants to the brethren send in most interesting reports of their hand-to-hand tussles when they work a village with its inhabitants so drunken with religion’s wine. We give one report here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When I visited a town with purely Catholic population to serve the little company there the brethren told me that the people, agitated by the Catholic clergy, proceed against them with wild hatred. I experienced this literally the same night. I was awakened out of my dreamless sleep by a terrific crash. Looking around me I saw the householder come in and together we saw to our astonishment that someone had smashed in our windows, frames as well. We learned afterward that this barbarous act was committed by persons who had been incited to do so by the priest. The following day we went together to work in a neighboring village. The priest sent the children home from school to tell the people that the Jehovahists were there and no one should listen to them. Thereupon the rosary-bedecked women formed such a battle-array with sticks and stones and broomsticks that we had to stop the house-to-house work. About 30 houses remained unworked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The next day we visited another village. As we made our way home in the afternoon I suggested to the brethren that we go and work the 30 houses left the day before. The brethren fell in with my suggestion, although one or two were a little reluctant because of the incident of the previous day, but we quickly worked the houses without anything unpleasant befalling us. On the contrary, a sister joined us afterward, her face aglow with pleasure and said: ‘A woman just clasped her hands and exclaimed in astonishment, Are you here again? They said yesterday that if you came again they would beat you to death. Haven’t you been beaten up? Give me a booklet too; I would like to know why the clergy are so mad about you. I only heard how they shouted, “Jehovah, Jehovah,” but I didn’t know what it was all about. Come and see me again; we won’t send you away. I gave her a booklet and noted her address. My fear just dissolved into joy!’ As we turned our steps homeward, with thankful hearts we talked over these things and rejoiced that even In the darkest villages there are people of good-will who want to learn the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the remotest corners of the country the publishers, together with the servants to the brethren, have many experiences. It sometimes happens that the priest himself leads the mob furnished with sticks and stones to chase the brethren out of the place; and they have been regularly showered with stones. Thanks to Jehovah’s protection, no serious injuries have occurred yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren do not experience such united action against them in other parts of the country, although the clergy there are not Inactive. They do everything in their power to retard or disturb the work. They run to the authorities constantly with complaints and accusations, but the present democratic authorities are more sober-minded, and their charges are usually ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An experience had by two servants to the brethren will serve to demonstrate the sober-minded judgment of the present competent authorities: “In one place we arranged for a public lecture and Invited the whole community to attend. The head of the board of control of that town appeared among the audience and approached us with the request that he might speak a word of greeting to the audience before the lecture started. I was a bit shocked, thinking at first he might say something disadvantageous to our lecture, but I was forced to grant his request. He then said, among other things, that he could not decline our request when we came to him for the use of the hall to hold our lecture. He recalled that we had been much persecuted in the past and had repeatedly stood before the bayonets of the gendarmery. Democracy bad brought freedom of expression and freedom of worship for all, however, and, although he did not know us and our beliefs, we should nevertheless have the right to worship according to our consciences.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest difficulty is being caused by the obligatory religious instruction of our children. Although the religious schools have come under state control, an old law is still in force from prewar days whereby religious instruction remains obligatory. If a child does not attend religious instruction, they do not allow it to advance into the higher classes even if it is otherwise an excellent pupil. The brethren send one petition after another to the ministry of public worship and education to have their children freed from obligatory religious instruction, but till now not one of them has been successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A tremendous assistance to us in the execution of the work has been the gifts which in Jehovah’s providence our American brethren have sent to us. We received over 8 tons of clothing, which enabled the publishers to go decently clad into the service and also the many who had been hindered from participating through lack of adequate clothing to also have a share in the proclamation work. The garments have been distributed among 1,800 brothers and sisters and 882 children. In addition to this we received 1,000 CAKE food parcels, which were a tremendous help to the Bethel family, the pioneers, and especially for the brethren living in the cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consignment of 15,000 copies of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font6">which was also sent from America at your instructions, has occasioned great joy and appreciation among the brethren. This generous gift put at our disposal at last a bound book that we could offer to the people of good-will. And this, together with the consignment of 50,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;</span><span class="font6"> sent us from Switzerland, has relieved our literature needs somewhat. All these things have worked together in assisting us In the true worship among the people of good-will. For all these blessings we offer up our heartfelt thanks to Jehovah God through His Son, Christ Jesus, and we also express our thanks to you and our brethren unselfishly supporting you for your loving devotion on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A shadow has fallen upon the joys that we have been able to share during this service year, however. This has been caused by the fact that we have been unable to publish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> since January of this year. We have made great efforts, have used every possible means In our power, but received only promises from the competent authorities in return. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has not been forbidden, but—as they say—the permit cannot be given for the time being for reasons that they are unable to state. We then resolved, until such time as the permit to print here is issued, to approach you for permission to have these printed for us by our brethren in Switzerland. We rejoice greatly and express our heartfelt thanks for your agreement to this suggestion. The first issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> reached us at the end of August and gave rise to much joy and enthusiasm among the brethren.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">1947 and 1948 will long be remembered as a period of turmoil and strife in India. Political independence was gained, but at a great cost to the people. They claimed India as their motherland, yet their religions divided them. All the world has read with horror of the terrible massacres that took place in India and Pakistan as millions of the people fled from one section of the country to another for refuge. What the ultimate outcome will be to the nation it is impossible to predict, but Jehovah's witnesses in India, Pakistan and surrounding territory have work to do, and that is to bring to these people the message of the Kingdom. This they have diligently done in the past year, and in all the territory that comes under the Branch at Bombay splendid work has been done. Definite increase can be seen as to the number of publishers, and that means the people are taking their stand for the truth, appreciating the necessity of carrying on true worship in these nations where darkness envelops the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">India is noted for doing things in a crude and old-fashioned way. The people move slowly; in fact, the whole country has a pace all its own. Europeans and those from the Western world find it a bit irritating, but if they are to preach the gospel of the Kingdom they must accustom themselves to the habits of the people. Despite the great change in the way of life for the missionaries who have gone there from Gilead, they have enjoyed their privileges of service and look forward to greater opportunities. The Branch servant reports some interesting things about India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the difficulties, the past year has been one of expansion of Kingdom activity in India. The difficulties have merely retarded the rate of expansion. The first serious handicap that had to be removed was inadequate accommodation at the Branch office and Bethel home. For many months we had a small printing machine lying in Its packing case at the Branch office for lack of accommodation. One of the bedrooms was turned Into a typesetting room but there was not room for the press. Type was set for the Malayalam </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> but we had to go to an outside printer for the actual printing. Diligent search and advertising in the newspapers failed to locate any suitable premises and finally a crude sort of shed, without electricity, two and a half miles from the Branch office was rented. It is far from ideal, but we are glad to be able to have some place where we can operate our own small press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pushing the advance of true worship in India calls for ministers able to speak fluently in the vernaculars of the country, and armed with literature in those vernaculars. Lack of such ministers and lack of such literature has long been, and still is, the biggest obstacle to expansion in this land. In former years we have distributed much English literature, and a limited amount of vernacular literature, but this has reached but a small fraction of the populace. Now an earnest effort is being made to overcome this obstacle. A foundation is being laid; we hope the superstructure will grow apace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taking a general survey of Kingdom activities in this land it must be said that so far there has been no real response to the truth from non-Christian communities. What expansion there has been has been from among those who already profess the Christian religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Translations have been made, or are being prepared, in Malayalam, Marathi, Kanarese, Tamil, Singhalese and Urdu. Translators are not easy to find, except in Malayalam, Marathi and Kanarese, for we have brethren knowing these languages. Some have undertaken to do the work and then let us down. But the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People</span><span class="font6"> has already been printed in Malayalam and Singhalese, while the Marathi edition is on the press. We hope to follow up with translations of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font6"> which will give us a solid foundation for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A word of appreciation is due for the blessings of Gilead school. India, Ceylon and Pakistan now have ten Gilead-trained ministers, with more on the way, and two having gone to Gilead from this land. We look for still more to come to us to help with this ‘‘strange work” of preaching a Theocratic Government as the only possible hope for man. India certainly is a distressed land. Steeped in a superstition and utterly pagan philosophy that baffles description, her people, as a whole, are not teachable. They are arrogant and proud of their theories of metempsychosis, claiming they are more advanced than any other peoples by reason of these “deep, spiritual hypotheses”. The idea that fish were created as fish to be nothing more than fish, or birds were never to be anything but birds, or that man was created as a human son of God to live as man and never be anything different is, to a Hindu, just so much childish ignorance. His philosophy is far In advance of that! And religion confirms his darkness. The Gilead graduates, new to this country, are having their eyes opened to the unbelievable depths of superstitious ignorance that permeates the Hindu mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As I write this report the Hindus are celebrating their feast of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ganpati. Ganpati</span><span class="font6"> is an elephant-headed man-god, and the streets of Bombay today are crowded with Hindus carrying clay images of this “god” with great pomp and ceremony to their homes to be worshiped. The festival ends after several days’ rejoicing by immersing the idol in the sea, or other convenient water. All government offices, banks, business houses, factories, and markets are closed in honor of this particular “god”; it is his birthday!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only truth can set men free from such foolishness, and that only by the spirit or active force of Jehovah God. We recognize that we are powerless to make a person see the truth, for it is the Devil that purposely blinds men to truth. All we can do is to take the truth to the people and aid those who want to know in their study of truth. This is truly a blessed work, and we rejoice in having so privileged a part in it. As the new service year opens up we in India will “contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints”, and search for people of good-will in every community.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Branch office of the Society located in Bombay, India, looks after the work in Ceylon, Pakistan and Iran. In Ceylon there are four Gilead graduates who are working the island. The principal city is Colombo, and these missionaries are doing excellent work there, averaging 193 hours for every month of the past year. They have enjoyed a 108-percent increase in number of publishers, and now Jehovah’s witnesses number a peak of 27 Kingdom proclaimers. A few items of interest were sent in by the Branch servant concerning Ceylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a time the graduates rented a house ’way out in the suburbs. Housing shortage made it difficult to find accommodation elsewhere, but some months ago they obtained a house in the city. They work among a people of mixed religions. Buddhism predominates, many are Hindus, and there is a minority of professing “Christians” belonging to the various denominations, with Roman Catholics perhaps the more numerous. Since Ceylon obtained its political freedom the state religion of Buddhism has taken a surge forward, and the regular “Christian” missionaries are having a hard time of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local company was organized in the closing months of 1947. It is now well established. Some who seemed strong for truth have been enticed away from its service by the attractions of this old world, and some have become fainthearted. But more have shown courage and determination to stand for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and they are bearing fruit. All features of Kingdom work have been engaged in, though the company needs to learn the value of back-calls and book studies. Recently they got the use of a very beautiful Kingdom Hall, and there is every reason to anticipate expansion during 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As in India, one of the greatest obstacles is the language problem. Many, of course, read English, but the majority read only Singhalese. There is also a large minority of Tamil-speaking Indians in the island. During the year the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> was translated, type set up, plates prepared, and printed at the Brooklyn factory. Shipment is now eagerly awaited. The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> is being translated. With adequate vernacular literature, and publishers who can speak Singhalese, there should be real expansion of the true worship of Jehovah God in this “Pearl” of the Indian ocean.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>IRAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The ancient land of Persia is now known as Iran. Here there is a great field to be opened for spreading the Kingdom message. The population is about ten million, most of whom are of the Shia sect of Mohammedanism, but there are also followers of the prophet Zoroaster as well as a large number of Armenian Christians living in this land. A few years ago some Persians became interested in the truth while in India, and now one of these brethren has taken up the pioneer work in Iran. It is good to get started with the proclamation of the Kingdom in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For several months this new pioneer worked in the oil town of Abadan. Soon his reports began to come in, each filled with enthusiasm and joy, for the Lord was prospering his work. February, 1948, was his first month as a pioneer and he obtained 51 new subscriptions for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines. Gradually interest was found, and, of course, some opposition. But a splendid start has been made, with a few book studies going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His work seems to have found most response among the Armenians. There is need for literature in Armenian, and French, and, of course, Persian. The booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> has been translated into Persian, but difficulty is being met with in finding someone to do the originals from which the photoengraved plates can be made; the Persian script is usually lithographed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The latest report from this lone pioneer shows he is having studies with Armenians and Assyrians, and rejoicing greatly. He yearns for a companion and hopes that some Gilead graduates may be sent to Iran to help forward the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The newly formed state of Pakistan came into existence just a year ago. It is a Moslem state separated from India chiefly because of the religious differences between the Hindus and the Moslems. All the world knows something of the political upheaval and the refugee problem that existed in that country, and it is under just such tense conditions that the work of true worship has progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was under such conditions that two Gilead graduates went to Karachi, the capital, in February last. Already a company composed of Anglo-Indians was functioning, having about 12 regular publishers. Great was their enthusiasm and pleasure when these graduates from Gilead arrived, and a feeling of new life was infused into the company. It soon grew from 12 to 21 publishers, and one of them enrolled as a general pioneer. There is one other company organized in Pakistan, far away to the north at the border town of Quetta. Here two pioneers are at work, while another has been working among the poor native “Christians” in the Punjab province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main population is of the Mohammedan (Moslem) faith, and their chief languages are Urdu, Sindhi and Punjabi. So far the publishers have only English literature with which to work, but translations are being prepared In Urdu. Meanwhile the work is conducted mostly among the English-reading “Christians” and the relatively few Mohammedans who can read English and are sufficiently broadminded to investigate the message of the Bible. Though only two companies are organized, these have been served in the usual way by a servant to the brethren, followed by circuit assemblies conducted in the usual way, with well-attended public meetings. A pioneer is assigned to serve as servant to the brethren twice in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pakistan being a Moslem state, where rather strong feelings abound concerning other faiths, it remains to be seen how it will deal with foreign missionaries. So far there has been no interference with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, though there is evidence that some provincial authorities would be glad to see the work of Bible-preaching curtailed. It may be that foreign missionaries will be tolerated only if they engage in purely social work, but the fact remains that there is a very real need for the people of Pakistan to hear about the Theocratic Kingdom of Jehovah God, which alone can make the country a holy land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is a joy to know that the true worship of God is being carried on in Italy. For years the Society has made great effort to promote true worship there, and now, by his grace, the Society is established and many have taken their stand for the truth. Knowing that the work of praise must be done “yet more and more”, the Society recently opened up a Branch office in Rome. Heretofore we had an office in Milan, but, due to circumstances, it seemed advisable to transfer the direction of the Lord’s work in Italy to Rome. There are now five persons working in the Branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having in mind greater expansion in Italy, the Society arranged to teach Italian to one group of students in the twelfth class, now going through Gilead. These brethren will be sent to Italy just as soon after graduation as it can be arranged. The common people among the Italians love truth, and in Italy there is a wonderful field for the preaching of the gospel. Jehovah’s witnesses want to help these “other sheep” gain the true knowledge of God, and those of Jehovah’s witnesses who are already in Italy are anxious to perform their work properly. The Branch servant gives us an interesting report of what they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We started off the service year with a total of 151 publishers, hit our first peak in October, and continued making new peaks month after month for eight months, reaching a peak of 430 in May and then making a jump up to 454 in August, the last month. As the Theocratic organization geared into action similar peaks were realized in all features of the witness work, literature placements, back-calls, and book studies. The brethren began to show an appreciation for the wonderful publications recently received from the Brooklyn office and did their best to introduce them to the public and then to follow up with many return visits upon newly Interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some, in the beginning, were inclined to feel that the work would not make much progress in this priest-controlled country and that the people under influence of the clergy would never listen to the truth. But the contrary was realized, and those who may have made hasty conclusions soon saw visible evidence that there was a great work to be done in Italy and that thousands of good-will would welcome the Kingdom message, if only given the chance. The people are Catholic only by birth, not by choice. Among such are to be found thousands and thousands who really are of good-will and who deserve to be given the opportunity of knowing what real Christianity is. For this reason witnessing in this virgin territory is a pleasure and, instead of our encountering any unusual opposition, generally the people are agreeable and turn a hearing ear. The brethren all feel that there is much to be done and are eager to do their part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the public meeting campaign was introduced and made good progress. Most of all, we lacked speakers because the Italian brethren have not had Theocratic ministry training. The desire to preach the gospel by means of public meetings existed, however, and the brethren organized a public meeting whenever a speaker was available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following illustrates the wonderful possibilities that lie ahead in the public-speaking work. A public meeting was arranged in the city of M----and, in spite of the pres</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sure applied against the local authorities by the clergy, a hall was obtained and permission received to hold the lecture. The speaker began to talk before an attendance of about 35 persons. Within ten minutes, a mob of about 150 persons led by the local priest filed into the hall. These had come for the very purpose of breaking up the meeting, and during the hour lecture made several attempts to cause a disturbance. However, the resoluteness and courage on the part of the speaker and the brethren present defeated the purpose of the Catholic actionists. The speaker continued to the very end of his talk, showing how religion had been responsible for the present world’s woes and had brought suffering and distress to the peoples of earth, and concluding with the hope of the Kingdom as the only hope for the unhappy peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of the discourse the chagrined and stung clergyman wanted to seek revenge in a sneaky, religious manner, that is, by ridiculing the speaker and all of Jehovah’s witnesses, saying that they spoke without authority. Upon being challenged by the speaker to a public debate with the Bible as sole authority, the religionist hemmed and hawed a bit and then beat a hasty retreat. As his predecessors had done in the days of Jesus, he went to seek “consolation&quot; from the strong-arm squad. Whereupon, on the following day the brethren were called before the police, who tried to intimidate the brethren, threatening them witli arrest if they spoke again. The brethren did not give up, but presented their case before the mayor, who assured them that they had every right to exercise their freedom to worship God as guaranteed by the Italian constitution. With this the brethren arranged another public meeting immediately. The Catholic action!sts were not present this time, but saw to it that the police were there in their place. These were moved by the good things they heard and by the orderliness of the meeting to express upon leaving at the close that never had they heard anything like this before. Which reminds us of other honest officers hired by religionists to do their “dirty” work in arresting Christ Jesus. Both incidents ended in the same way; the religionists lost out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servant to the brethren work is very necessary in preparing the brethren and organizing them into study groups and companies. In addition to visiting about 50 organized working companies, there are hundreds of isolated back-calls to be visited, scattered all over the country. Every effort is made to contact the good-will, because in several cases such have developed into companies. This back-call file is made up of persons who have written directly to the office for literature and information, others whose names were forwarded by relatives in other countries, and some who learned the truth while in other countries, especially a number of ex-prisoners of war from warcamps in Australia, United States and England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the Branch office of the Society was located in the city of Milan and in the same house owned by the Society lived four Gilead graduates, three of whom did full-time special pioneer work. Good work has been accomplished by these pioneers and it is a pleasure to report that from 4 publishers reporting in the company at the end of 1947 service year 27 engaged in the service at the end of 1948. Of course, there is much work to do in this large industrial city and we confidently look forward to a greater increase yet in the Milan company. More Gilead missionaries can be well used in Milan. We eagerly look forward to the time when such will arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our service report would not be complete without mentioning other joyful events that took place during 1948. The first real </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> campaign for Italy brought a final count of almost 1,000 new subscribers. This proved that a sincere effort had been put forth by the few Kingdom publishers in this land and Jehovah showered a great blessing indeed. Additionally, in the Memorial event of the year commemorating the death of our Lord 862 persons were present at the special meetings held in the country, with just 38 taking the emblems. A sure indication that the Lord is now calling his “other sheep”. So, with the two above reports during the year, we can be certain that the coming year will bring in many more new Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without printed matter the preaching of the gospel in Italy would not spread so rapidly. Hence, this past year saw the distribution of the greatest amount of literature ever distributed in Italy and soon our stock on hand was depleted. Many months in advance application for a license to Import literature had been made to the Ministry of Commerce. We encountered numerous obstacles on the part of the government and after a long investigation of our organization in order to determine the Christian and nonprofit nature of our work, the Ministry granted us a license in the month of August. So, now we rejoice to know that very soon we shall receive 2,000 kilograms of Bible literature, containing heart-cheering Bible truths for the depressed and meek Italian persons of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year we completed the translation of our latest book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Ood Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> and are now looking forward to the time when we can receive tens of thousands of this thrilling book for the Italian people. Additionally, the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> was translated, and during the same month of August permission was received from the president’s office to print 100,000 copies here in Italy. We believe that by October, 1948, this thrilling booklet will be ready for distribution. Since May, 1947, after Brother Knorr’s welcome visit and good instructions, we had been mimeographing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> from 300 to 500 every month. Finally, in May, 1948, it was decided to have them printed, because now we needed about 700 copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font6">every month for the brethren. Furthermore, judging from the increase we have enjoyed during the past year, it is certain that 1949 will bring in a greater increase yet and we want to prepare for it, having the necessary spiritual food for our brethren and persons of good-will rapidly associating with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A blessed privilege and a happy occasion that we shall not forget was the service rendered our brethren in providing them with 200 food packages and about 5 tons of clothing. This was made possible by our American and Canadian brethren and hard work on the part of our Bethel colaborers. Because the actual publishers in Italy had increased so quickly during the first part of the year, the 200 food packages destined for Italy were happily divided among 400 or so publishers. But the clothing was sufficient to bring joy and comfort to more than 800 brethren and good-will persons. All of these undoubtedly want to express their gratitude to the cheerful givers, but principally to Jehovah God and his earthly organization that made the gift possible. Many were the expressions of thanks transmitted to the Italian office with the request that the same be made known to their companions overseas. The food packages for the publishers in Milan, together with all the clothing, arrived at the Branch home on the eve of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can be no doubt now that the Lord is gathering His “other sheep” from Italy as well, a country that has been in religious bondage many centuries and probably more directly ruled by the clergy than any other land. The Hierarchy is fighting hard against her political enemies in order not to lose her lofty religio-political control of Italy. While these two opponents strive, Jehovah’s witnesses press on tn their God-given commission and avail themselves of the democratic liberties and rights. We are certain that there is much work to do in Italy and that it is a blessed privilege to represent Jehovah God in these days, as one of his ordained ministers. The way Jehovah has prospered his organization in Italy and blessed his servants is a sure sign that the work will continue to make good progress and much greater increases. We are starting off the new service year with a new Branch home, over 450 Kingdom announcers, more than 50 companies better organized than a year ago, a new shipment of Bible literature on the way, and with the promised assistance of well-trained Gilead missionaries. Thanks be unto Jehovah for his “unspeakable gift”!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In the Caribbean sea there is a beautiful island 49 miles wide and 144 miles long. This is the island of Jamaica, with a population of 1,340,400. With everincreasing volume, the good news of God’s kingdom has gone forth in this little place. It has been a sweet song to people of good-will, and the “other sheep” have been gathered rapidly. Of the total population, approximately 15,000 are white, the remainder colored. It is among this latter and larger group that the greater amount of interest is shown. Jamaica has had a 23-percent increase in the average number of publishers in the field service during, the year, and some interesting excerpts from the Branch servant’s report are here printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has been a marvelous year In our eyes, and Jehovah’s doings among his people here have certainly brought joy to our hearts as we have seen the months skip by, bringing new peaks of Kingdom publishers in seven months of the year. As reported last year the peak of publishers came in August, 1,411, and this year August saw a joyful throng of Kingdom singers reporting a new year peak of 1,7391 an increase of 328 over last year. This makes one publisher to care for 771 persons in this rugged, mountainous island of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first delightful and beneficial assembly month was in November with Brother Steelman’s refreshing and stimulating visit, when four two-day assemblies were held in strategic cities on the island. It put us off to a grand start by refreshing our minds with the knowledge of the absolute need for those living for the New World to be “New World minded” by entirely following the clean commands of the Lord through his Word. He forcefully argued that the Lord’s organization is clean and Theocratic, so those desiring to enter the portals of the New World, no matter of what nationality or race, have to match up to the standards of Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All too soon his month’s visit ended, but not the Lord’s work! On it must go, for did not he help us to remember that once we consecrate to do Jehovah’s will we must be faithful and progress to the very end? So with fresh vigor and determination the brethren pushed ahead in the next months looking ahead anxiously to the circuit assemblies in the spring as well as to the Memorial celebration. 2,823 attended the Memorial, while 267 partook of the emblems in accordance with their covenant for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One pioneer working with a small company has been doing faithful work, which is shown by the circulation of a pamphlet by the local “parson” stating among other things about Jehovah’s witnesses, ‘(1) They do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, (2) They do not believe that Jesus Christ who was crucified was raised from the dead, and (3), These people are false witnesses; and he admonished his parishioners to “hold fast to the faithful word”.’ The brother took this pamphlet all through the district and made a contrast of it with the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> to every household, and they had to admit the “parson” was a false witness ; and as a result found many more of good-will to God and his faithful Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servants to the brethren have many happifying experiences which make glad the heart. One servant to the brethren reports that while serving a small company of about five publishers his public lecture was delivered in the “Church of God” church building with two hundred in attendance, the talk having been widely advertised. The “parson” himself introduced Brother ------. The parson</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and his family of nine children were visited by the servant to the brethren right after that and a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font6">study was started with them. He reports that “their heavengoing minds were carried back to the Paradise Earth with its perfect rule of the princes under God’s kingdom”. Some of the people were accusing him of becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses—as if it were a dishonor'to witness for the Most High God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hope and pray that the increase will still come as a result even as it has in the past year. During the year 240 in total were Immersed, and August saw the new peak of publishers reach 1,739! Endurance to the end, individually and as a group singing Jehovah’s praises, is a fully determined thing in the hearts of the brethren in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In Japan there are a few scattered brethren who sincerely believe the Kingdom promises and are anxious to engage in field service. For nine years now, since the work of the Society was banned in Japan and all literature confiscated, there has been no well organized field service. A few of Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan have written to the Society recently, asking for literature and assistance, and every effort is being made to aid them. Some individual witnessing has been done, mostly among neighbors and friends, but two newly interested brethren, both of whom are schoolteachers, have associated themselves with the Lord’s servants in Japan. As they have opportunity they bring the truth to the attention of the children in school, and so the seed is planted for future truthlovers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plans for the reorganization and expansion of the work in Japan are now well under way. During the year seven brethren were called to Gilead for training preparatory to service in Japan. Five of these arc Japanese-Americans with a good knowledge of Japanese. One of the brethren acted as student instructor, teaching the Japanese language at Gilead to a class of 22. With these graduates ready and eager to take up the work in Japan, we look forward to splendid progress in that country in 1949. The Society has obtained permission from the United States government to send its first missionary into Japan to organize the local brethren and make preparations for the entry of more missionaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">La Torre del Vigia de Mexico, A.C., is the Society that directs the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Mexico. It is an educational organization, and Jehovah’s witnesses are truly educators at the world’s end. These educators carry on the work in Mexico the same as Jehovah’s witnesses do in all other parts of the world, except that they do not conduct public meetings nor do they open or close their meetings with prayer or songs, because this is considered religious by the government. Of course, persons are allowed to pray in private, but if prayer is offered at a public meeting, then it must be in a church building, dedicated for that purpose and provided by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A number of assemblies were arranged for during the year and were held with great benefit to the people. One of the big obstacles to the preaching of the gospel is the lack of education of the majority of the inhabitants. Consequently, one of the great works that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in Mexico is teaching persons to read and write, in addition to bringing them the truth of God’s Word. The servant in charge of La Torre del Vigia sends an interesting report to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers have been informed as to the way we must carry on the witness work, and all have co-operated. So, through mainly the door-to-door work and the back-call and book-study work, by the Lord’s grace, the number of publishers has Increased marvelously. We passed our quota of 4,400 publishers for 1948, our average being 4,542, and we reached a peak of 5,708 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By attending one of our assemblies, like the one we had in April, it is possible to get a bird’s-eye view of the general condition of the Mexican publisher. The majority of the brethren are very obedient and zealous but deplorably poor as to the necessities of life. Very few have had any education. Very few had the necessary funds to stay in hotels. During the assembly they stayed in the homes of the local brethren and slept on the floor. We used two of our Kingdom Halls as large dormitories, as most of the publishers brought a blanket or two. Many came to the assembly with just enough money to get here and not enough to eat or get back, but somehow they always seem to manage. The difficult times they have do not dampen their Theocratic spirit because each assembly we have is one of their main topics of conversation for a long time afterward and the question the brethren continually ask is, When are we going to have another assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even though our servants to the brethren suffer from all types of sicknesses, from poor living conditions and absolutely disheartening means of transportation, the Lord blesses them with His spirit and grants them better-than-average field experiences. One reports that “on arriving to visit a certain company I found that the brethren had been cited to appear before the authorities to attempt to arrange some affair that had to do with their children in the public school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The brethren told me that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">presidente municipal,</span><span class="font6"> the local mayor, desired to know all the details about our educational work. One of the company publishers accompanied me to their city hall and we invited the mayor to the main talk I was to give to the company. The mayor came accompanied by a lawyer, a school inspector and the teacher of our young brethren in the public school. There were more than 200 in attendance and all of them paid close attention to the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All were much pleased with the lecture and then some general advice was given them. The meeting was opened to questions and answers, and all of the questions of the brethren were answered to their satisfaction. Then the lawyer asked why it was that all of the school-age publishers refused to take part in all of the civic ceremonies held in the public school. I answered his question Scripturally and according to the Constitution. On citing from the Constitution I pointed out to him that each one has a right to his own belief and that the ceremonies he had mentioned were purely military. I also stated that if one person forced another person to do something contrary to his will, that the first person becomes a dictator, and that is something that none of us wanted. It was pointed out to him that those things were contrary to our individual belief and then Isaiah 62:10 and Exodus 17:15 were cited showing how the name of Jehovah is to be honored and that He is the real Liberator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The question was answered to his satisfaction. The lawyer stated that we expressed ourselves very well, answering questions from different angles without offending anyone. The mayor stated that our deportment was very different from what the religious fanatics had told him and that he was willing to help us out all he possibly could. They all took literature and promised to read it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another interesting experience from a servant to the brethren reads: “I was traveling on a train in which the greater part of the passengers in our particular coach were traveling agents and among them a doctor. In a discussion they started they attempted to fathom why it was that in spite of modern transportation, inventions, medicines, etc., there were so many famines, wars, shortages, sicknesses and deaths. All gave their own opinions in an attempt to explain the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;But how they contradicted themselves! It wasn’t long before the volume of their voices seemed to announce a coming fight. Suddenly they ail turned to me, since I had remained silent, and I was questioned as to what my ideas on the subject were. My answer was that the reason they argued so much was that none of them had read of the truth and because the greater part of the people spent all their time reading comic books, joke books and other similar literature and that none of that could be used to teach humanity the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I presented some books and booklets and stated their relation to the Bible and the fact that the literature presented to them the truth as to the questions they had not been able to understand. The nine books and thirteen booklets I had with me were placed in less than five minutes and their heated argument was quickly converted into some quiet searching questions with regard to the truth. One of them stated that he had heard of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> publications and that it was a real joy to have one of their books in his hands. I invited them to a district assembly we were to have in a few days in the city of Veracruz, and you can imagine the joy I felt when I saw the doctor very much interested among us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a whole, our service year has been a peaceful one and a blessed one, for which we are thankful to the Lord. Our hope and prayer is that by the time our next yearly report is written we shall have continued to advance as previously and that by then all of the publishers in Mexico will know how to read and write.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The conditions in the war-torn country of Netherlands, which is just now recovering from the global war, were of such a nature that many hardships and difficulties were heaped upon the faithful, full-time servants. They have rationing, a housing shortage, and many other difficulties. These things, however, have not retarded the onward advance of Kingdom preaching; in fact, we find an 11-percent increase in number of publishers serving the Kingdom. Now there is an average of 4,190 of Jehovah’s witnesses serving every month in the field. While there has been a drop in the total number of hours put in field witnessing by the servants of the Most High, there has been a marked increase in the number of back-calls and book studies conducted, and public meetings have also jumped ahead considerably. These last three features of service were the important factors in the advance of Kingdom publishers. The Branch servant tells the story, which you will find interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new arrangement for the full-time service was greatly appreciated when it was announced in the January </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Inform^ ant.</span><span class="font6"> Now many brethren are encouraged to take up the grand privileges and joys of this service and the number of pioneers is increasing slowly. At present less than 4 percent of all publishers are on the pioneer list. That the provision for engaging in part-time secular work not only proves to be of benefit for the pioneers themselves, but also can be a good testimony for the Kingdom, is proved by a letter of a group of pioneer sisters, part of which is quoted here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As we could not get around with the assistance of our book placements we decided to do some secular work, namely, picking berries in a big fruit garden of a farmer. There were also other women at work whom we had met at the doors with the message of God’s kingdom. Soon it became known that the Jehovah’s witnesses girls were picking berries too. The farmer, who didn’t like religion, started to ask us questions and then took some literature, stating, ‘That is a belief at least! Working for your bread and preaching at the doors still! How is it possible? I respect you people highly, and whenever church people are going to slander you, I will tell them that their priest is not even fit to hold a candle to you. You are not preaching for money like in the church.’ After we had finished picking berries the farmer said, ‘You have been my best workers. All the others don’t care what they are picking and are squeezing a lot of berries, just to gather a heap in the shortest time possible, and then they throw them in the boxes and put a lot of leaves at the bottom. But your work was all right; you are the best workers I have had in years.’ Some time afterwards one of us</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">placed several books with people who were atheists, according to their own words, and who had heard that we were preaching the gospel and yet were not ashamed to do farming work. One of these persons is living quite a distance away from the farm and now wants a back-call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The southern part of the Netherlands is a section of the country in which the Branch office has always been very much Interested. There are a number of cities of considerable size where there were no publishers and where the hierarchy’s dominion was still untouched. Therefore it was a great Joy to us to get permission from Brother Knorr to enroll more specials that could be sent to those virgin territories to find the people of good-will, nourish and feed them, get them organized for the field service, and establish them in the true worship of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s freight boat “Deborah” was quickly transformed into a pioneer boat and manned with a crew of four full-time ministers. Their assignment was a city that had been covered several times before and during the war by publishers from a neighboring company who would take an hour’s ride by train to witness there. Although many interested persons were located this way, it was impossible to properly take care of those “sheep” by calling back regularly and feeding them with the truths from the Word of God. So there was not any definite progress. But the work was not in vain. The bread of life was cast upon the waters, and after many days the pioneers found it. (Eccl. 11:1) One book study after the other was established. Hundreds of back-calls were made regularly. With obedience and zeal the territory was covered four times. One brother wrote: “Now I have covered my territory for the fourth time and still I was able to establish more book studies (2 more) and arrange for 3 new back-calls to be made. This shows how profitable it Is to work through a territory four times. In this territory I found 5 new publishers; two have been baptized already and one of them will enter the pioneer service next month. Last month our company had </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> peak of 21 publishers.” Blessed is the portion of those that are serving Jehovah day by day. May the Joyful experiences of the pioneers move many others to shake off the yoke of worldly bosses and to enter the full-time ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the end of the war many attributes of the dally life and many material goods that were absent during the war started to require time and energy again. Also the Kingdom publisher found himself more and more confronted with the returning burdens of “civilized” life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fewer hours spent in the field results in fewer book placements and fewer opportunities for back-calling. The back-call work needs all our attention too. Though the total number of back-calls made during the year was higher than last year, the average number per publisher was lower. During our last series of circuit assemblies special emphasis was put on this feature of the service which gives us such excellent chance to feed the “sheep”. On the other hand, the average number of book studies going every month has increased by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">44</span><span class="font6"> percent compared with last year. It is through the book studies that good results are brought about in interesting the people in the truth and helping them to take their stand for the Kingdom. We can have good hope for the future as far as an increase in the number of publishers is concerned. Around 6,000 persons are associated with the company organizations; at this year’s Memorial celebration the attendance was 5,900, of which 35 partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the United States under the agreements of the European Recovery Program is sending great quantities of valuable supplies to the needy European countries, such as the Netherlands, the Theocratic organization in that part of the world is also making friends in this country. This Theocratic “aid program” consists of CARE food parcels, clothing and bedding, and books. Three hundred parcels containing good food were sent for our full-time ministers and other needy and worthy persons. A fifth shipment of clothing, consisting of 9 tons, was distributed among nearly 4,000 persons, bringing the total number of tons received in this country to 64. As a man does not live by literal food and clothing alone, 200,000 copies of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“De Waarheid Zal V Vrij-maken&quot; (“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;)</span><span class="font6"> were shipped to this country to be used in the great educational work carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses. May Jehovah bless our efforts to put all these books in the hands of the people who hunger and thirst for truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the coming service year w<sup>r</sup>e will, by the Lord’s grace, continue to push the advance of true worship, taking advantage of the many provisions that Jehovah has given us through his Theocratic organization upon the earth. While thus we are faithfully doing our work we will pray that he may give the increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Said the wise writer Solomon, “A good report mak-eth the bones fat.” Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland know this statement to be true through years of hard work, and particularly during the good service year of 1948, when they saw their ranks expand 57 percent. More hours were spent in the field, a greater number of back-calls made, more book studies conducted regularly, more than a 100-percent increase in number of public meetings—all of this as shown in their year’s report brings joy to the publishers of the Kingdom in Newfoundland. Their feeling now is to praise Jehovah more and more. The report from the Branch servant indicates that that is just what they are going to do there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First of all it would be well to give you a very brief picture of the Island and the conditions under which the witnesses of Jehovah God testify of the incoming Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Newfoundland is the tenth-largest island in the world, having an area of about 42,000 square miles. Its coastline is rugged, with many inlets, bays and coves, and stretches out for over 6,000 miles. Along this coastline live approximately 300,000 people in 1,156 little hamlets and villages. There are only five communities with populations exceeding 5,000. St. John’s, the capital, has a population of about 55,000. One can clearly picture, then, the difficulty the publishers have in reaching these people with the message of life. Religion lias found them, however. About forty various kinds of religions flourish here and exploit the humble fisherfolk, blinding them to the truth of God’s Word. There is a big church in practically every little settlement. One can easily pick out the home of the clergyman, as it is the best in the community. Nearly half of the population is held in bondage by the Roman Catholic religious cult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Traveling on the road as servant to the brethren in Newfoundland is no easy task. It is not a matter of jumping on a train or bus and getting to the next company within a matter of a few hours. Although there is one railway line running across the island, yet many of the brethren live in isolated spots accessible only by boat in good weather and by foot, horse or dog sled over rough and wild country when navigation is impossible. Even by boat the servant to the brethren has many hardships. At times he has to row by hand many miles in order to reach his destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Special effort was made at Memorial time to assist the brethren, and the result was a new peak of 154 publishers, which far surpassed our fondest expectations, as our previous peak had been only 90. At this time each strong publisher tried to assist one or more weaker publishers into some feature of the service. Even the severe weather that hit Newfoundland during March did not stop the determined publishers. The servant to the brethren writes of his experiences on this special week-end of activity as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For the next week I stay at Lumsden, Every day is filled with Theocratic activity. I have arrived here in time for the Memorial gathering, too. However, Memorial night proves a testing time on us all. By sundown on that day the heavy winds and weather worsens and the most ferocious storm of the year bursts out upon the area. Blinding snow mingled with sand from the beach swirls through the settlement of Lumsden North. It is impossible for the friends from the South Side to come over tonight, and this will bring great disappointment to them. There is but one thing to do, and that is have the Memorial service early on the North Side and then attempt getting to the South Side after. Just how I will get over there in the storm is uncertain. The old folks shake their heads as if to say ‘Try anything for the truth’s sake; Jehovah is with you’. But it is a terrible storm and can easily be disastrous. I don’t relish making the journey alone either, but it isn’t long before I have a volunteer to go along, one who knows every foot of the way in any kind of weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As we take to the beach the shifting sand and blinding spray make progress difficult against the storm. One can easily get lost tonight. We cannot see a hand before our faces. Sand fills our eyes and nostrils, and when we open our mouths to gasp for breath it too becomes coated with sand and becomes sickening as we grind the hard particles between clenched teeth an instant later. Conversation Is impossible, even our words are blown swiftly away on the heavy wind. Our flashlight is of little value In the denseness of the swirling elements of sand and snow. Beneath our feet the slippery ice of the frozen spots causes us to slip, stumble, and fall, and when we rise we know not in which direction we are headed. But for my guide, the trip would be Impossible, for he knows every piece of wreckage on the beach, every rock and fence. For a stranger this trip would surely end in great difficulties. But the effort is crowned with success, and when we finally reach Lumsden South after the storm-battered crossing our bosoms swell with gratitude to Jehovah. The Memorial proved successful in both settlements on the same night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public lecture work has done much to strengthen the publishers themselves. Many of the 112 lectures given during the year were given out in the open air. Group witnessing has always been rather weak, but organized efforts In connection with the public lectures has assisted in overcoming this weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The field in Newfoundland is white and ready for the harvest. Jehovah’s consecrated servants throughout the Island realize their privileges and will unite with their brethren world-wide in their advance to maturity and in their expansion of ministry, thus having, in a small way, a part in the fulfillment of Isaiah 42:10,12, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A. S. V.:</span><span class="font6"> “Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praises from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and inhabitants hereof. Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Throughout the year Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand have had in mind singing praises unto Jehovah among the nations. They had in mind, too, the suggestion that every country try to increase its number of publishers by 10 percent. Knowing that this is the time to gather the “other sheep”, effort must be put forth diligently by all the ministers of the gospel, and the servants of the Most High in New Zealand were not one whit behind those in the other countries in putting forth this effort. Their increase over the previous year was 17 percent in number of publishers. In the three most important features of ministry, namely, time in the field, back-calls and book studies, our New Zealand brethren made good advances. The Branch servant tells us a little about what is going on in this country far to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Companies organized for service have grown to 56, an Increase of 8. These are served by three servants to the brethren, two Gilead graduates being occupied full-time and one part-time. At the beginning of the year we had five circuits, but have now divided the territory, making a total of six, believing that this will improve the co-operation among the brethren and will make for better attendance at the circuit assemblies. Although comparatively small in area, New Zealand is elongated in shape, and stretches 1,000 miles from north to south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of our pioneers has not yet reached the recommended quota, viz., 10 percent of the total publishers. But there has been an increase. Despite the fact that there were some losses in the pioneer ranks due to sickness, death and other causes, the average numbers have grown from 20 to 37, while the number now reporting is 42. The average increase is 85 percent. We believe, however, that more can and will become pioneers during 1949, and we shall progress much farther toward the goal of a pioneer band of publishers representing 10 percent of the total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year lias been one of steady progress void of any outstanding opposition. True, some towns have threatened prosecution of those engaged in street witnessing, but so far nothing has eventuated, and the brethren continue to hold forth the word of life in the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most street witnessing in New Zealand is done on Friday afternoons and evenings. On Saturdays stores close all day and streets are deserted. But on Fridays, crowds of people throng the streets until 9 p.m., the usual closing time for stores on that day. To the publishers, often good-humored passers-by protest that they are “awake”. Or maybe one will hear a loud snore as some jocular person notices the title of the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> But apart from the “funny” people, many persons of good-will are being located by the street work and these come regularly to the publishers to obtain each issue of the magazines. Some are noticed passing many times, until at last they pluck up courage for a magazine and unburden their hearts as to their interest in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New. Zealand is different from America in that all sidewalks in the shopping areas are covered with verandas. Thus publishers are afforded some protection from the rain while engaged as magazine publishers. Recently, a publisher equipped with magazine bag observed a husky six-foot stranger watching him closely while busy on his usual street stand. The publisher was convinced that mischief was brewing. Another publisher, without magazine bag, approached and conversed with publisher No. 1. This was the big stranger’s opportunity to stop what he supposed was interest in the work by a member of the public. He moved over and feigned interest in the work. Then suddenly he grabbed the publisher’s magazines, but failing to wrench them from the publisher’s hand, he swung his right fist to the surprised publisher’s nose, gained possession of his magazines and proceeded to tear them up. Quick as lightning the publisher’s right fist went into action and sent the husky brute sprawling on his back. The big fellow ’quickly recovered himself and again rushed in to attack his smaller opponent, but the second publisher intervened and the bully hurried away from the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The interesting part came after publisher No. 1 changed his shirt (made necessary by the punch on the nose), and returned to his stand on the street. A young lady in the shop opposite witnessed the altercation. She came across and told the publisher he certainly had what it takes to return after the big fellow’s interference. She contributed for magazines and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font6"> and later showed good interest in the work. So it pays to have a part in street witnessing work; for who knows when you may receive a punch in the nose which will result in a book study with one of the Lord’s “other sheep”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We look forward to the coming service year with confidence. We know that our work is imperfect, and much more yet remains to be done in honor of the name of Christ Jesus, our King. We want to see the witness thoroughly given, so that all the people of this land who love righteousness may receive the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message and thus find the way to life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">As one looks at the day-to-day service, no great progress can be noticed; but when one reflects over the past year, then the Lord’s blessing is very discernible. “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.” While there may be many difficulties to face in Nicaragua, with its rain, heat, dust and many other natural obstacles, still the missionaries who serve that land, along with the company publishers, are enjoying to the full the favor of the Lord. When the publishers realize that they have had a 100-percent increase in number of Kingdom witnesses during the year, they will be stirred on to even greater activity for the 1949 service work. There are people of good-will in Nicaragua. It just takes time to find them, and the Branch servant shows how this was accomplished during the past 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Special effort was made during the year to keep the public meeting activity going in full force. The economic situation has been serious throughout the year and placements have dropped considerably. To make up for this lack of literature in the people’s hands public meetings have been held regularly in all sections of the city in theaters and open-air gardens where the people could come to listen “and take of the water of life freely”. This activity has borne fruit in many ways. The largest company, in the capital, has averaged nearly one meeting per week for the entire year. The local brethren have become used to this continuous and strenuous activity and lend their willing hands to advertising and getting their friends to the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servant to the brethren on his visit to Nicaragua pointed out forcefully the deficiencies in the service work and awakened every publisher to the means of remedying the situation. Immediately his suggestions were put into effect and practiced during his two-week visit, and the results were very gratifying. He counseled that the publishers must make a special effort to show more friendliness to the newly interested ones, to enthusiastically “welcome the stranger”. Also that each of the missionaries and other very active publishers must have a list of less active or inactive publishers and people of good-will, so as to check daily and constantly on these new ones and help them to participate in the Lord’s service. They must confess with their mouths to be saved. They would work if only given work to do, and certainly they would not work if not encouraged by active, friendly brethren. They would become “forgetful hearers”. Pioneers, study conductors and regular publishers responded readily to the call and made a real effort to help all of those who had shown interest in the work to take part in the service during July, announcing the public lecture of the coming circuit assembly if nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Steelman took the lead and walked from one end of the capital to the other meeting personally each person that had shown special interest and encouraging them to greater activity. All of these new efforts brought blessings to the second circuit assembly of the year arranged to coincide with Brother Steelman’s visit. His excellent exhortations to service and the other discourses at the assembly made a deep impression and have borne fruit in greatly improved regularity in many features of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Steelman's visit to other cities of the republic uncovered a great need for more capable publishers to take the lead. Everywhere were interested people needing only a book study and instruction to become publishers of the Kingdom. Practically all of the associated persons responded, as well as many new ones in different parts of the country. When July’s report was compiled it was found that the previous peak of publishers had more than doubled in only two weeks’ time, and now the total stood at 146. Here were publishers under our noses that we were overlooking each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enthusiasm and zeal instilled into the brethren by this assembly did not die with the month’s end, but all of them got an early start on the last month of the service year determined to hold the new peak of publishers. Most of the new publishers held their ground, and for the few that did not report that month there were others to take their places. The old peak was left behind by a new one of 154 publishers, the most of whom manifested that they had been inactive long enough. Naturally the Increase in number of publishers brought increases in all features of service, and all were ready to begin the new year looking ahead to see what blessings the Lord had in store for them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Theocratic expansion is as much for the dark continent of Africa as for any other part of the world. The work in Nigeria and other countries of Africa proves that Jehovah’s purpose for gathering together large numbers of His “other sheep” will be done in this continent the same as in every other. The shroud of darkness and superstition that has long enveloped the African people is gradually lifting, and the light of truth is penetrating into the deepest part of the jungle. Companies are organized; circuit assemblies are arranged for ■ pioneers are sent into areas of large population: the work goes on. In Nigeria itself we find that the companies have increased from 201 to 249 during the year; and as to the number of publishers, we find a 48-percent increase, reaching an average of 5,511 publishers in Nigeria. The peak number of publishers was attained in August, when 6,825 were serving the interests of the Kingdom. Some of the hard times, all of which result in great joy eventually, are reported by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By far the most outstanding event of the year was the visit of yourself and Brother Henschel In December. Most readers are already familiar with what took place, through the detailed report published In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> Your lecture &quot;Permanent Governor of All Nations” was heard by appreciative audiences of over 4,000 in Lagos and 6,000 in Ibadan. The Ibadan convention, specially arranged for the Yoruba brethren, of whom some 3,500 were In attendance, was the largest and most important ever held in West Africa, this being the first time a president of the Society had ever visited this land. We were much disappointed that you were unable to meet the brethren In Iboland, due to travel difficulties and mishaps and the need for getting back to Lagos to catch airplane connections. However, the two Gilead graduates, Brothers Attwood and Moreton, after a 3^-mile canoe crossing of the river Niger, and a midnight journey by lorry, did manage to reach Enugu for the convention, and were able to present much of the information given at the Ibadan convention to the 1,600 brethren in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some months later a brief visit to Owo brought an attendance of 580 for a public lecture, and then on to Akure and Oshogbo for two more splendid assemblies. The crowning feature at Oshogbo was Sunday, when the public lecture was to be held in the courtyard of the oba’s palace. The car with the loud-speakers on the roof faced down the length of the courtyard. On the one side sat the oba, complete with golden crown, surrounded by his wives, servants and native police; in front, the crowd of 1,394, all listening intently to the lecture “Permanent Governor of All Nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In April news had been received that our long-awaited printing press was on its way from South Africa. On returning home we were happy to find that the press had been landed and assembled. Next came the task of gathering the necessary equipment so that we could start printing. One of the first items off the press was a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Netos</span><span class="font6"> in Urhobo, the first publication ever printed by the Society in this language. Other </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News, Informant</span><span class="font6"> in English, Yoruba and Ibo, and a variety of other matter, have since come off the press. Only two of the six brethren now working in the printery had done any printing before. But when one applies himself to a new job with the will and desire to learn for the sake of the Lord’s work, It is surprising how quickly he can become efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the four months past a constant lookout had been kept for a suitable building that could serve as a new Bethel home. It was becoming increasingly difficult to care for the work from the old home. The printery was about a mile away, which meant constant running to and fro; the family was housed at three different addresses and yet another place had to be obtained for literature storage. We knew the Lord was mindful of our needs and our untiring efforts to find a suitable place had not gone unnoticed. It was at this point that a new building under erection first came to our notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a happy day when the lease was finally signed. Now we have a fine modern home with every convenience. At ground level there is a dining-room that will seat 24, kitchen, three connected rooms for printing, shipping room and literature store. Above are a small lounge, four bedrooms and two fine connected rooms for the office with an outside stairway. On the top floor is bedroom accommodation for thirteen. Additionally there are showers, bathroom, modern toilets with our own septic tank, and a good compound of convenient size. Much hard work was required to get the building ready. The Bethel family and many brethren from the Lagos units by hard and diligent work transformed the building into a place that is worthy to be called a Branch office of the Society. Everyone is happy and satisfied. Out-activities in connection with the building became the talk of the neighborhood. To see Europeans using paint brushes, laying concrete or plumbing was a sight that African eyes had never before beheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rapid increase in number of publishers, the formation of new companies and the general prosperity of the Lord’s people naturally arouse the ire of the enemy. As in other countries, Innocent school children are singled out as objects for attack. Many of the schools are controlled by religionists and religious exercises of flag-saluting and enforced contributions for “Harvest” or “Easter” funds are some of the occasions used to expel the brethren’s children. Government educational policy forbids religious discrimination or violation of conscience; but the officials are slow to take action, despite the constant protests and appeals made from this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Witch doctors, juju priests and their henchmen, as well as the “Christian” religionists, join together in persecuting the adult brethren. This is the kind of thing that happens: In a village where there are some Kingdom publishers, a demonistlc sacrifice of a pig or some other animal is performed every year as an offering to the fetish gods. Everyone in the village must contribute In money or in kind, and the henchmen of the priest go from house to house disguised in juju garb exacting dues from the villagers. At the brethren’s homes, of course, no contributions are forthcoming. The following night a gang of roughs will probably visit the offending home, break in and steal livestock, money or anything they can lay their hands on. Charges are laid In the native courts and bribes freely handed out to frame the innocent. Of course, the Society always gets in touch with the European district officer when such incidents come to light, and in several cases favorable action has resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past six months, since the inauguration of the new arrangement for pioneers, an increased number have seen their privilege of devoting all their time to the Lord’s work. January saw only about fifty on the list, but now we have nearly 170. As more vernacular literature becomes available, more will doubtless respond. Vernacular literature has long been one of the principal needs of the brethren. The establishment of our printery is a step toward overcoming this problem. It is hoped that by the time this report is read the Yoruba and Ibo brethren will be studying </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in their own language. Recently a consignment of 25,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font6"> in Yoruba arrived from Brooklyn, bringing much joy to the six Yoruba circuits. The translation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> into both Yoruba and Ibo is practically completed, and the Eflk translation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> has already been sent to Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is with deep thankfulness to the Lord and full appreciation of his loving-kindness that this report is submitted. I am sure it will bring much joy to the hearts of those who read it. Words cannot describe the joy of seeing human creatures previously steeped in ignorance, superstition and demonism come fully to a knowledge of the truth and enter upon the roadway that leads to life. I am sure that many more of the “other sheep” are yet to be gathered from among Nigeria’s millions before the great day of Almighty bursts upon this evil world. By His grace, we will continue to labor on till he brings his work to its glorious conclusion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is much interest shown in the Kingdom message in the French colony of Dahomey. This country borders Nigeria on the west. The Nigerian Branch office is looking after the work in Dahomey, and one company has been organized. There have been 140 publishers of the Kingdom working regularly, and before the year ended there were 301 publishers serving the Kingdom interests. How this came about is reported by the Branch servant at Lagos, Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some publishing work was done in Dahomey in the years preceding World War II, when a fair amount of interest was manifested, and some quantities of literature were placed. With the advent of World War II restrictions were placed upon the work by government decree and several of the Nigerian pioneers working there were committed to short terms of imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this territory once more placed under the supervision of the Nigerian Branch, it was felt that some move should be made to open up the work once again. Apart from one or two addresses of interested persons we had no real information as to the true situation. In March of this year a pioneer was sent into the capital, Porto Novo. The results have been simply amazing. A visit was made from this office six weeks later and it was learned that 105 new publishers had joined the pioneer in Kingdom service! Literature is regularly being sent through the mail from Lagos and is all being received. On the occasion of a second visit to Porto Novo we took eight cartons of literature, French and Yoruba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the month of July a further spectacular increase was reported. During the month the pioneer accompanied by a party of brethren from Porto Novo visited a town some thirty miles away. A wonderful reception was enjoyed and he and some of the other brethren remained five days. Large numbers of new interest were taken out in the service, and for that month a report of 301 publishers came in to the office. In his covering letter he explained that he did not Include all who took part in the publishing, as some could not witness very well as yet and had therefore been omitted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>FRENCH TOGOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Between Dahomey and the Gold Coast is a strip of mandated territory known as French Togoland. Before World War I Togoland was one of the German colonies in West Africa, but after the treaty of Versailles it was split between Britain and France, the British section now being administered by the Gold Coast, but the French maintain a separate administration at the capital, Lome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During May a visit was made to Lome for the purpose of interviewing the French officials about opening up the work. The chief of political affairs showed a friendly attitude and said that the government had no objections. Copies of our literature were filed with him. The way now seems to be open to get the work started, but the difficulty in getting a French-speaking, pioneer has caused some delay. Now that a firm bridgehead has been established in Dahomey, it is expected that a push into Togoland can be made in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The gift of service is greatly appreciated by Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway. They appreciate the privilege that is theirs of expressing love to their neighbor. God’s Word says that we should love our neighbor as we do ourselves. With this in mind, the ministers in Norway have seen wonderful results as they have promoted the true worship of Jehovah. In fact, by the end of the service year there was a 24-percent increase in the number of publishers reporting every month, and this alone proves their love for their neighbors. The Branch servant gives us a number of experiences which show how the brethren have expressed their love toward their fellow men and aided them in the way of true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason for these increases can be best shown by the following examples of service exercising neighbor love. One pioneer writes: “I have been concentrating mainly on back-calls and book-study work, and it appears that there will soon be a company here. There are six persons who have expressed a desire to go with me in the field service. Already now they have helped distribute handbills when I am to hold a public lecture. They also talk to those they come in contact with concerning the New World. Some people in the district have circulated different tales about the new friends here. However, they just laugh at such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There were 16 at our regular study here at Rena. Besides this I have several studies outside Rena. Today I am to have a study with some good-will about 10 kilometers from here. They had obtained some literature from Brother L----last</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">summer and have read much since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There were 60 who attended my last public talk, and now the 5th of March I shall hold another talk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A company servant who has recently come into the truth, and a company organized with him this year, writes: “I will also tell you an encouraging experience I had the other day. I came to one of my back-calls, a man of about 30 years of age, who has been acquainted with the truth for about one year. This man related how he had been to visit one of his friends who was sick. Before going he took several publications along with him. While they were talking together the sick man said, ‘Here are some books I have been reading [showing forth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font6"> and several smaller booklets]; what do you think of them?’ The visitor could not but smile as he stated that he thought them very fine and proceeded to show forth the books he had intended to give the sick man, while saying he too had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pioneer writes: “Two of the brethren here are becoming real active. Today they have taken free from their regular work to go to the district minister to withdraw their names from the church books. Three of their brothers, one sister and her husband are also much interested but not yet active publishers. Yes, even more members of this family are interested. Thursday evening at 6:30 both brothers went on back-calls and did not come home until eleven o'clock. One has obtained seventeen subscriptions and has many interested good-will that he steadily keeps ‘warm’ by back-calling on them regularly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Interest in the Kingdom message was shown by a man who had several of the books and who liked them very much. This man had long waited for some of the witnesses to call on him, but no one came. But, where there is a will there is a way, as the saying goes. So he placed an advertisement in the newspaper expressing his desire to come in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. The brethren in a near-by company saw his advertisement and immediately a brother went to find him. He showed real interest and a desire to do something to spread the message out to others. He was given the necessary instructions and invited to come to the circuit assembly to be held soon after this. He was baptized and a company organized with him. He is now a regular publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is quite easy to be a publisher in this country, that is, experiencing little or no difficulty. It is easy to place literature, with the people accepting the publications quite readily. One Danish-born brother had an interesting experience while engaged in witnessing from door to door. He called at a home and the lady of the house answered the door. He proceeded to explain his mission to her and the publication he had. The lady interrupted by saying that which he had and was telling her was an American religion. “No,” said the publisher. “Yes it is,” proceeded the lady, “y ou even talk with an American accent and are wearing American clothes.” The publisher calmly replied that his coat was from Canada, the sweater from America, his pants were Norwegian, the shoes from Sweden and his tie from Denmark, but these books, they are Bible truths. The lady invited him in, where they sat and discussed the Bible and publications further. She accepted a book and booklets and showed an interest to have a return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To us it seems that the Increase this year is due to a clearer understanding of the unspeakable gift of service and its expression in love for one another. There has been a diligent effort by the individual good-will, the publisher and each company to so serve for the advancement of the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Another joyful year has ended for our brethren in Panama. Here again we have seen wonderful increases in number of publishers. The average number in the field every month advanced 28 percent. Back-calls and book studies are far ahead of last year. Jehovah’s witnesses in Panama have really gone out of their way to help their brethren. Along with some interesting experiences, the Branch servant tells us of a trip to Bocas del Toro. When some of Jehovah’s witnesses and some of their people of good-will cannot come to you, then the thing to do is go to them so as to bring them comfort and help. This is just what was done in Panama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While at present there are only a few publishers out in the interior of Panama, yet the truth Is being carried out to many parts by persons with whom studies are being held in Panama city. These go into the interior for vacations and quite often take along the Kingdom message and preach it among friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One outstanding case is that of a lady who teaches school in an interior town, and who spends her vacations in Panama city. During one of such vacations she began studying with one of the Gilead graduates. In Panama religion must be taught in the schools; so when this lady went back to her school, instead of spending the required four hours a week teaching religion, she spends it teaching the truth, using the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font6"> During vacations she resumes her own study in Panama city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another lady took a large bag of literature with her on her vacation to the interior. These she placed from door to door, explaining as best she could, and promising to return in a few months to help them get more understanding after she herself had studied more and was better equipped to help them. She explained how she was studying and how she would help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The district assembly was the outstanding event of the year. It was held at Bocas del Toro, a small town located on an island just off the coast of Panama on the Atlantic side, and about 250 miles up the coast from Coldn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First we would need a suitable boat, and after weeks of searching one was chartered. It could carry 100 passengers in the rough. This meant no bunks, only the open deck to sleep on, and very limited sanitary facilities. We decided to take our own food supplies, as it would be practically impossible to get food for 100 persons in the small town of Bocas del Toro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were to leave from Colon at 3 p.m. on Thursday. Early that morning the Branch servant and another brother went on over to Coldn to help take care of last-minute details and get the boat loaded. The boat had gone out on a trip and was due back that day; however, time passed and she did not appear in port and no word was received as to her whereabouts, so it was decided to try to get another one even though they knew it would be practically hopeless, as every possibility had been exhausted in the effort to get this one. Nevertheless, our brethren refused to admit defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was now about 11 a.m. and we were scheduled to leave at 3 p.m., but, with the situation so hopeless, our brethren in Colon decided to call Panama city and tell the crowd from there not to come (they were scheduled to leave there on chartered buses at 12 noon). But first they decided to go back to see the owner of another boat that runs regularly to Bocas. This took them back to the dock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While standing around there waiting for the man, one of the group spied a relative and went over to talk to him. Naturally, the first thing he told him was of the dilemma we were in. Only the Lord could have had him there at that moment. He was a captain, the captain of the &quot;Amelia”! the very boat they had just heard about but were told her crew could not be found. The brother ran quickly to inform the others that he had found the captain of the “Amelia”, that she was free and in condition to make the trip. You may be sure they lost no time in getting to the owner and making a contract for the boat, while the captain went out to round up his crew; and at 2:15 p.m. the “Amelia” pulled up to the dock, and by 4: 30 everything, Including food for three days, and benches and chairs from the Kingdom Hall in Colon, was loaded on and we were on our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All were in high spirits, and spent the evening discussing the events of the day. As night settled down mattresses were put down and the entire deck was covered with sleepers. Few chose to sleep in the bunks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we arrived at Bocas del Toro, at about 2: 30 the next afternoon, the servant to the brethren met us and announced that the contract for the hotel had been canceled. This meant that we had no hall for our assembly. However, the Lord’s arm was not shortened, and He provided us with a much better place. Although it had no benches or chairs, this made no difference, as we had brought our own, and these were quickly transferred from the boat to the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the people of Bocas del Toro this was a strange assembly of people. When we first arrived they became excited and police came to the boat to see what it was all about. After three days spent among them, they were surprised to see us leave as quietly as we had come, and they expressed the hope that we would come again and spend a week or more. They were amazed to see the unity among us, and the complete lack of any distinction made between colored and white; and to see how we all ate and worked and lived together on the boat. There had been other conventions held there, but never one as quiet and orderly as this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunday night at sunset we left the dock. Out over the still waters that surround the island of Bocas del Toro, we glided. Out past the many smaller islands, into the open sea. All were tired, but, oh so filled with joy that passes all understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we enter the new year of service we look confidently to Jehovah to guide and direct us to his own name’s honor and glory. By his grace, we are now better organized and equipped to feed the “other sheep”, and to take care of the Increase. As this is being written plans are going forward for the organizing of a Spanish unit in Colon. This is another step forward, and we look for a steady increase in Spanish publishers there, as well as in other parts of the republic.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In South America there is a small inland country called Paraguay. Among its inhabitants of one and a half million people are various tribes of Indians, some savage, some friendly. Europeans have also settled this territory, and there is quite a mixture of languages and people. The truth has fallen on hearing ears in this land, and it has been preached in season and out of season. You often read of revolutions in South American countries, and Paraguay is one of the countries that has had its share. Jehovah’s witnesses take no part in these upheavals, but go right ahead with their principal and only work, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. The Kingdom is the only hope for the world, and the people of Paraguay must know this the same as any other race. The Branch servant gives us an interesting report of some of the difficulties they faced during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many obstacles had to be overcome, and one of the greatest ones in this country is fear. The people fear the clergy, fear the police, fear the government, and fear their neighbors. At the least sign of trouble, they are afraid to leave their homes, even if it costs them the loss of several days’ work. Only by the Lord’s grace, the “other sheep” are being fed and are gaining a knowledge of the truth, which leads to strength in overcoming their greatest enemy, fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another obstacle is the many different languages. Paraguay has been a place of refuge, and many fled from Europe and other parts of the world during the war years and have sought refuge in Paraguay. There are German, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and other nationalities. This is true also among the brethren. The people that live in the larger cities generally speak Spanish ; but the Paraguayans that live in the country speak their native language, Guarani, and very few of them can speak Spanish. Thus it has been hard to get the Kingdom message to many of these people because we do not have literature in Guarani. We have been able to get a few Bibles in their language, and that has helped some. But the Lord’s arm is not shortened because of language barriers, and he has raised up witnesses among this people who are now preaching the Kingdom message in their native tongue. Thus the people are given an opportunity to hear, and to sing praises to the great God of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This assembly was not held without the opposition of the enemy. An auditorium had been promised us free, but was later denied us because of religious prejudice, and it could not be had, with or without money. Every auditorium, schoolhouse and other building was solicited, but all were refused, many admitting it was because they were afraid of what the priest and his crowd would do. But Jehovah’s witnesses don’t give up. Putting our trust in Him, we continued to seek for a suitable place. We thought of having it in an open lot or field, but since the last revolution all meetings in the open have been forbidden. Only a month remained until the time scheduled for the convention, and no place to have it! Should it be canceled? The answer came, No! The owner of the earth and all things therein provided a place. Before the revolution Jehovah’s witnesses were housed in a spacious house with a large yard, just across the street from the army headquarters, the Estado Mayor. During the revolution the army, using the revolution as an excuse, insisted on having this place for military purposes, and Jehovah’s witnesses were required to find another house. But now Jehovah God had made it possible for another great witness to be given from this very place. The army had moved out, the house had been newly painted, and the place in general had been cleaned. The owner of the place was solicited and he gladly rented it to us for our three-day assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This house not only furnished a place for the assembly, but also a place to live for the brethren who came from various parts of the country, during their stay in the city. Beds were provided, a cafeteria set up and other things done which were necessary to make the brethren comfortable. Thus the great obstacle of finding a suitable place for the assembly was overcome; but the great opposer of Jehovah God, Satan the Devil, tried once more to frustrate our plans. The assembly was scheduled for the fourth, fifth, and sixth of June. Some of the brethren arrived on the second of June. On the third of June, one day before our convention, the Paraguayan army moved in to the city and overthrew the government, taking the president and his cabinet members prisoners. Although this overthrow of the government was without the shedding of blood, it caused a great stir in the city, and many of the businessmen of the city told us that it would be impossible to have our assembly. But this place that the Lord had prepared for us was not in the center of the city, the place of great confusion, and we were not molested. Thus again the Lord manifested his power, the convention being held as scheduled. A great witness was given and the brethren received a great blessing. Five brethren symbolized their consecration by immersion. Seven entered the service for the first time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Like a cluster of emeralds on the eastern extremity of the South China Sea lies one of the world’s youngest republics. The Philippine Republic has a democratic form of government. It is here that the East and the West have met. The faithful servants of the Lord have gone forward industriously in this land, spreading the good news of God’s kingdom. Education is a necessary thing in this territory, as there is much illiteracy; but even the people of little education have ears to hear, and it is a joy to bring them the truth. A large number of Jehovah’s witnesses are in position to teach others to read and write, but even before they learned this those having a clear conception of God’s kingdom were able to carry the good news to all parts of these lovely islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increase during the year has been excellent. On the average we find 45 percent more publishers in the field than the previous year, with a new peak of 4,073. Excellent work has been done in making back-calls on the people, encouraging Bible studies. Public meetings have played a big part on these many islands. The Branch servant in the Philippines sends in an interesting report from the new Branch office which the Society recently purchased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the Society purchased a fine, strong building in San Francisco del Monte, a suburb of Quezon City, and this is now serving as the new Branch home and office for the Philippines. The new premises are spacious and allow for the expansion of the work in the office and shipping departments so that these might keep up with the expansion of the work in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This expansion of true worship has been greatly aided by the translations of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> which now appear semimonthly in the Tagalog, Ilocano and Hiligaynon-Visa-yan dialects. The translating is done by brethren living in the areas where these dialects are spoken, and the manuscripts are sent in to the office to be mimeographed and mailed to the subscribers. At present our subscribers for the dialect </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> total 1,258.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers in the field have much appreciated the dialect translations of four of the Society’s booklets which were published during the past year. The need for more translations is urgent. Another boon to the publishers is the increased supply of Bibles in nearly all the leading dialects. Previous lack of these had been a severe handicap in the holding of home book studies because neither the publishers nor the people were equipped with a Bible to look up Scripture references.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was necessary during the past year for Jehovah’s witnesses to defend in court their right to use public property in carrying out their God-given commission to preach the gospel. As a result of the Theocratic assembly in the Sison auditorium, in Lingayen, Pangasinan, during November of 1945, a number of brethren had been charged with serious disobedience to the order of a person in authority. The person In authority was the acting governor of the province of Pangasinan, who wanted Jehovah’s witnesses to get out of the auditorium before the assembly was even well under way. One of the reasons given was that the brethren had violated the provisions of section 13, subsection 3, Article VI, of the Constitution of the Philippines, which reads as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, or used, directly or Indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sectarian institution, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or dignitary as such, except when such priest, preacher, minister, or dignl-tary is assigned to the armed forces or to any penal institution, orphanage, or leprosarium.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the case was taken to the court of appeals, the learned justices did not agree with the acting governor. They decided that the use of the Sison auditorium or any other public building by Jehovah’s witnesses did not violate the constitution. An interesting quotation from the court’s decision is here given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thus, for instance, early In 1937, a big portion of the Luneta, In the City of Manila, which is public property, was laid aside and used for several days in connection with an Eucharistic Congress held under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. Only recently, religious ceremonies w’ere held in another public property, the Rizal Stadium, in the same city, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ordination of the archbishop of Manila as priest of the same church. Religious processions are held daily, with the permission of the authorities, In public streets and highways, throughout the Philippines, and yet it has never been even suggested that such use of public property infringed the provisions of our organic laws implementing the principle of separation of the Church and the State.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the second circuit assembly in Naga, Camarines Sur, the vice-mayor and an aide, both carrying guns in hipholsters, stamped up on the platform of the theater just as the Theocratic Ministry course was under way. Addressing himself to the district servant, the vice-mayor roared, “Who gave you a permit to hold a meeting here?” The district servant replied, “This is a lawful Christian assembly on private property. No permit is needed for such an assembly. You may now leave and come back when the assembly is over.” The vice-mayor was so surprised by the prompt reply that he wheeled around and departed with his aide to the town plaza. There he worked off his anger by breaking up an outdoor religious gathering at gun-point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our hearts rejoice as we look back and see so much expansion in this country during the past year. It has been a real privilege to serve here and to share in so many grand experiences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Steady advances have been made in Poland in the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses there have many obstacles to overcome, but, by the Lord’s grace, they are determined to preach. It is quite evident that there are still many thousands of persons of good-will, for there has been an increase from 6,334 publishers in 1947 to 9,048 servants of the Lord in 1948. This is an increase of 42 percent. The Roman Catholic hierarchy in Poland is greatly distressed because of the progress made by Jehovah’s witnesses in bringing the truth to the people and in exposing the Catholic traditions that have been fed to the people for all these centuries. The Branch servant’s report on the progress of the work in Poland is very interesting, and we will let him tell of the difficulties they face while they preach the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are thankful to Jehovah God for the increase he gave us. The average number of publishers during the past year increased from 6,334 to 9,048. This increase is especially rejoicing due to the fact that the brethren in many sections of the country had to fight against great difficulties. For example, especially in the Stettin palatinate, the authorities influenced by the clergy carried on investigations in the homes of our brethren, taking the Bible and Bible publications away from them. These were not returned to them, in spite of the fact that they were taken contrary to the prevailing laws of the country which grant equal rights to all creeds or confessions. In the territory of the Olsztyn palatinate the authorities under the same influence proscribed the meetings of our brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prior to the district assembly, the clergy circulated false rumors to their parishioners against Jehovah’s witnesses, stating that they were gathering in great numbers in the city for the purpose of tearing down the Catholic churches. The dark masses believed this and stood in defense of their faith and their churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are cases where the militia does not fulfill its duties even though freedom and equal rights for all faiths exist. In such parts our brethren experience greater difficulties. The following incidents are examples as to how countries abroad are, by Catholic sources, so misinformed that it is believed Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland are specially being defended by communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the finish of last circuit assembly in Piotrkow Trybu-nalski, a town not far from Lodz, a beastly mob threw themselves upon our brethren as they were leaving the assembly hall. Two of our Gilead brethren were severely beaten. (This matter was reported to the American Embassy in Warsaw.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to the great influence the Roman Catholic clergy have upon the state authorities, this can be easily seen in the fact that these authorities at first give permission to Jehovah’s witnesses for holding the public talks and later under pressure try to intimidate the hall owners so that they would not allow their halls to be used for such purposes. This often occurs at our circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On August 27-29 at the circuit assembly the president of the city informed our brethren that the assembly could not be held because the hall was needed for a conference of the members of the communist and socialist parties. He requested the brethren to hold their assembly somewhere else, since he as the president of the city himself had signed for the hiring of the hall. However, our brethren did not accept this statement. So, on the following day, two hours before the assembly began, the president of the city sent our brethren an official letter stating that the assembly was proscribed and was subject to being called off. The brethren did not accept this letter and continued on with the preparations, with the program just about to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With only a few minutes left till the start of the assembly, seven military policemen came into the hall and walked up to the stage to talk to the brethren conducting the assembly. They ordered them to accept the official letter which proscribed the assembly and called for its immediate dissolution. After a long, loud and ineffective discussion on the stage the commander cried out: “In the name of the Republic of Poland, I call off this assembly. The representative of this assembly is hereby arrested and is coming with me!” Our brother declared that he was not going with him unless he was carried away from the place because the assembly was arranged on the basis of a written permit from the authorities of public safety. In spite of being repeatedly called to go with the commander, the brother refused to budge, repeating he could only be carried away. Then after a further discussion between the representatives of the old and the new world, a representative from the bureau of public safety called the commander to one side. The commander then quickly went to the town and after a few minutes returned saying that the president of the city permitted the holding of the assembly for that day, but that the sessions for the following two days would be canceled because the assembly was proscribed. The joy and thankfulness on the part of our brethren was then very great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second day eight military policemen came to the hall with the statement that the holding of the assembly was prohibited, and that everybody should leave the hall immediately. In spite of increasing shouts from the military policemen nobody budged from his place. The faces of the brethren each gave the appearance that he was not going to leave the hall voluntarily but only by being carried therefrom. The military police then closed the hall and stated that all were under arrest and that no one would be let out. The brethren coming to the assembly were not permitted to enter the hall. When some of the brethren from the inside asked to be let out so as to discuss the matter with the president of the city, the police showed great arrogance in this regard, being sure that a heavy penalty would be imposed upon our brethren for not fulfilling the official order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After a certain time the assistant military commander and his under officers came to the hall and cried out: “Where is the representative of the assembly?” When our brother appeared he was told: “You may now peacefully hold your assembly. We give you the permission and all formalities have been settled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of all difficulties, everything contributed to the fact that our blessings were far greater than we expected at the beginning of the year. Although at the beginning we established a quota for 9,000 publishers for the year, we soon surpassed this number. At present we have 27 circuits and there have been so many new companies set up in these circuits that in a short time now we expect to open up nine new circuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The progress of the Theocratic work in the country gives the publishers much occasion for gladness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The report for the year shows that the song of praise to Jehovah has increased considerably in volume in Puerto Rico, a beautiful island in the Caribbean sea. The chorus of singers has been enlarged by a goodly number of islanders; in fact, the average number of publishers increased from 87 to 160, an 82-percent increase. Even though this splendid advance was made, relatively few of the two and a quarter million persons living on this little island have hearkened to the melody of the Kingdom message. The ministers of the gospel feel their responsibility to continue with the proclamation during the coming year so that more people of good-will may hear and take their stand. As in all other parts of the world, the publishers have their problems and difficulties and their joys of service. They are determined to sing the praises of the Lord “more and more” and continue in this grand expansion work. The Branch servant tells us some of the things that have happened during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our two circuit assemblies provided the bright spots in our year’s activity. The first was held In San Juan, on the north coast, during the last week of Brother Steelman’s visit, and from the start a new spirit and greater enthusiasm were clearly manifest. 184 publishers reporting made it a peak month. Ponce, on the south coast, was selected for the second assembly, and we watched the results with interest, as it was our first attempt at a large assembly away from San Juan. It proved yet more joyful than the first, and brethren from eight different cities and towns assembled together. Here they had their first real taste of the way assemblies are arranged in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public meeting activity expanded during the year and 82 lectures were presented. Year-round summer weather enabled us to sing Jehovah’s praises in the open air, and wherever possible we made use of the public plazas. Surprising results have been attained, as in San Juan, where the lectures presented in the main plaza drew attendances of over 200 throughout the series, and in Ponce, where 350 persons listened to the first talk given there. We have put on over 40 open-air meetings and only once had to transfer to a hall because of rain. This occurred up In the little mountain town of Aibonito, where, though the population is only about 5,000, the attendance regularly was over 100. The night it rained 90 braved the elements to come to the hall obtained. This response has definitely not pleased the religionists and on two occasions the local hierarchy has printed and distributed pamphlets bearing the title of the talk to be given that day, “Which Is the True Church?”, which had the natural result of stirring up the people’s curiosity still more to hear </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the big factors in our increase in number of publishers has been the rapid growth of the Ponce company which was just formed at the beginning of the service year. During its first eleven months it has averaged 35 publishers and twice reached peaks of 44. The Gileadites there have had many interesting experiences. One of them while going from door to door contacted a person of good-will who had read and liked the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font6"> book. A </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth”</span><span class="font6"> book was placed with him and an invitation left to attend the public lecture. He came, and afterward asked the publisher to visit him at his home. After a few studies some books were left with him to distribute, and on calling back one week later the publisher was pleasantly surprised to find that the man and his wife had spent six hours going from house to house, all on their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We now have small groups of publishers reporting from the towns of Bayamon, Lares, and Utuado. Two of the groups have been visited by the servant to the brethren and we hope to form companies in all three places within the next few months. Additionally there are two special pioneers working in the town of Aibonito. And from the requests for literature sent in and cards received as a result of the radio programs we have evidence that there are interested persons scattered throughout the whole island. The seed sown by pioneers in years gone by is evidently beginning to germinate. We hope to soon have sufficient workers to be able to give these persons the attention they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another year has swiftly gone by and we look forward with keen interest to the next, wondering what it will hold in the way of Theocratic advancement and sure that many rich blessings await us for faithful continuance in the Kingdom announcement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is only by the grace of Jehovah that his witnesses are able to keep going in Rumania. Since February, 1948, it has been impossible for our brethren there to print anything so that the truth could be spread throughout the land. Only six issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> were printed during the year, and now the proclamation of the Kingdom has been halted by violence. Many of the brethren are in concentration camps, while others have been sentenced to serve prison terms. Jehovah’s witnesses during the Nazi regime were called Communists; now the Communist regime calls them Imperialists. It is interesting to see, though, how the religionists jump from one side of the government to the other. As far as they are concerned, any power can be the higher power, just as long as they keep their job. The religionists continue to carry on their hypocritical practices of pleasing men, not Jehovah. This is one thing that Jehovah’s witnesses have not done and will not do, by the Lord’s grace. Even lawyers who have defended Jehovah’s witnesses in the courts have been arrested, put through a court hearing, condemned and sentenced to eight months in prison. There are still some men with principles who are fearless and stand up for righteousness in Rumania, but they are gradually being beaten down. One lawyer, because of vigorous action, was able to keep 100 of our brethren from going to prison, but his prospects for future activity as a lawyer are not very promising under the present regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A report has come through for Rumania which was written by someone in that country. You will see from the report that conditions are difficult. The Society still has a Branch office and an organization and is able to keep in touch with the brethren. They are still proclaiming the Kingdom message, whether in prison, in concentration camps, or free to go about the city and country like other citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s work in this country has met with many obstacles during the course of the past service year. At the end of the former service year we lost all our money in connection with the currency reform; so we started the new year with nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the persecutions began, caused by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy together with other religionists who have been taught by their father the iJevil how to practice hypocrisy and lying. Under Fascist rule Christians in this country were persecuted and imprisoned as communists for ten years. The religionists quickly changed their coat in order to show themselves hypocritically in agreement with the masters of the day; but as the wolf changes its coat but not its habits, so the religionists of the day. They have always been hypocrites, the same as they were in Jesus’ day. They now attack Jehovah’s witnesses in denouncing them as reactionaries, imperialists and American propagandists, and that they are supported with dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many serious-minded people recognize that the accusations brought against these Christians in the past were not founded. They know that those Christians were imprisoned with the communists at that time, and that the latter now help the clergy to persecute the Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These Christian ministers give testimony also in prison. In the past they served their prison sentences with people of the poorer classes, that is to say, with communists; but now just the contrary is the case, for now they find themselves together with those who a short time ago were their persecutors. They have naturally had many Interesting experiences in connection with such fellow prisoners. For instance, there is a professor of theology who is in prison for political reasons (before, candidates for the priesthood were examined by him). A discussion began about Biblical questions between this professor and some imprisoned Jehovah’s witnesses, which discussion was listened to by fellow prisoners, namely, high officers and officials. One of these prisoners, a general, who had followed the discussion right to its close, then asked the professor of theology what he had been teaching for so many years, seeing that a Christian, who was but a simple craftsman, had more knowledge of the Bible than he himself. The professor answered that he and his fellow theologians had been taught religious traditions and taught such themselves. Then the general stated in the presence of all his fellow prisoners: “We trusted in your science but now we recognize that we have been woefully misled.” Another interesting case: A number of prisoners were freed together, whereby the Christians were asked to stand apart from the others. It was found that there were more of them than when they had entered the prison. The reason was that the additional Christians stated publicly that henceforth they wanted to belong to this class of people, and that for this reason they lined themselves up with them. A prisoner in another penitentiary sent us “Good Hopes” out of prison several times. We learned that he had been sentenced to a total of 75 years for a number of robberies. In the prison he heard about the truth, accepted it, and has since manifested such exemplary conduct that he is commissioned to go into town all alone to purchase things for the prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As was seen from our monthly service reports at the beginning of the service year, the pioneer work increased wonderfully. These dear brethren were helped very much by the gift of food which arrived just at the right time. This was a most welcome surprise, and these parcels were delivered by the CARE organization to our home. We were very grateful to our brethren in America for thus thinking of those who were in need here. This was a great help for the furtherance of the work. We could say much about this, but now the one who says some good about such action even risks to be condemned because of it, and so may it suffice to just briefly express our thanks here and our deep gratitude to Jehovah God, the great Giver, and to his dear Son, Jesus Christ, who knew what we needed and who caused the hearts of generous givers to think of us at the proper time. We thank Brother Knorr and all the dear brethren for this gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The one who distributed these food parcels to the hungry ones was thrown into prison for one month and accused of having made propaganda for America. In the flat of a widow who has several children there was found an empty tin which had contained American conserves. This sufficed to have this widow locked up for three months. In yet another case a lawyer was arrested in the midst of a trial and sentenced to prison because he defended a company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much less could be done during the past year than in the preceding one; this because of the many serious obstacles we have met. Public lectures were given only In the first half of the year. During the second half of the service year, not even our brethren were able to meet. Work from house to house was impossible. Literature with Biblical contents cannot be published any more. Yet you will have noticed from the annual field service report that back-calls and book studies have Increased, and that the number of publishers has also Improved toward the end of the year. We shall continue to do our best, by the Lord’s grace, under his protection and guidance. Peace and unity have reigned among God’s people in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is very difficult to get any information out of Russia. Those in authority guard their borders and do not let anything come out that they do not want to come out. It is a nation with a totalitarian rule, and the people must submit to those who are in authority or suffer the consequences. To be one of Jehovah’s witnesses and live in Russia means that his integrity will be tested to the limit. In many instances one must go as far as to give up his life for his principles rather than submit to the wish of the dictator. It is a person’s conscience against devilish world rule. Jehovah’s witnesses in Russia know, as do all God’s servants, that there will be a resurrection of the dead; and having faith in that, they are not afraid to die. Hundreds of them have been persecuted and tormented in the work camps where they have been sent just because they have made mention of the name Jehovah and preached God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preaching of a kingdom different from Soviet rule is entirely out of order in Russia. There is only one rule for the world there, and that is Soviet, say they. Little do they know that Jehovah’s kingdom will rule this world in righteousness. Jehovah’s witnesses have firm faith in this because God’s Word, which is true, states it. In communications that have reached America from some of Jehovah’s witnesses living in Russia, they have pointed out that the love of the publishers for Theocratic work is marvelous. Sometimes the persecution that is brought upon Jehovah’s witnesses has acted as a boomerang to the government itself, because after many years of suffering by the brethren in Siberia and other places where work camps have been set up some of the officials have listened to the truth and taken their stand. Of course, this means then that the officials lose their position and are classed with Jehovah’s witnesses, receiving similar persecution. God’s servants are not afraid of the penal camps or prisons or even death amid hunger and cold. These faithful ministers of the gospel face these conditions fearlessly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Letters continually circulate throughout Russia among our brethren concerning their condition and joy of serving. By God’s grace they are determined to serve. Last year the Society reported 3,498 publishers in Russia. This year it has been more difficult to get a very accurate report, but we feel certain from communications received that there are at least 8,000 serving Kingdom interests in that land. The message is going out and the people are hearing despite the religious and political opposition. It would be unwise to state where the reports come from, but additional information on activity in Russia will be of interest to all readers of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hundreds of our brethren have been thrown into penal work camps in the whole country and especially in faraway Siberia. They are suffering from hunger and want in every respect and many of them have paid with their lives in faithfulness to Jehovah God. Those who remained alive rejoice in the Lord, and Jehovah is their strength and joy. They are not silent about the loving purposes of Jehovah God and they praise his name in every place and at every time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In many cases the mentioning of the name “Jehovah” is sufficient cause for a man to be charged as a “Jehovlst” and have his freedom taken away. It is also sufficient cause for carrying on a thorough investigation in the man’s home in the search for some kind of publication or leaflet of “Jehovah’s witnesses” in an effort to prove that he belongs to the “Jehovists” and thus sentence him to 10 years of hard work in penal camps with all of his property being confiscated. Because the Lord’s people do not hide their faith or stop from mentioning the name of Almighty God, the opposers have an easy job in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our brethren in the western Ukraine suffer the greatest persecution. They live in territory obtained from Poland, in large closely united groups. The Greek Catholic clergy are the ones that mainly persecute the brethren in this territory. They formerly propagated a nationalistic tendency and co-worked with Hitler, but at the present they consider Jehovah’s witnesses as their greatest enemies because they do not support nationalistic bands which even today are still a danger in those parts striving for complete nationalistic autonomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our brethren are experiencing greater difficulties in their work because they are not permitted to have any legal defense. In the courts all the cases are settled automatically on the basis of the general attitude formed against Jehovah’s witnesses, and because of this very little is taken into consideration as to what is said there. Lawyers are fearful to coine forth in defense of religious freedom because in that country no one knows that such freedom exists according to the letter of the law. If someone tries to call attention to these legal ordinances, then the lawyers declare that these ordinances exist only for other countries but “here in this country the street rules”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When our brethren proceeded to prepare a delegation to the central government in Moscow for the purpose of submitting a petition in defense of their faith, the lawyers who appeared to be interested in helping the brethren to carry out this action hypocritically and secretly betrayed the whole matter to the authorities of the GKHB (formerly G.P.U.). The delegation was arrested before presenting the matter to the authorities. Because this matter was presented several times, this way they caught the most capable brethren who conducted the work in different sections of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the correspondence that reached our hands from Russia, it appears there are over 8,000 active publishers in the territory of all Russia: namely, 4,000 in the territory of the west Ukraine, close to 2,000 in Moldavia, over 2,000 in the territory of deep Russia, in Siberia and Kazakstan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">mainly in compulsory work camps, several hundred in Carpathian Russian territory, over 100 in Lithuania, and besides this some small companies in White Russia, in Estonia and in remaining western republics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This data embraces only the companies who have contact with one another. Due to the great persecution, not all of the companies managed to make and keep contact with one another. For example, only in this year did more than 40 companies from Carpathian Russia make contact with Jehovah God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s people concentrated together in the territory of west Ukraine work the most intensively, and because of this the Theocratic work there is making good progress despite the strongest rage of persecution there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Their organization is well conducted and conforms to the existing conditions. The faith and integrity in action as shown by our brethren there causes the people of goodwill to become followers of the New World, not only on the basis of what they hear, but mainly because of what they see and admire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Latvia say that they must secretly carry on their worship of Jehovah. “In uncertainty we witness to the people of good-will as we serve the Most High God.” They are able to tell their fellow men of Jehovah’s wonderful work and his purpose and kingdom and its blessings. “Our hands, however, are nearly empty of divine implements. The little we possess we can only loan out, and this is very little. We are very grateful for the spiritual food that we receive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was back in 1934 that the Latvian dictator Ulmanis seized the power over that country, and Jehovah’s witnesses of Riga were immediately forbidden to meet and their organization was dissolved. From that time to this, through the Nazi invasion and since the Russians have taken over, the faithful servants of God have continued to promote true worship. Jehovah’s witnesses are still organized and devoted to divine service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>SIAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The 18 million people who live in Siam need to have the truth brought to them the same as it is brought to the people of any other kindred or tongue. While millions of people in Asia are starving, the Siamese have plenty and are exporting vast quantities of riee. The problem there is not food. The Scripture tells us, however, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proeeedeth out of the mouth of God.” It is essential, therefore, to continue to carry the good message of the Kingdom to all parts of Siam. This message began to penetrate the country early in 1937 and has continued to shine ever since. While the second world war interfered to some extent with the spreading of the truth, it never brought it to a full stop. Today graduates from Gilead, along with the publishers in Siam, are pressing on, doing what they can to advance true worship in that religious land. The Branch servant gives us some interesting sidelights on what the publishers have to contend with. To the Siamese it is normal life, but to European eyes the mode of living is different and strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One difficulty is that publications in Siamese have always been rather scant; so, much explanation is needed to educate the friends. Early in the service year a servant to the brethren was sent to north Siam, and improvement has been noted in several ways. For one thing, the brethren have learned the importance of reporting. Previously much work was done but not reported, and this improvement in reporting has accounted for an increase from the company publishers. Four companies have been organized in that part of the country and the servant to the brethren has been able to pay them several visits to help them observe the new methods of carrying on the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A further impetus to the work was given in April, 1948, when a number of brethren from Bangkok, including several from the Branch office, made the long trip to Chiengmai to Siam’s first circuit assembly, which proved highly interesting and educational to the friends, who came from many towns and villages around Chiengmai. None of the brethren had attended a Theocratic Ministry school before; so this event on Friday night, April 16, was something new to them, and they keenly enjoyed the Bible information given out. It caused hours of discussion among them far into the night, and now and again they would sing Kingdom songs in Siamese which one of the brethren had translated. Next day we introduced the magazine bags, and it was encouraging to see how quickly the brethren recovered from their surprise at this new feature of the work. They came out with us and stood boldly on the streets offering leaflets and magazines. We also had the joyful experience of a baptismal service on Sunday morning, when a busload of us went out to a quiet mountain stream and 16 were immersed. Follow-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ing this we had a public lecture in the afternoon, with an attendance of 206.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we might mention that traveling in Siam possesses characteristics all its own. On the trip from Bangkok by train, two of us had to stand all night on the platform because there wasn’t a square inch of sitting space left; not only that, but the corridors were full of bags and baskets, some of which had ducks and fowls in them, and people were squatting on these too. As the train got farther north we were sprayed with water at each station, as it was the time of the water-throwing festival, which the Siamese greatly enjoy. Traveling in the country districts is by bus in the dry season; these too, we found, were always packed with people and livestock. Or sometimes we would all have to get out while a load of rice was taken on, then we had to climb in as best we could and make the most of it. This is travel de luxe, though; for in the wet season many of the roads are too bad for buses; then you have to use the latest 1948 bullock cart, or else walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here in Bangkok the public meeting work has been in progress since March, and it has served greatly to advertise the Kingdom message. Advertising has been done by means of sound-car announcements as well as by leaflet distribution on the streets. On the horn of the sound-car is written in Siamese “Announcing the New World”, and this has done much toward familiarizing the people with the message of the New W’orld. Lately we have been able to obtain the use of schools for public lectures. Several -weeks ago we were invited by the Buddhist Association to give a public lecture. It was very interesting and unusual to see the 125 Buddhist priests, attired in their yellow robes, lined up in orderly rows on chairs, and they listened attentively to the lecture on the authenticity of the Bible. Many made notes and one priest took down the whole lecture in shorthand. Afterward they asked a number of intelligent questions. Many of these priests are well educated and, unlike priests of the Catholic Hierarchy, they are tolerant, well-mannered and polite.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In the territory known as South Africa there are many different peoples, kindreds and tongues. By far the greatest number are native Africans. Europeans have moved into this territory, building cities and towns, and have taken over the commerce, religion and political rule of the nations and tribes that formerly existed there. This certainly is a field in which to carry on the true worship of God. It is a field in which continual advancement can be made, because after the natives learn the truth they can be taught to read and write so they can gain more knowledge through their own efforts by careful study of the Lord’s Word and by reading the publications furnished by the Society. The work to be done seems endless. What is true concerning South Africa is true of the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We know, however, that the time has come for this gospel of the Kingdom to be preached in all the world for a witness, and then the end will come. Jehovah’s witnesses in South Africa are, to the best of their ability and by the grace of God, preaching this gospel in the deepest parts of South Africa. Jehovah’s witnesses in this area of the earth can rejoice and be glad for the tremendous expansion that has taken place during the service year. Publishers have increased from 16,500 to 23,300. The total for the peak number of publishers in the reports for the seven countries which follow reached a little more than 27,000 for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This vast territory has been under the direction of the Branch servant and the office at Cape Town, South Africa. From this office come interesting reports on all the territory under its jurisdiction. With the aid of the local brethren in each country a very interesting report has been compiled for the South African territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has published the Kingdom message in all of the principal languages spoken in the Union, and thus it has been possible during the past year to sing praises to Jehovah among all of these nations. Literature in 26 languages was distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tour visit in January was the outstanding event during the past year. For many years we had looked forward to the day when the Society’s president would come to South Africa. When that day eventually came the joy of all the brethren in this land knew no bounds. This was demonstrated by the fact that, at comparatively short notice, they flocked from all parts of the Union to Johannesburg to attend the convention, January 3-5, which had been arranged to synchronize with your arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Needless to say it was the best-attended convention to date, with 3,600 brethren (2,500 African and 1,100 European ) present at the opening sessions. The peak was reached at the public meetings when 7,246 Africans and 2,000 Europeans acclaimed, with frequent bursts of applause, the speech on “Permanent Governor of All Nations”. This was easily the largest number ever to assemble in one town in this country to hear the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Cape Town brethren, especially those unable to travel to Johannesburg, were glad that the Branch office was located in this part of the country, for that meant they had the pleasure of a three-day visit after the convention was over with meetings each evening and a well-attended public meeting in the City Hall to wind up. There were approximately 250 friends and 700 members of the public present; an excellent result for a midsummer meeting. Instruction and counsel received by the office force was much appreciated, and we are indeed grateful for the arrangements made for us to have a Bethel home and factory which will be the property of the Society. This will meet a long-felt need and surely lead to still greater expansion of the work in the years to come. We look forward to the day when the building will be erected and ready for occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The African pioneers experience quite a bit of trouble witnessing in mine compounds, w’hich are usually private property belonging to the mine. However, sometimes the compound manager is a person of good-will, as indicated in the experience of one pioneer: “When the compound manager saw me at the street corner he sent the police to arrest me. He told me I had no right to sell books in the compound without permission, as they were his people. I gave him Isaiah 42: 8 and told him that Jehovah was the Creator of ail men and that now was the time when all creatures must know him and worship him. I gave him also Psalm 148: 7-13. lie said, ‘All right, do your duty.’ When he later heard I was holding a book study with people of good-will he gave us a room to study in. Now we have 12 attending the study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Apartment houses and flats have for long provided the problem of reaching the “not at homes”. This is now being successfully overcome by working them from 5 to 7 p.m. One pioneer states that these are the two best hours of the day to contact flat dwellers and he gladly adjusts his owm meal hours in order to get the message to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public meeting campaign has made rapid strides. The outlines were translated into the principal African languages and many of the African brethren have applied themselves with real diligence to the preparation and delivery of the talks. In those sections where no halls are available or where publishers are unable to pay rental meetings have been held in the open with excellent results. Usually the attendance has been far greater than at the hall meetings. Now we are arranging to hold series at group centers and in the homes of persons of good-will, and it is hoped that this will build up the group work, give us a better opportunity to quickly make friends with the new interest and increase the number of publishers of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren in this land welcomed the opportunity to show their unity and sympathy with their fellow servants who have suffered so much diabolical persecution in Greece. Letters of protest were sent from all parts of the country to the Greek legation. In his reply the minister said, “It has been fully ascertained that persecutions of Jehovah’s witnesses as those mentioned in the periodical </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> have never taken place in Greece and the writer of the article must no doubt be the victim of unfounded and calumnious reports of subversive elements,” and that “in Greece full religious tolerance prevails and the cathechism of any faith including that of Jehovah’s witnesses is freely allowed”. The minister is doubtless a worthy representative of the Greek Orthodox Church in addition to being a representative of the state, and his letter enables one to understand still more clearly why there is no freedom of assembly and why such persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is permitted in Greece 1</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For years the witness work has gone on in this Catholic-dominated territory under the greatest difficulties. In times past the priests sometimes even used to make a man eat a block of salt without water as a punishment for being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but now their methods are more in conformity with the Spanish Inquisition; they want the government to do their wicked oppressive work for them. For years African publishers have been in prison serving indeterminate sentences because of their witnessing work, and to make things worse they are sent to a special concentration camp at Kasaji, about 120 miles from Elizabethville. Here they labor on small plots, and suffer isolation with or without their families. They have no crime charged against them; often, indeed, they are brought before no magistrate. All that is necessary to conform to legal requirements is to have a statement from the SOretd signed by a provincial governor telling that the African is what they have been pleased to call “Citawala” and imprisonment or detention follow. The time may extend to even ten years. Often years and years of this seclusion are endured without the slightest hope of liberty or justice, except at the terrible price of selling their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The result has been that the work has been driven underground ; meetings are held in secret, and the centers have to be changed for fear of arrest. Much of the witnessing was done by calling upon known friendly persons and their friends, but even then trouble has fallen upon one and then another. The witness is arrested and rushed to the Kasaji camp. The government setup, urged on by the priests, who find their way continually into government offices, is a useful instrument for hindering the gospel message. The far-flung cry of the danger of Communism has been worked to its limits, and there is the added claim that so long as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font6"> (the priests) have the native in hand he is “safe”. It has been so arranged that education of the African is in the vernacular and thus, for the most part, they have them to themselves, because only very recently have secular schools been permitted in the Congo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Society’s president passed through the Congo on his way to the Johannesburg assembly last January the company servant of Elizabethville made the journey to Leopoldville to report to him. There detectives arrested him on the flimsy charge of being “Citawala” and he was kept in prison for a month, in an isolated cell, with just one meal a day. His explanations were of no avail; no charge was laid of wrong-doing and he appeared before no magistrate. The habeas corpus act does not apply in such cases in the Congo. After the end of the month the prisoner was brought through the waterways under escort to Elizabethville and there he was again imprisoned for weeks, but this time in a cell alone with a madman. Day after day the local chief of police would call him to try to make him condemn himself. Finally, he, with his wife and four other witnesses who had recently been arrested, were deported. Their crime: being witnesses of Jehovah! One of these brethren had served more than thirty years with a flrm and he thus lost his hard-earned pension and only escaped a long sentence because of the protests of the Society and the fact that he is a subject of Northern Rhodesia. Three arrested at almost the same time (one a woman) had all their clothes stripped off them and their personal belongings taken, and they are still at Kasaji camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year European brethren have come over from Belgium and they have witnessed at Jadotville and Elizabethville. The same chief of police who had troubled the Africans had a sister’s books confiscated and literature placed with the people collected. She was told to stop her work, unless . . . With the same boldness that had prompted her years before to throw the family crucifix into the river, to the horror of her husband, she told this religious policeman that she would not stop, and, anyway, she had heard that the food in the prison was quite good! She has continued witnessing, with joy in her heart.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Northern Rhodesia has made excellent progress during the past year. Your visit and that of Brother Henschel provided' a great impetus to the work in that country. Not only has the African work gone ahead by leaps and bounds but the provision of two Gilead graduates means that much needed attention is now being given to the European population and the fruits of their labors are already manifest in the two towns in which they have worked thus far. In one, a small European company organization has been strengthened; in the other, several who had some knowledge of the truth but were inactive are now sharing in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The education campaign stressed by the president during his visit is doing good work, but it is limited by the lack of capable teachers. Where the government has its “mass literacy” scheme in operation the brethren have availed themselves of it, but only in a few parts of the country is this the case; elsewhere it falls to the lot of those who know to help others, irrespective of the amount they know. Here and there are fully qualified teachers who are glad and willing to assist the local companies, but for the most part it means that those who can read and write, even falteringly, are helping their brethren, and these, in turn, when they have reached a certain standard, assist others. Some of the most devoted servants and publishers have, in times past, learned to read and write with the aid of very little instruction and the use of the Bible as the only textbook. At present there are approximately 1,300 brethren selected by the servants to the brethren to teach others, and for the most part there is satisfactory progress; but it is slow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During a circuit assembly of 2,800 publishers permission was granted for a European representative of the Society to address the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">khotla,</span><span class="font6"> the supreme Barotse ruling council, and so, from the throne, with the late paramount chief beside him, he was able for a short time to explain why our work is different and what our message is. All this in the presence of the chiefs, the stewards, that royal family, and, of course, the sacred royal drums. After this they were beaten with traditional vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One old member of the royal house, too aged to walk, used to ride daily to the fork of a native path and there he would call the people passing to witness to them. An enemy killed his donkey with a spear and he was sad indeed, but he has been given another by a publisher and he still does his work. His eyes are bright and the assembly meant much to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">aslcari</span><span class="font6"> who were sent to ‘watch’ that there were no troublemakers (and there were none except for a poor demented half-naked girl who rushed to the platform during a discourse) soon took up the spirit of Jehovah’s witnesses and before long they were enjoying the songs and mingling with the publishers with the kindly friendship winch is traditional of the African. Their lines had fallen in pleasant places. Even the pilot was astounded to see so many at the aerodrome to see the servant to the brethren leave, but the missionaries looked very glum at this manifestation of Theocratic increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Relatively the percentage of those Interested to the population is extremely high. In this country as many as five villages will be found to be almost exclusively made up of publishers and persons of good-will. The headman may be a publisher; he is not infrequently the company servant, and in such villages are to be seen the neat little Kingdom Halls as the center of activity. In such cases there are no tax collection problems for the government. Quite often the taxes are collected and handed the collecting official without the asking. Recently in the Solwezi district the chief called at the Kingdom Hall; he listened to the study and then asked how many had paid their taxes. Without exception all had. He then called in the tax offenders and compared them unfavorably with the brethren, and begged them to follow the good example that had been set. Moreover he urged the enlargement of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">September 1947 found us battling still for the lifting of the ban on the Society’s literature, and with the brethren patiently pushing on with the back-call work and with the public meeting campaign, having confidence that Jehovah in his due time would prepare the way for the Kingdom literature to be free to enter the country once again. Then came the gladsome news of Brother Knorr’s visit to be made in January of this year, and which precipitated us into two months of joyful preparation for the event with our dozen pioneers, assisted by the local company publishers, during the week-ends, working very zealously to get the assembly place Into usable condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visit has been reported elsewhere but it seemed to act as a key to the opening of still another chapter of Nyasaland Kingdom history in which the observer may behold spread before him a field ripe unto the harvest. The personal contact of the president with the brethren in this country and the full provision made to have the circuit brethren visiting the companies regularly has settled in their minds that the Society is sincerely interested in their welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gilead graduate who remained behind and who served as school instructor to the servants to the brethren during February gave these brethren some very useful and helpful instruction, the fruits of which are easily noticeable in their service. It would be fine to have this schooling become a yearly feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The field work done by our visiting Gilead graduate during the months of March and April among the European population caused him to become the “most-talked-about man in the country”! So effective was his effort that he was asked what the “big drive” was all about! He was well on the way to becoming a Nyasalander ere he left and we were all sorry to see him go to his new assignment in Northern Rhodesia, but we look forward very much to receiving In our midst the other four Gilead-trained brethren to help ‘desolate’ the land of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servants to the brethren are doing some really good work, and now up in the northern province where the brethren had been finding difficulty things are becoming easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At some company bases Jehovah’s witnesses have become so numerous that sufficient territory in which to witness is becoming quite a problem ! Many village headmen and chiefs are friendly toward Jehovah’s witnesses and often encourage their people to attend their studies and their meetings and to join in the witness work. Many chiefs who, at first, opposed Jehovah’s witnesses later on confessed that their opposition was fanned by misrepresentation brought to them by the religious leaders. Often they would be told that if they allowed Jehovah’s witnesses to operate in their villages the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">boma</span><span class="font6"> (government) would take away their chieftainship, or fine or Imprison them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Kingdom prospects in Mozambique continue to open up and now we have four full-time workers there helping along the people of good-will and encouraging them to learn to read. Many more pioneers are needed, and It Is hoped that some of the more mature brethren may manage to arrange their affairs to devote their time in full service to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingdom work in Portuguese East Africa is now being carried forward in about six different areas but there are, of course, still many hundreds of villages uncared for. Many of the people in their ignorance still worship sticks and stones and appease the spirits of the departed with gifts of beer, maize and other foodstuffs. They are still ignorant of Christendom and its multitudinous teachings; so the pioneers find themselves facing conditions very similar to those which the apostles faced in their day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Food shortages along the Zambezi river are already threatening the populace, and the brethren are spending more and more time foraging for edible herbs and roots in the forests and in hunting the wild animals for meat supplies. The scorching sun of the past summer and the overwhelming rains brought havoc to their season’s crops. However, the brethren know from whom these woes come and that it is for them to remain steadfast in service to Jehovah under all conditions. May Jehovah be their strength and their comfort always.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The population of St. Helena today numbers less than 5,000. However, there has been an average of 10 publishers throughout the year and, although handicapped by lack of transport and roads, they have made an effort to pass on the Kingdom message to their fellow islanders. Many of these have obtained literature in years gone by and have taken their stand in opposition to the truth. Here and there meek ones still give a hearing ear and it is hoped that some of these will yet take an open stand for The Theocracy and share with the witnesses in praising Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As indicated in the report for 1947 it was clear that one of the pressing needs to properly organize the work in that country was to provide additional instruction in their own tongue to African publishers. This meant that the staff had to be increased from one to three; two translators being needed for Cinyanja and Chishona, two of the three languages most widely used by Africans in Southern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Imagine the joyful and stimulating effect the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in their own tongue would have on our African brethren. The increase in all features of witnessing activities in Southern Rhodesia shows unmistakably how much the publishers appreciate these provisions of the Lord through his “faithful and wise servant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Additionally, we have had instructions to translate a booklet entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Story, The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> into Chishona. It is hoped to have the two booklets ready for distribution during 1948, but the bound book will not be In print until 1949. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Story</span><span class="font6"> Is a specially prepared publication designed to correct many false notions in some of these African countries about the Society, due to untrue reports and misleading claims and unlawful acts by some calling themselves “Watchtower”. This booklet is bound to have a good effect upon all honest-hearted persons and will also be effective in silencing those who try to blame the Watch Tower Society for all the industrial and other disturbances that occur from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unexpectedly the thrilling news came from Cape Town early in October, 1947, that certain preparations were to be made for the impending visit of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel. A few days later a definite date was given, and so the work of organizing assemblies at Bulawayo and Salisbury started. Programs were set out and sent off to Cape Town for printing. Many thousands of leaflets, hundreds of posters and a number of banners advertised the public lectures to be given by Brother Knorr to Africans and Europeans at Bulawayo and Salisbury. While this preparation was going on up comes some more news, this time about what we now like to call our ‘gift from Gilead’ in the person of Brother Eric Cooke, possibly to be assigned to Southern Rhodesia, and who would assist in the activities connected with the president’s visit. However, Eric would first attend the happiest, biggest and most thrilling assembly of Jehovah’s people ever to be held in Johannesburg, or anywhere else in Southern Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Final preparations for the coming assembly of African and European brethren from northeastern sections of Southern Rhodesia had now to be made. European friends who had attended the Johannesburg convention were also present at Salisbury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for the African brethren, sleeping and hall accommodation obstacles had to be overcome. On January 5, 1948, a letter was sent by the Native Administration Department, Salisbury Council, to the company servant, Salisbury-African Unit of Jehovah’s witnesses, forthwith canceling all arrangements previously made with the African Welfare Society for the use of the hall in the Hararl township during the convention period January 16-18, 1948. Another letter from the same source, dated January 9, replying now to this depot, which had taken up the matter with the Native Administration, “regretted that your Society should have gone to the expense in arranging for meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">on 16th, 17th and 18th instant . . . the matter remains as previously indicated . . .” In addition to this, we learned on arrival at Salisbury that sleeping accommodation also previously arranged for our African brethren had been swept aside just like that! So the position on Tuesday, January 13, was that there was no place available for the public lecture to be given by Brother Knorr to Africans, and no sleeping accommodation for thousands of conven-tioners. That selfsame day saw Brother Cooke interview the director of the Native Department to learn that the objection to letting us have the use of hall facilities was due to the Society’s being ‘against the government’, or words to that effect. Brother Cooke overcame this erroneous idea by reading the first paragraph of pages 13 to 21 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> of Jehovah’s witnesses. This impressed Mr. Bal-lenden to the extent of contributing for a copy of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font6"> arranging to let us have the use of the hall in Harari township for the occasion of the public talk by the Society’s president and making available sufficient sleeping accommodation for the thousands expected to attend the convention. Thus, by the Lord’s grace, the way was opened for a most successful assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses with a peak attendance of beyond the 6,000 mark. No hall anywhere in Southern Rhodesia eould accommodate such crowds, so the meetings were all open-air with loud-speaker facilities in operation, drawing the necessary electric power from the Harari hall in the case of the public lecture and from a Methodist church, with the kind consent of the African minister, for the rest of the convention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to shortage of dollars in sterling countries a permit had to be obtained from the Southern Rhodesia Department of Commerce and Industries to import all goods coming from specified countries, including America. So a consignment of literature inadvertently ordered after the new regulations came into effect was held up at Bulawayo some months before Brother Knorr’s visit. The secretary of commerce and industries was repeatedly written to and interviewed to obtain the release of the consignment held up at the railway station and to get permission to import other supplies, without effect. At the last interview with the secretary of the department it was unequivocally stated that there was no hope of either getting delivery of the publications at the station or obtaining a permit for other supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persistence had its reward, and in course an invitation came to see the secretary when next a representative of the Society was in Salisbury. As this occurred just previous to the pending arrival of the Society’s president, it was with a sense of great relief when instruction came from Cape Town to arrange for Brother Knorr to see Mr. Tobil-cock about the matter. Due to the fact that the program covering Brother Knorr’s visit was a very tight-fitting one an appointment was made for the meeting to be held little more than an hour before the visitor’s departure. A little bit of anxious delay at the last, but the appointment was kept, in a flash the whole matter was settled—literature from America would come as a free gift! In due course the consignment held up for months at the Bulawayo station, which had been taken by Customs to the King’s warehouse, was released. Further supplies have since come into the country. Imagine the rejoicing! The publishers here know what it means to be without these Bible helps in their work of witness, since the Society’s publications were banned throughout the war years, and this final act of Brother Knorr on behalf of his brethren, added to all the other good things he did for us, still warms us up and we look forward to another visit to push forward the work of expanding Kingdom activity in our land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In January, the African who had been dealing with the combined reports of the companies fell by the wayside, and a Cibemba-speaking servant to the brethren was sent from Northern Rhodesia to visit the congregations. Since then he has been working continuously in Tanganyika encouraging and building up the eight companies that are in the Mbeya district, while the only other company, which lies on the northern borders of Northern Rhodesia, has been contacted and helped by another servant to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To indicate that there is the same desire for the gospel message, and the same prospect of expansion here as elsewhere, two experiences of the servant to the brethren are quoted: “On June 15, with two fellow publishers I went to pay a back-call on the senior chief. We waited under a tree after making known the purpose of our visit and when the chief came he ordered his wives to clean up the place we would talk in, because, he said, we publishers had brought a message from our common Creator. About this time men came near by to discuss legal cases to be tried, but the chief would not be disturbed; rather, he called in his counselors and others who would attend the court, and there, before 54 listeners, a good testimony was given. To show his gratitude he supplied these witnesses with an abundance of fish and asked them to call again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another chief who visited a Bible study asked for texts to take away with him to look up himself. The next day a religionist informed him about a special meeting, to which he immediately replied: “No; I will not attend the meeting you mention. We have our own Bible studies in the village with Jehovah’s witnesses on that day.” Since then the chief has greatly increased his interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The people of the Far East mixed with Indians, Javanese and the Dutch make up the population of Surinam. All of these different kinds of people have their own forms of worship, and not only that, but they hold to their own language. This makes it difficult for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry the message of the Kingdom to people of so many languages in such a small area, but they do it just the same and with excellent success. The ministers in Surinam have made splendid progress during the year, advancing 41 percent in number of publishers. They averaged 78 publishers throughout the 1948 service year, reaching a peak of 102. They are determined to sing the praises of God “more and more” during the next service year. What they have been doing for the past twelve months is related by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 1948 public meeting campaign was begun in Fort Nieuw Amsterdam, a small town of about 400 inhabitants. There eight publishers took part in advertising the public lecture. An attendance of 76 came to the meeting representing five races: Indians, Chinese, Javanese, Creoles and whites. It was a thrill to see so many come to the public market to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gilead ministers have improved in speaking Holland-ish. One of the Gilead brothers is now giving public lectures in Hollandish by using an outline. After the Hol-landish-speaking people have been reached, there are still many more to preach to; because the Hindustani-speaking Indians and Javanese still speak their own native tongues which they brought from the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During April the servant to the brethren went to Nieuw Nickerie, a small seacoast town near British Guiana. While he was there he gave two public lectures in Hollandish, using an outline; but some in the audience said, “This man cannot be an American; he must be a Hollander.” That was the first time that the servant to the brethren gave a public talk using only an outline. Thirty-five attended the first public talk; but 65 attended the second public talk, which was held in a rice mill outside the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One evening while busily handing out handbills I was approached by a young lady, a steady churchgoer, but who had also been taking a Bible study with me. In the course of our conversation along came a group of British Indians. She stood by and watched as I extended each one an invitation to come to hear the Bible talk. Afterward, she said, “Those people won’t come to the Kingdom Hall. Our minister, missionaries and religious teachers have been trying so many years to get them to come to our church, and I haven’t seen one of them yet.” I was pleased to inform her of the three young British Indians who have been coming to the meetings and have already begun to publish the Kingdom along with Jehovah’s witnesses. This was a great surprise to her; but not to Jehovah’s witnesses, who know that Christ Jesus is now gathering out his “other sheep” from all nationalities on the earth, today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One afternoon as I was working my territory over for the third time 1 came to a certain house where I had never been able to find anyone at home. Upon knocking a cheerful voice called out for me to come inside. I began immediately to give a witness. She listened intently, and when I was finished she excused herself and went into an adjoining room. In a few minutes she returned and handed me the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Plan of the Ages,</span><span class="font6"> and said, “I have read this book many times and as you talk I find many things identical.” She was overjoyed to learn that I was from the same organization and immediately took the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font6"> She was even more pleased when I explained how she could have her own home Bible study. Only endurance in continually calling back will guarantee our and others' salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So we have come to an end of another joyful service year and a new one has begun. We look forward to more “other sheep” to eome to the one fold of safety.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>FRENCH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Even the South American tropical colony of French Guiana is served by Kingdom messengers. It does not have a good reputation for living conditions, as disease is widespread and the hot, rainy climate makes the inhabitants indifferent toward life. There are real problems to overcome in this land. A pioneer worked for part of the year in this country with excellent success, putting on public meetings and arousing much interest. A company publisher now serves well in the capital city, Cayenne. The Branch servant at Surinam looks after the work in French Guiana, and gives us the following report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until about a year and a half ago French Guiana had not heard the proclamation of the truth. A pioneer brother did some good, energetic witnessing there during 3947; but in Januarj, 1948, he went to Guadeloupe. Although he had much opposition, the seed that he sowed, and the plants that he watered, together with Jehovah’s blessings, have brought forth fruit. Not a great increase; but a company publisher is now alone preaching the good news. Surely, when the truth has once entered a nation or language it is there to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The company publisher has been continuing the book studies that the pioneer left behind, and during the eight months that he has been preaching he has averaged 38 hours, 16 back-calls and 5 book studies per month. He has not been doing this without opposition. The religionists warned their flocks not to have anything to do with the books or to read the Bible; but, as the apostle said, that opposition helped to increase the interest. (Philippians 1:12) When the three-day district assembly was held in Paramaribo, Surinam, this company publisher came via Pan American World Airways to be baptized, to attend the discourses and to take part in the Kingdom proclamation. After working with the pioneers and company publishers for two weeks he returned to push the advance of true worship more zealously in Cayenne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new French publication, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> together with Bibles and other publications, arrived in Cayenne three months after they were shipped from New York. The Catholic Bibles have brought many comments from the interested; they wonder how Jehovah’s witnesses could get the Bibles, when they had always heard that it was not printed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Steady and consistent expansion has been going on in the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses in Sweden. A spirit of unity pervades everywhere and the brethren rejoice in their privileges of service. When the new arrangement for pioneer work was announced, the brethren in Sweden responded well. Pioneer ranks increased from a high peak of 97 to 182 during the year. One of the difficulties in Sweden in the past twelve months was obtaining sufficient paper to print the literature. Some supplies were sent from Brooklyn, and, by the Lord’s grace, sufficient material will be kept on hand for their Bible studies. The Branch servant gives us a good picture of what has been going on in Sweden during the year, and here is his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no doubt ns to what is responsible for this increase. It is the circuit arrangement with the servants to the brethren visiting regularly and staying one week in each company, whereby the irregular, the inactive and the new ones are getting properly looked after and helped and the company organizations trimmed. And, last but not least, the circuit assemblies, with their enthusing and cementing effect and where the individual publishers as well as the companies can get their problems respecting the service ventilated and solved. When .Brother Knorr visited us, in June, 1947, lie stated that the real effect of this circuit arrangement would become visible during 1948; and so it has. It was very interesting, in this connection, to watch the attendance at the district assembly (comprising all the circuits) held at Orebro in August, which was the biggest gathering we have ever had in this country, nearly 2,200 of the publishers being present. And, as some one remarked, this was so, not in spite of the many circuit assemblies, but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">because of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On that assembly at Orebro I have already submitted a separate report; hence I will now confine myself to quoting part of an article that appeared in the leading religious daily in this country, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Svenska Moryonbladet</span><span class="font6"> of Stockholm, five days after the assembly and written by their local correspondent: “ . . . Politely but determinedly, systematically and energetically they invited people to their meetings, spread their literature and agitated for the movement. How much literature there was spread or how much they did win during these days is perhaps not so easy to say. But it is a fact that all Orebro knew about this convention, the newspapers practically publishing nothing about it notwithstanding. And not only Orebro felt that there was a big gathering taking place. In buses and motorcars they went to neighboring towns also and propagated their doctrine. Kumla, for instance, was invaded by four busloads, mostly young people . . . When one watches such a systematic and purposeful campaign as the one waged by the ‘witnesses’ during their convention as well as always, one must stop to think. There must be something in the propaganda and in the colporteured literature. Far from all who buy or get their literature are reading it carefully or becoming proselytes. But the books </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6"> there and carry out their mission and propagate their message. The ‘witnesses’ know this and do not miss their opportunities. They reckon to get their literature into every home, everywhere. They sow a seed which will germinate and grow. And one day there will be a harvest. ...” In this connection it was interesting to learn the other day from Orebro how one single publisher had got no less than seven book studies going already, on back-calls made from addresses furnished during the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not all the priests in this country are opposing the truth, however. In one parish not so far from Stockholm a sister of the Bethel family had an interview with the priest, and when they parted he said: “If this is what Jehovah’s witnesses are teaching and the way they work, then I must revise my opinion about them.” Another instance: An old pioneer sister arranged for a public lecture with the nearest company servant as the speaker. The attendance was 16. including the local priest. He listened attentively and made notations all through the lecture. At the close he asked many questions and admitted many errors of the church. Among other things, he said that he was sorry because the people would not come to church even if he were to preach the truth to them. The brother then said that he and his colleagues ought to do as Christ and his followers ; that is, go from house to house. The priest replied: “Yes, we ought to do that but we are cowards and too lazy for it, and besides that we have too much to do about worldly things.” First at 11: 30 p.m. the priest was through with his questions and shook hands very friendly, thanking for the information he had got.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for hindrances to our work, the only thing worth mentioning is the enforcement of conscription law which has caused several of the servants to the brethren as well as pioneers to be taken behind bars for periods of varying length. Some of the Bethel boys have also had this experience during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Christian ministers of the Most High God “will sing praises unto thee among the nations”. In the land of Switzerland there are many who are desirous of doing this work, helping the people of good-will to learn the truth. Switzerland is itself a land of many nationalities, for in it are people from France, Italy and Germany. The country is divided into three parts, each having its own language and own customs, but it still carries on as one nation, Switzerland. The people of this country have remained neutral through the last two world wars and therefore have not gone through the terrible destruction that comes to nations engaging in war. Because of their prosperity they have become a proud and self-centered people; so one finds difficulty in approaching them with the message of the Kingdom. But patience and persistence on the part of Jehovah's witnesses have brought good results in the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society operates a printing plant at Berne, and there excellent work has been done by the Bethel family. Due to the call for books, booklets and magazines from the war-torn countries of Europe, the Berne printing plant has been obliged to do a much greater amount of work this year than in 1947. In fact, the books, booklets and magazines printed in 1947 were 1,487,468, to compare with this past service year with a production of 2,443,732. These figures indicate that nearly one million more pamphlets and books were produced for the peoples of Europe to read in their study of God’s Word. Additionally, handbills and miscellaneous printing were done to the extent of 2,336,711 pieces. At the close of the service year there were 53 brethren working in the Bethel home. They enjoyed, too, gathering clothing and other relief materials together to be sent to various countries where the need was greater. Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good-will in Switzerland have been very generous in giving this assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is certainly good to see the excellent progress made in Switzerland during the year. The brethren there have had their difficulties, but they have put up a good fight in the courts so as to carry on with the true worship of God, and the Lord has blessed them in their efforts. The Branch servant sends us an interesting report, and parts of it are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, by the Lord’s grace, it has been possible to Increase the number of publishers by a round 10 percent (9.8 percent to be exact). The distribution of books was raised over 100 percent above the former service year, which in turn has considerably improved the back-call and book-study work. The earnest, rousing call of the Society to enter the full-time service—principally by means of the three pioneer letters and then on the occasion of the district assemblies—has not failed in its purpose. Although we are still far from having 10 percent of all publishers in the pioneer ranks, nevertheless almost double the number of full-time ministers have stood in this blessed service of our glorious King during this year in comparison with the year 1947. They tasted how gracious the Lord Is and continue to experience this daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The introduction of the new working method was definitely one reason, together with the release of the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in both French and German, that in the past service year 25,806 books (which means more than 100 percent over the foregoing year) were placed in the hands of the people of good-will. The complaint that Jehovah’s witnesses are peddling booksellers and not ministers of the gospel has been increasingly raised against them. Forty-four cases have been reported to our office where our publishers of the Kingdom message have been held up by the police and charged with transgressing the peddling laws. The purpose of such complaints is to hinder Jehovah’s witnesses from accepting contributions toward the cost of production for their printed sermons from people of good-will. With the help of the Lord w<sup>T</sup>e have energetically fought against this false and unjust charge during the past year; for Jehovah’s witnesses are not peddlers, or begging for alms, but are ministers of the gospel ordained by Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make this clear to the authorities, police officers and judges has been our goal. We were privileged to have very encouraging experiences while waging this warfare, and the results achieved demonstrate that many officials have relegated Jehovah’s witnesses into the class of hawkers and peddlers out of ignorance of the true circumstances. During the many discussions that we have had with the authorities in all parts of the country we could convince most of their officers that Jehovah’s witnesses are not peddlers but are ministers. In this way about two-thirds of the cases reported could be settled before they reached the courtroom for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, two prominent cases came up before court. The first case that we shall mention engaged the attention of the judicial authorities in French Switzerland. In the year 1931 the Superior Court of Canton Vaud pronounced judgment in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses, stating that our work did not come under the statute bearing on itinerant vendors at that time. This acquittal was a matter of annoyance to many. And now they went to work to “frame mischief by a law” just as the Bible foretold they would do in this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second lawsuit came up for trial in the canton of Berne. The Superior Court of this canton has pronounced adverse judgments over a period of 40 years against traveling ministers who have given people showing interest printed sermons, and who have accepted voluntary contributions for same. Ten years ago this court sentenced a minister of the gospel, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, for peddling who had received no contribution at all. This may serve to show what a stiff fight we had to prepare ourselves for when it became necessary to appeal a case that we had lost in the lower courts, before this Superior Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main task in the defense was to clearly show the court the difference between a preacher or minister of the gospel and a commercial vendor of merchandise. After a rather long deliberation the court pronounced the judgment and declared the accused witness of Jehovah, a co-worker of the Berne Bethel, free of all “pains and penalties”, declaring thereby that the evangelical preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses is not peddling in the sense of the law, even when Jehovah’s witnesses accept voluntary contributions for their printed sermons. In the written decision the Superior Court motivates this judgment in the interests of freedom as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the case under examination, setting aside the fact that no profit was realized, nothing in the conduct of the accused discloses a professional character in his activity. It cannot be established that there was an intention to obtain a profit—either for himself or for the account of Jehovah’s witnesses—by means of peddling. The circumstances allow the conclusion that the accused, putting aside any selfish instinct, acted exclusively in a noble and unselfish purpose. The offer of the booklets was not made with the expectation of a compensatory payment which would cover at least the cost of production. The best reward of the accused consisted evidently in the increase of the number of the adepts of the sect and in the favorable reception accorded the evangelization. If it is true that the regulations regarding peddling are intended to protect the public against those who want to molest them, it would, however, be an exaggeration to hinder religious propaganda from house to house under the cover of the law on the commerce of merchandise and to thus violate the freedom of opinion as guaranteed by the Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This decision which protects the freedoms of the citizen anchored in the Constitution, not only came as glad tidings to us in the Bethel but rejoiced the hearts of all the active ministers of the gospel throughout the country and, without doubt, acted as a stimulant to many publishers to more vigorously join in the song of praise to Jehovah’s name In order to demonstrate their gratitude. This decision has aided us in convincing reasonable police officials and freedom-loving judges that Jehovah’s witnesses are ministers, and not peddlers, in many other cases reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one village a publisher was received at the door by a young man about to receive his ordination as Catholic priest. The publisher politely handed him the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span><span class="font6"> After a short discussion the young man tore the booklet up and threw it at the brother’s feet. While the publisher was witnessing at the next house this budding Catholic priest stole all the printed sermons that the publisher had in his brief case attached to his bicycle before the house. The witness immediately suspected this young man, of course, who, by the way, was wearing clerical attire. Called to account, he was forced to admit the theft. The publisher reported this incident to the police, who afterwards assisted us in clearing up this matter. We were ready to forego legal proceedings in this illegal intervention and disturbance of our preaching activity, if this young Catholic priest would admit in writing his fanatical act and adequately excuse himself, and at the same time replace the value of the stolen literature. As the police were fully informed, this budding young priest considered it wiser to admit his action. He wrote: “. . . that I in no wise sought to conceal the appropriation of your literature which I took while the preacher endeavored to persuade my relatives at the door of the neighboring house, and that I had every intention of paying for this literature immediately ... I hope that you will not carry this matter further.” His lawyer wrote as well: “The manner of procedure of . . . was incorrect when he appropriated publications from the bag on the bicycle of your minister.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In concluding this report we can say with the psalmist: “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness.” All that we were privileged by the Lord’s grace to do and experience during the past year fills our hearts with gratitude and rejoicing. Jehovah has strengthened our hands and our feet to courageous Kingdom service. Our wish and our prayer is that we may continue to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name in unity with his people earth-wide.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are well over two million inhabitants in the country of Uruguay, and the publishers there are ad-vaneing the true worship of Jehovah to the very best of their ability. The Lord has blessed their efforts, for he is now gathering together the “other sheep” and bringing them unto his organization in goodly numbers. As in all the South American countries, the Society’s program of expansion has been carried on well and the people have been given the opportunity of hearing the truth. There is much more to be done, and the witnesses of Jehovah in Uruguay appreciate the responsibility and are looking forward to the new year with joy, delighted at their privilege of serving the people of good-will. The Branch servant tells us some interesting things that have occurred there during the past year, all of which have stimulated greater interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the continued efforts of the publishers and the fact that many Catholic persons are bothering the priests with Bible questions brought up by the witnesses which the priests cannot answer and the fact that they are leaving the Catholic church has caused the curates to come out more and more boldly against the witnesses in futile efforts to keep the people of good-will in subjection. Recently something on this order was heard on the Catholic radio program, “Soon we will have to take drastic action against a religious sect called Jehovah’s witnesses that is causing great havoc in the church.” On another occasion they mentioned all the Protestant sects and gave objections to each one and then at last brought up Jehovah’s witnesses as the worst of all. The howling of the pastors always results in the freeing of the “sheep”, and thus the Lord turns their prophecy against his people into a blessing to them and an honor and vindication for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last service year ended with a peak of 211 publishers in the service. This service year ended with another peak of 307 publishers. In October we had our first circuit assembly of the year in Mercedes. Some of the brethren went early with the servant to the brethren to this city to make the preparations and to organize the event. It was really a most joyful occasion. Arrangements were made for publicaddress equipment in the main public square where the Catholic cathedral is always found in any Latin-American city. There were around a thousand persons in the square when the talk began and many of them heard the entire lecture on the subject, “My Kingdom Is Not of This World.” This talk was given at 9 p.m., when there are the most people in the plaza. During the afternoon we had the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study and an immersion service. Five persons were baptized in the Rio Negro to show their consecration to do the Lord’s will. One sister and her 13-year-old boy walked 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) on foot to get to this assembly and were happy to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arrangement whereby the publishers here in Montevideo deliver the magazines to the subscribers was instituted in the month of February and has had some very gratifying results. The subscribers too are thankful for this service because through the mail sometimes more than half the magazines would not get to the subscriber. Also this gives an opportunity for the publishers to know and talk to the subscriber and at times place literature and start studies. One publisher took the initiative to present a combination of all the booklets published by the Society to those to whom he delivered the magazines, with gratifying results. Quite a number of these looked over the booklets and selected those they didn’t already have and contributed for them. Another publisher decided to take advantage of the opportunity to witness to the subscribers when delivering the magazines, and placed all the literature she had in her bag. Another publisher delivering the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines was received at the door very warmly by the young daughter. The father was unable to attend the door but sent his daughter with the last issue of the magazine he had received and one peso asking for the new Spanisli concordance of the Bible advertised on the cover of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font6"> The only copy the publisher had had her husband’s name written in it, but the subscriber said it didn’t make any difference and that he would take it anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To accomplish the distribution of the magazines the city has been divided into zones according to territory numbers so that the magazines can be gotten out quickly. This also results in a higher number of renewals. Some publishers that have never known their city have taken interest in this work and have become familiar with the names and locations of the streets so as to have a part in the work of distributing magazines. There are now about 500 subscribers in Montevideo alone. Other cities have difficulties also in the delivery of magazines and would like to take on this same service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Indeed with deep joy that this report is submitted. We have tasted the goodness and mercy of the Lord during the past year and can see that some progress has been made. When we consider the wide field yet to be covered in this small country and the great lack of publishers needed to properly care for the people of good-will and give the witness during the time yet remaining, we are spurred on to greater efforts and to resolution to push the battle even more. Since the visit of the president of the Society to Uruguay in 1945 we have seen the number of publishers increase from 28 to over 300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have worked comparatively little of the country until now, but we are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to push the battle so that soon there will be those dedicated to the Lord in all parts of the republic to sing praises to him among the nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The singers of praise in Venezuela received many blessings from the Lord during the past service year. They have had in mind as have the brethren in other nations, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” Determined, by the Lord’s grace, to do this, they have seen their efforts result in expansion. The average number of publishers for the year increased from 29 in 1947 to 51 for this year, an increase of 75 percent. There is a great amount of work to be done in this country, and it is hoped that during the coming year more students from Gilead will enter Venezuela to carry on the educational work with those already there. The song of praise must become louder, and we want it to increase so that more and more will hear the truth. The Branch servant tells us some of the interesting high-lights of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the year the Branch office arranged to send two representatives to visit and spend a week with each company in the interior. The brethren in the other companies outside of Caracas had written many times asking for someone to come to help them by instructing them in the proper way to carry on the service. The brethren traveled by bus, which is really quite an experience in Venezuela. The seats in the buses are small, being close together, as most of the Venezuelans are small, so these two North Americans found that they hardly had enough room for their legs. On the top of the bus It is not uncommon to see beds, sewing machines, tables, chickens, turkeys, bananas, etc., along with the suitcases or baggage of the travelers. If the passenger is going only a short distance he doesn’t bother to put his chickens or small articles on top but brings them in the bus with him and piles them In the aisle between the seats. The bus stops at any place at any time to pick up a rider, and when the seats are full they squat on little boxes in the aisle. They always seem to find room for another one. A few miles out of Caracas the road is dirt, very rough, and dusty ; so you experience a rugged Journey as the bus goes bouncing along as fast as it possibly can. After two days of travel they arrived in the first company to be visited. On one occasion while traveling from one company to another the bus broke down, leaving the passengers stranded in a wilderness where only cactus and goats lived, for several hours, until another bus came along, taking them into the next city for the night. Another time the bus ran out of gas; so the passengers had to wait patiently until someone walked to the nearest village for some gas. In spite of the hardships of travel, the two representatives were able to visit all the companies, giving much assistance to the publishers by working with them In the service and instructing them in the correct way to conduct studies. During the trip four baptisms were held, giving opportunity to 16 to symbolize their consecration by water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most important event of the year was the circuit assembly held in Caracas in June. For several months we were busy looking for a hall that we could use, but we had no success. Finally we arranged to use a theater during the week, being able to obtain this because the manager of the theater was a person of good-will and a new publisher. We advertised by using handbills, large signs In the streets, and announcements over the radio. The first day attendance was 52, the second day 60, while on the third day, for the public talk, 106 were in attendance. An immersion was held and 10 were baptized. This made the total of 40 baptized for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So thus ended this service year of singing praise to Jehovah, and we can truly say that the brethren here lived up to the yeartext by singing songs of worship to God with the other nations. As we enter the new year we give thanks for our privileges of service with determination to continue singing the truth to these bedarkened people until the end, thus giving honor to Jehovah God and his reigning King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Dictatorship never brought peace and happiness to anyone, not even to those in power. Yugoslavia is a country that has rulers who are not loved by the people, and the rulers are not trying to cultivate the love of the people. When dictators get the land and the people under their power, the people suffer. Such rulers are never content and never even sure of their own lives nor of their positions. It is a constant fight to reign. Being under these conditions makes it most miserable for everyone concerned. It is difficult to get information out of Yugoslavia, but a little news leaks through from some sources. It is difficult for those outside of Yugoslavia to even send assistance to those inside the country, in the way of food and clothing. If such assistance is attempted the authorities either steal the small parcels that are sent in or find fault with the people who have requested help, and they are punished as a result of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently some more of Jehovah’s witnesses have been persecuted, and the few brethren who are in Yugoslavia must be very cautious, because the authorities are always on their heels, watching every move they make. Some were arrested and sentenced at Ljubljana, one for a term of six years and another for four years. No report has come through as yet concerning four others. Merely for being a Christian, merely for preaching the gospel and telling the people of the hope set forth in the Bible, people are thrown into prisons. The Society has learned that 31 persons attended the Memorial service in a certain part of Yugoslavia, but full reports have not come through. It would be quite unwise to state where any Christians meet in that country, because they would be tracked down, persecuted and destroyed. These are conditions that exist in what they call a “civilized, Christian country”. Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia are determined to “praise thee yet more and more”. They know the time has come to preach this gospel of the Kingdom, and this they are trying to do to the best of their ability. They are fully aware of the fact that the most the Yugoslavian religionists and rulers can do is to take their life, and this they are willing to lay down for the gospel’s sake. Such zeal will stimulate Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere to carry on faithfully, for they see the text for last year fulfilled: “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark221"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES CONTINUE THE SINGING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">The activity of God’s ministers, as reported in this 1949 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font7"> brings much joy to the faithful servants of the Most High. All who have taken part in this great work cannot but feel somewhat like the man with the writer’s inkhorn by his side. Ezekiel wrote, in the 9th chapter, verse 11: “And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.” Jehovah’s witnesses made their report; they did as the Lord commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of the 1948 service year Jehovah’s witnesses made their plans for increase and chose as their theme for the year the text, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” (Ps. 57: 9, A.S.P.) Now they can take a retrospective view of the year’s work and say, with confidence and satisfaction, that they did “sing praises”—not only in one isolated spot on the earth, but in all parts of the world. On all continents, in every principal nation, among the isles of the sea, wherever the people gave an ear to hear, Jehovah’s witnesses have been singing, speaking a good message. While they rejoice in the great expansion that has been accomplished, they all fully appreciate that there is yet more and more work ahead. So for the year 1949 they have chosen a new text; not one pointing up a different theme, but one that enlarges and broadens the theme expressed in the 1948 yeartext. Their ambitions and hopes are so well stated by the psalmist David, who wrote at Psalm 71:14: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I . . </span><span class="font7">. will praise thee yet more and more.” (A.S.P.) Jehovah’s witnesses will continue the singing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not a matter of stopping now and waiting for things to change. No; it is a matter of increasing the proclamation “The kingdom of heaven is at hand!” in ever greater volume, “more and more,” in all parts of the earth. This is the determination of Jehovah’s witnesses; this is their delight; this is their joy; this is their life! They want to praise Jehovah “more and more” and aid others to become publishers of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are very grateful that God is so patient and long-suffering. We know that Jehovah is not slow in fulfilling his promises, but he exercises his great patience toward all creatures so that they may gain salvation too through hearing this good news of the Kingdom. “The Lord is not slow with what he promises, according to certain people’s idea of slowness; no, he is long-suffering for your sake, he does not wish any to perish but all to betake them to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3: 9, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font7"> We accept Peter’s counsel when he says, “consider that the long-suffering of our Lord means salvation.” (2 Pet. 3:15, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font7"> What a grand and glorious privilege is ours to be able to go out into the field service with this message of salvation for another year, and during the coming twelve months build up a report even better than last year’s to turn in to the Lord. By so doing we can prove our integrity, which not only gains salvation for ourselves, but by our good works also bring salvation to others. To think that the Lord allows us more time to preach, that others may be saved, is in itself great satisfaction. Jehovah’s witnesses will take advantage of this time in the “last days” to minister the good news of God’s kingdom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus told his disciples that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall the end come”. (Matt. 24:14, A.S'.V.) God’s ministers know that not until the preaching work is done will the end come. God will sec to it that the message is given. More important than this, the Kingdom message must be preached for a “testimony unto all the nations”! This is done in vindication of his name. Yes, they must learn that Jehovah is God, that his kingdom is the only hope of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are grateful that they have more time in which to give this testimony, thoroughly, convincingly, without hesitation, with joy and gladness. They can sing his praises unto all the nations more than ever, and to more nations. This, by God’s grace, they will do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year’s report clearly indicates this determined attitude on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses from one end of the earth to the other. This spirit to sing praises to Jehovah is radiated from all countries where Jehovah’s witnesses reside. All of God’s ministers feel the close unity, the co-operation, the oneness of mind, the peace that pervades the ranks of this “peculiar people”. We are peculiar in the eyes of the world because we are not a part of the world. If we were, they would love Jehovah’s witnesses; for the world loves its own. However, Jehovah’s .witnesses have consecrated their lives to serve Jehovah “yet more and more” and therefore have become prominently identified as a people preaching this gospel of the Kingdom, which is no part of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a joy to associate with such a wonderful organization, and it is a pleasure to send the love and greetings of all the brethren everywhere to their fellow workers in every other part of the earth through this annual report. I, too, would like to say that it has been a real pleasure to compile on your behalf your report of field service for the year 1948. I am sure it will bring as much joy to you, as servants of the Lord, as it has to me. Together all of Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to sing praises unto the Most High “more and more” in all the nations of the world; and to Jehovah we give all the glory, now and forever.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark223"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark224"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">In accordance with the Charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, due notice was mailed to each member of the corporation, announcing the annual meeting of the Society to be held October 1, 1948, at ten o’clock in the forenoon at the registered offices of the Society in the Wabash Building, 410 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh 22, Pennsylvania. The president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, presided and called on William E. Brusman to open the meeting with prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The secretary reported that there were 423 members in the organization and that 416 were actually present or represented by proxy. The business to be taken care of was the election of three directors whose terms had expired. The persons nominated were Nathan H. Knorr, Lyman A. Swingle and Milton G. Henschel. All three were unanimously elected as directors of the Society for a period of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the usual business was taken care of the president of the Society suggested that in view of the fact that so many district assemblies were being arranged for 1949 it might be well to have one of the district assemblies in Pittsburgh at the time of the annual meeting, October 1, 1949. Charles H. Stewart, Sr., moved that arrangements be made to find a suitable place in Pittsburgh or the immediate vicinity which could be used for the annual meeting as well as for the district assembly on October 1, 1949. This motion was seconded, and unanimously adopted by the members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several members of the Society then gave brief talks to those present. The secretary and treasurer, Grant Suiter, spoke first relative to the faithfulness of the Society in keeping constantly before the minds of its associates the necessity of being thoroughly oc-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">255</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">cupied in Theocratic activity. John B. Robb was then called upon to make a report. He is a member of the corporation with residence in England who was present at the annual meeting. He told all present of the fine progress of the work in the British Isles. Next Donald Haslett, a member of the Bethel family for many years and recently Branch servant for the Hawaiian Islands, gave some very interesting information concerning Japan and the work that will have to be done there. He had just finished a course of training at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and was now preparing for travel to Japan to act as the Society’s Branch representative. Closing the session, the president of the Society gave a report showing how the Society had fulfilled its chartered purposes during the past service year. He mentioned the great expansion of the work, particularly during 1948, which was the outstanding year of all time for extensiveness of Kingdom proclamation. The annual meeting adjourned at 12:05 p.m. with prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Thursday morning, October 7, all of the members of the board of directors met in the president’s office to elect officers to carry on the business of the Society for the ensuing year. All officers were reelected, namely, N. II. Knorr as president, F. W. Franz as vice-president, Grant Suiter as secretary and treasurer, and H. H. Riemer as .assistant secretary and treasurer. Other matters of business were discussed and expression was made by all of their gratitude to Jehovah God for the privilege of serving Him. All were thankful for the privileges of service they enjoyed as God’s ministers and as directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It was evident that all honor and glory should go to the Supreme Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah, for the direction of His people, and the directors were grateful to be Jehovah’s witnesses, declaring with all faithful servants of the Lord that they, too, will praise Jehovah more and more.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font11">YEGRTEXT FOR 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I . . . will yet praise thee more and more.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 71:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is pleased with servants who want to praise Him more and more. What else would a son of God want to do? Of course, that does not mean praying all day or hiding away in a mountain retreat, there to be in solitude and meditation. At least that is not what David had in mind when he said, “I . . . will yet praise thee more and more.” David made clear just what he had in mind in the 71st Psalm; for he said, “My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.” Here he clearly indicates that he was going to talk and express himself so that he might show forth the righteous acts of the Lord and how salvation might be gained. He was not going to do it just once in a while, but he was going to speak of the greatness of God every day. He did not know how many days, because he was an elderly man; and, therefore, he did not know the number thereof. But he was going to use his time, his ability, his strength, continually in praising the Lord more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Further, in the 16th verse, he shows that he was going to use his mouth and means of expression, when he said, “I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.” To make mention of something the individual must express himself, and so David did. Nor did he do it just in his old age: he started from youth, for he said, “0 God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.” This glorious privilege of praising.the Most High God is not something just for old men; no, it is something for youth to do, carrying it on through middle age and right down until the days when gray hairs come. Even then he should have that same zeal and determination to praise God more and more. Being a minister is not an old man’s occupation; it is for youth as well, for youth can express the wondrous works of God. In his zeal and love of life he can feel the greatness of the handiwork of the Most High. As he gets older he thinks of things more soberly and he marvels at the wondrous works of his Creator. A child brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord will in his youth want to preach the good message of life to others and continue right down until he is an elderly man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did David in his old age with his gray head think just of doing this talking and of mentioning the righteousness of God to those around him? No, he wanted to show the strength of God “unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come”. Reflect for a moment on the zeal of this elderly man David. He wanted to make the glories of God and his wondrous works known to the entire generation, to the young, the old, the middle-aged, the men and the women—all those within his nation. He was a preacher; he was a servant of God; he was a man after God’s own heart. David is a good example of how praise should be carried on. Praise is not just prayer and meditation nor the singing of songs. All that can be included in praise, but the praise David was speaking of was far greater and more comprehensive. It took in the great work of expanding the preaching of God’s good message to the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Greater David, Christ Jesus, was a true example of one who brought praise to his Father in heaven. Continually he did his Father’s will, and we all know of his acts of praise-giving: going from door to door, preaching publicly his bold and clarion call for all to “repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. This was heard from one end of Palestine to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the other. Jesus, too, wanted the generation with whieh he was living to learn the truth, and as the fruits of his labors he established a Christian organization then and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the days of Jesus until now the Christian ehurch has been growing and getting older in years, until now it is 1900 years old; yet in its old age it has the spirit and vigor of youth. The message that Christ Jesus gave to his church is one which the ehurch feels responsible to take unto the ends of the earth in obedience to his command, 'Go ye, therefore, and diseiple all nations.’ Even in its later years that zeal and determination to serve God is within the very bones of the creature. As David and the Greater David, Christ Jesus, wanted the new generation to learn and know, so today Jehovah’s witnesses want a new generation to hear about God, His Son, Christ Jesus, and the Kingdom, the only hope for the world. None of the anointed or the “other sheep” of God are completely satisfied with what they did in their past years. Even though they were zealous in their youth and accomplished much in praising Jehovah, his name and his Word, still they want to do it more and more. That is the very spirit of God’s organization in the earth in these last days. The remnant of the bride of Christ along with the new generation which has come forward and hearkened to the message of the Kingdom are actively engaged in proclaiming the grandest message of all time. Nothing in heaven or in earth will slacken their zeal and determination to praise Jehovah more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their inward feeling is to the effect “I will add more to all thy praise”. “I praise thee more than ever.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> praise thee the longer, the more.” Praise-giving is endless as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned. It is their desire to gain eternal life, and so doing they will have this gracious pleasure of praising the Lord for eternity. As the day draws near for the new world of righteousness to take complete control, Jehovah’s witnesses will increase their tempo, their volume and their quality of sweet singing so that the “other sheep” who are scattered unto the ends of the earth may be comforted with the grand and glorious message, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Then these hearers, too, will join the ever-growing ranks of God’s ordained ministers, Jehovah’s witnesses, and will sing with them, “I . . . will yet praise thee more and more.” This work will continue until every creature in heaven and in earth joins in the grand and glorious chorus of praise to the Most High.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The comments following the daily texts are taken from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> (W) as of the year 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.—1 Tim. 4:10,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> A.S.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our eternal salvation is conditional upon our continued faith, obedience and faithfulness toward God in the footsteps of Christ. What made the Israelites and mixed multitude once saved from Egypt lose out before reaching God’s rest in the Promised Land was lack of faith in God, a failure to believe him all the way through the wilderness. Faith and belief meant obedience to him. Now with the prize so near at this end of the world, let us not lose out through disobedience and quitting due to not keeping on believing God till the prize of eternal salvation is gained. Let us hold on to our belief. In that belief in God and Christ, keep on obeying him, working and striving in his service. We, now in a saved condition, will have God specially save us to the hoped-for eternal salvation, provided we prove our belief in him to the end. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, . . . in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh.—Jude 7,8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the same way that the filthy people of Sodom and Gomorrah polluted their flesh with loose sex relations and unnatural relations with the male sex, so these evil-intentioned sneaks defile the fleshly body. They are bent on corrupting those inside the organization of God’s people. They have no regard for the apostolic command: “Flee fornication.” However, they are dreamers. Why? Because they imagine they can ignore the plain teaching of Bible history showing how God deals with the wicked. They dream of being able to pervert the graciousness of God into an excuse for disorderly conduct and to get off without a sentence of punishment by the Judge. One certain day they will find they arc not in a dream world ; they will wake up to find him executing sentence against them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let them hear, and say, It is truth.—Isa. &nbsp;&nbsp;: 0.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah is testing the ears of all nations today to find the ears that hear. He makes the test by means of the unusual message he sends out. As the Creator he made humankind with ears to hear, and now that he sends forth his message to all nations there is no excuse for their not hearing. Each and every one upon whose eardrums the sound of the message falls is allowed the liberty to listen to it and give it a favorable hearing or else to shut it out of his head. It is now the time of stupendous world-change. It is mankind’s time of sore need for a righteous world-ruler, and Jehovah, as Sovereign of the universe, has raised up his Chief Official to be the royal ruler over all our earth and its peoples. The important question for each one who comes within range of the divine message about this is: “Who is there among you that will give ear to this?” (42 : 23, A.S.F.) The testing of ears by this grand message is on! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.—Isa. 55: 8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God is far different from this world. His thoughts are not its thoughts, and his ways are not its ways. He is the great Life-giver, and his purpose to give everlasting life to men of good-will differs far from the religious ideas of this world. For this reason it is only by His grace that we exist in this year 1949 and are able to move about in the earth and make expression of our thoughts to others and to do the work we do. Man owes appreciation toward God for what he has done for man without his deserving it. Those who are now acting before the eyes of the world as Jehovah’s witnesses give evidence of an appreciation of Almighty God, the Creator. They recognize that to maintain his gift of life to them and the privileges that go with it, they must always honor him as their Creator and bring praise to him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ue is the God—who formed the earth and made it—he established it—he did not create it a chaos, he formed it for a dwelling-place.—Isa. If5:18, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God made living creatures and made a place for them to live in and enjoy life. He knew each intelligent creature would want a suitable place that he might call home and where he might feel at home. With man and woman in view he created the garden of Eden and put them in it, offering them the opportunity to make it their eternal dwelling-place. In fact, with mankind in view, Jehovah God created our earthly globe, because it was his purpose to have it peopled with lovely, perfect men and women who should occupy the whole of it forever as their permanent home. Agreeable to such purpose, he will never destroy mankind’s natural dwelling-place, this material earth. The day comes when the righteous men and women will live forever in peace and happiness; and hence the earth was made to abide forever as their natural place of abode. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.—1 John 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This makes it certain that such spiritual sonship is a special gift. (John 1:12,13) It is due to the continual giving on the heavenly Father’s part that any of us become his spiritual sons. First, he gave us time to repent of our sinful worldly course, by letting the human race descend from Adam and Eve till now. That we might realize our sinful, undone state and might repent and turn to God’s way of life, he sent us the message of truth telling about recovery from sin and death through Christ Jesus. (2 Tim. 2:25,26) Unless God thus imparts the knowledge of the truth, the persons seeking eternal life from God can never find His way and come to Christ Jesus, through whom he bestows eternal life. It is by the gift of the knowledge of the truth that God draws men to his Son in repentance and builds up their faith. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope.—Rom. 8: 20, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s statement in Eden against that old Serpent, the Devil, summed up a great hope, a positive hope that the great introducer of wickedness and all those following him would be destroyed by a deliverer. It was first after distinguishing himself as the “God jf hope” by sentencing the Devil with those words that God spoke to Eve and Adam about bringing forth children. If it had not been for this hope of deliverance by the Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> he would not have let the disobedient pair live further and bring forth the human creation subject to the present vanity. But the hope that he set forth in his mercy made it worth while for those to be born who would believe the hope, act upon it and gain salvation by it. Thus beiug subject for a few years to vanity under Satan was better than not coming to existence at all. W 4/Z5</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.—Rev. 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here believing men and women have the glorious promise of a King for a thousand years. All peoples can be grateful that Christendom’s religious interpretations of the 1000-year reign have proved false, for the long reign of the popes and bishops, who sit on thrones and talk of their period in office as a reign, has never beer, marked by the binding of Satan the Devil and the blessings for mankind that the Bible promises during the true millennium. The promised millennial reign is yet future, but near. The King for that thousand years is not a succession of so-called “vicegerents of Christ”, but Christ Jesus himself. That he will reign in person is proved by the fact that the faithful Christians who have part in the first resurrection are said to live and reign “with </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chbist</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a thousand years”.—20: 4. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">/I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation to our God.—Rev. 7:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah is the God to whom salvation is to be ascribed. He has provided for the salvation of those who ascribe the glory, majesty, dominion and power for a righteous new world to him. His salvation will work, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is what we want. It is the thing worth contending for against all mockers and subversive elements. It is bv God’s grace that we are saved through faith. If you have that faith and contend for it to hold it, it means your eternal salvation. If you do not have it, lose no time in getting it. Then hold on to it till faith is fully rewarded. If we are all together in this effort, we are going to share salvation in the new world together with all other faithful ones. We now need warning, and to warn us Jude wrote: “I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.—JI cb. 6:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The consecrated, spirit-begotten person tastes powers which are no part of this world and do not have their source in this world, but descend from God through his King Christ Jesus. The King said his kingdom was of the new world which God has promised to set up. God and his Christ are both associated with the new world, the world that comes after the present wicked world is destroyed. Therefore powers that come to the enlightened consecrated person from them are powers of the world to come. If he is made a preaching and teaching ambassador of the Kingdom by means of being anointed with God’s spirit it is a power of the world to come. It is an empowering of him to act as preacher, teacher and servant for the God and the King of the new world. Also he enjoys the organization of God’s people, who are organized Theocratically, not according to this world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 3:16, Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It was God’s beloved Son Jesus Christ that was thus manifested in the flesh. By his devotion to Jehovah as God and Universal Sovereign Jesus held fast to the covenant for the Kingdom as its Heir. Hence when raised from death he was justified, vindicated, or declared righteous. But this justification or vindication was given him in the spirit by rewarding him with spirit life at his resurrection. When he returned to the spirit realms from which he descended to earth, he again appealed in the midst of God’s holy angels in heaven. This paved the way for fulfilling the scripture: “Let all the angels of God worship him.” (Heb. 1:6, A.S.T<sup>7</sup>.) When resurrected he was made so much better than the angels. His godliness under test in the flesh was the healthful means of this great gain. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, . . . beast, . . . false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils.—Rev. 16:13,1 J/.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The mouth is one of the organs of speech. What comes forth from it pictures the utterance, prediction, or teaching, and must have something for its inspiration. The question is, Who inspired it? God’s Word declares that what issues from the mouth of the dragon, the beast and the false prophet has for its inspiration the demons, of whom Satan the Devil is the prince. It speaks of these demons as unclean or foul, and therefore what is inspired by them is also unclean. In the Scriptures frogs are unclean animals, which God’s chosen people were forbidden to eat. Quite fittingly, the spirits or messages that issue from the mouth of the dragon, beast and false prophet are pictured as “three unclean spirits like frogs”. They are identified as “spirits of devils working miracles”. Wonderfully, world rulers listen to their croakings. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.—Luke I}: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As in the case of Isaac’s bride (Gen. 24:3-8), the bride of Christ must agree to forsake this world and all human relationships in order to join him in the spiritual estate pictured by the Promised Land where Abraham and Isaac dwelt. Incidentally this shows that when Christ Jesus comes to claim his bride he does not come into this world in the flesh as he did at his first advent, but his bride class must leave the flesh, undergo a change, and become spiritual and enter the spirit realm. The bride class knows Christ after the flesh no more. As we read: “Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord is </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">one spibit.”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1 Cor. 6:16,17) Thus in a most complete sense the bride class forsake worldly and fleshly relationships.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The law here meant is the law of the Creator, Jehovah God the Supreme Lawgiver. For all creation he fixed laws of operation or laws of conduct. His way is the right way; and if hurtful results come from pursuing a different way it is because that is the wrong way. It is a violation of His will and law, and hence it is wrong, an offense against the Supreme Lawgiver. It is not just a mere hurt to the person breaking the law. It is a failure to do the will of the righteous Lawgiver; it is disobedience to his law, and he pronounces it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sin.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the Greek language in which the apostle John wrote, the word for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> originally meant </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to miss,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> as, for instance, to miss one’s road. Then it came to mean to fail of doing something, to fail of one’s purpose, to miss one’s point, to go wrong. Sin is therefore a missing or failing to do the will and law of God. It displeases him and is punished. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great prosperity have they who love thy law, and no obstacles confront them.—Ps. 119:165, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah makes real prosperity sure. To love his law, the keeping of which leads to prosperity, we have to know it. Knowledge of his Word containing his law is important to our lasting prosperity and contentment. If we study it and its law and follow his principles of truth and righteousness, then we are bound to have the contentment that comes from prosperity, and all the obstacles that confront us will pass out of the picture in one way or another. He will help us, and by studying his Word and watching his leadings we shall find the way out. Not that we shall not have problems now and then. We shall. The hardest tasks may arise in our lives, such as problems because our brethren in the faith have been thrown into prison unjustly, but if in the light of his Word we see what we are doing we can overcome the obstacles. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt he saved.—Acts 16:31, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why did Paul and Silas tell the prisonkeeper to believe on Jesus, whom they called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord or Master?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> They did so because this Jesus was the Seed of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> whom God had foretold away back in the garden of Eden who would be bruised in the heel but would recover from it and bruise the wicked Serpent’s head. Hence this Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was Jehovah’s means or agent for bringing to mankind salvation from the Serpent and all his wickedness. Belief in the Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was therefore necessary, for God will not save those who do not believe on the Seed, but will destroy all the Serpent’s unbelieving, opposing seed or offspring. Belief in the Lord Jesus does not cut out belief in Jehovah God, but is inseparably connected with it. (Acts 16:32-34) Why, the very name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> means “Salvation of Jehovah”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/I</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hear ye, and give ear; lie not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken. —Jer. 13:15, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides faith and a love of righteousness, to have an ear for God’s Word we must be humble, and hence teachable and willing to be corrected and shown what is right and true. The most ignorant men can be proud. Persons that arc proud depend upon themselves for salvation, or else they cling to the religious ideas they were previously taught. Because they trust in demons or in human teachers they do not feel lowly enough to confess that these are wrong, and themselves as well. So they reject God’s message of salvation. They do this in pride, to their own destruction. To picture the right attitude, namely, humbleness, willingness to listen, the Bible speaks of inclining the ear toward God, not away from him. A person with only one good ear will turn it to anyone speaking to him. We must do likewise if we want to catch what God teaches. It takes humility to incline our ear. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These . . . rail at dignities. But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil . . . , durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 8, 9, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Michael’s name means “Who is like God?” It shows he is a defender of Jehovah God. All evidence identifies Michael as God’s Chief Son. It proves he was God’s beloved Son who became the “man Christ Jesus”. Unlike Michael, the flesh-defiling dreamers do not respect the dignities or glories from Jehovah. They despise his lordship and therefore talk evil and abusively of those clothed with such dignities and glories, not only certain individuals but the whole visible organization. They look at the flesh ; and because they are burning to defile the flesh they abuse and blaspheme God’s servants in the flesh. Doing so, they presumptuously take liberties such as even the chief one of God’s angels, Michael, did not take. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A people for Ms own possession, zealous of good works. —Titus 2:14, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A complete change takes place in the lives of those who follow Christ’s teachings. It does not take them long to see it is better to obey God rather than men; for the only way to receive life is by being faithful to the great Life-giver in heaven. As God said, he himself is the Savior, and it is he alone that can give everlasting life and blessings in the new world. It is true that among the ranks of the witnesses of the Lord God one can find persons from every walk of life, from every nation, from every kindred, and from every language. Yet, different from this world, they have all the same spirit of love and peace toward their neighbor, and a desire to praise the one God, Jehovah, and to sing his praises unto all the nations. Their indefeatable zeal is a thing that, even though the worldly governmental authorities try to do so, they are unsuccessful in breaking. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Very few peopie feel inclined to give any thought at all to insuring for themselves eternal dwelling-places in the righteous new world. How to gain the latter we are told by Jesus Christ. He put our present housing anxieties in a secondary place when he said: “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.” (Matt. 8:20) He was seeking a permanent abiding-place elsewhere in God’s realm, and he recommended to all those who want to follow him not to mind so much about their present living quarters. Let them make sure for themselves eternal abodes in the future when the present things fail. He put his recommendation in these words: “So I tell you, make friends for yourselves with your ill-gotten wealth, so that when it fails, they may take you into the eternal dwellings.”—Luke 16: 9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This truth is not practicable for everyone, it is only for those who have the gift.—Matt. 19:11, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This matter of ‘not marrying at all’, Jesus said, was for those to whom it was given or who have the gift. But that docs not mean certain men or women are given this single freedom and unconcern about marriage simply without any determination upon their part, whereas this gift is withheld from other men and women and hence in their helplessness they simply cannot resist the attractions to marriage. No; but men and women must determine to have this gift. Otherwise, Jesus would not have said some </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">make themselves</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> eunuchs for the Kingdom’s sake. To make oneself a eunuch of this kind is not an obligation. If it were, it could not be a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gift</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> for us to accept or refuse. But as to the gift, Jesus said some do not accept it. They do not admit it or make room for it in their lives. They do not determine to maintain their single, unencumbered state, as Paul did.—1 Cor. 9: 5. TV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The promise is that the faithful Christian overcomers would reign with Christ for the thousand years, but Paul vigorously denied that the Christians were reigning in his day. He himself did not sit upon an episcopal throne and claim to reign, but he said to the Corinthians who did assume to run ahead and reign as kings cither politically or in a spiritual manner: “You are now full; you are now become rich; </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">you reign without </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">US ; AND I WOULD TO GOD YOU DID REIGN, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that we also might reign with you.” (1 Cor. 4:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> The faithful ovcrcomers reign in heaven with God’s Anointed King after Satan the Serpent has his head bruised, and Paul therefore showed that the 1000-year reign was future by saying to the Christians at Rome: “And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.”—Rom. 16:20. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world.-—Eph. 1:3,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the time of Christ’s death on the tree the foundation of the new world of God’s promise was laid. Hence Christ Jesus can be spoken of as “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world”. (Rev. 13:8) He had to die in order that all those gaining life in the new world might receive cleansing from sin in his blood and be forgiven their transgressions against God. However, Jesus must be a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> foundation for the everlasting new world. For this reason Almighty God resurrected him from the dead to immortal life in heaven. lie thus became a “living stone”, and, as such, he could ascend up to heaven into the presence of God his Father and could be laid as the “sure foundation” of the heavenly organization called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Zion.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Before he was thus laid God foretold he would have a body of faithful followers who would be conformed to Christ’s image.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ always confessed and showed himself inferior to Jehovah God. All the Holy Scriptures bear witness to his subordinate place toward Jehovah the Most High God. Jesus always spoke of himself as the one that God his Father had sent. He was God’s Sent One or Apostle, and in this capacity he was “the Apostle and High Priest of our profession”. (Heb. 3:1) He did not in any shame hide the fact that he is the one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sent</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and thus is inferior to God his Father who sent him. When he washed his'disciples’ feet, he commented: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.” (John 13:16) Being sent of God, Jesus was not greater than his Father the Sender; neither was he as great.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. —Gen. 22:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There was, to begin with, a sinless world; and God’s purpose is to have a sinless world in which mankind will live forever in blessedness. That such is his purpose he disclosed in the above promise to Abraham. Among other things, that blessing meant that God would justify or declare free from their sins persons of all nations that would show faith in him like Abraham’s. Commenting upon that promise Paul the apostle says: “The scripture foreseeing that by faith God would declare the nations righteous fore-announced the good news unto Abraham, saying—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ail the nations shall be blessed in thee.&quot;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Gal. 3:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> But before this blessing of righteousness through faith in God could come, mankind had to see they were all sinners in His sight, unable to purify themselves. To reveal this fact Jehovah God gave his law by the prophet Moses to Abraham's descendants. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In Eden as soon as Jehovah announced the Seed of his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that promised Seed became the One he appointed as the only hope of all mankind that would be born. That Seed alone would be God's instrument or servant to deliver the human creation from the vanity to which they were subject by descent from the condemned sinners Adam and Eve. Because the promise in Eden came from Jehovah God, and because the final fulfillment of it rests with him, Jehovah is the “God of hope” and is primarily the hope of all human creation for deliverance from the vain bondage of corruption into the glorious lasting liberty of sonship to God. Hence from the days of Abel, second son of Adam and Eve, Jehovah God has been the hope of all believing, faithful men and women.—Jer. 14:7,8, A.S.V. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1}/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Even David himself testifies that God moved him to speak prophetically by means of His holy spirit, for David confessed: “The spirit of Jehovah spake by me, and his word was upon my tongue.” (2 Sam. 23:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> The holy spirit did not in itself speak, as if it were a person, but this active force of God spoke by means of the intelligent person upon whom it acted. Thus God spoke by means of his spirit through such inspired person. The spirit or active force emanating from God is the means of transmission by which he conveys teaching, prophecy, or foreign-language powers to his receptive, obedient servants on earth. Just as the electrical impulses from the radio television station send out and project a moving vision upon the video screen of a far-off television set, the spirit of God could even more easily produce a vision before the eyes of his prophets on earth.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God gifted his creature man with the ability to write. By making markings on certain materials, as clay, stone, wood, skins, or paper, man could indicate the sounds of speech. In this manner not only spoken words could be recorded for future reading, but also unspoken thoughts, ideas and messages. The art of writing being his gift, God saw to it that it was used for His good purpose. The Holy Bible reveals him and his purpose toward mankind, and he caused it to be written that those who seek eternal life and happiness might get the needed information and instruction. The writing of his holy Word from time to time has produced all the inspired books of the sacred Scriptures, for “scriptures” means “writings”. In this sacred Record we read the commands he gave to certain men to do the writing of their part of it. What is written is used as a memorial to be read and rehearsed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

The shiners would be the intelligent, who succeed in turning many people to righteousness despite the low moral ebb of humanity at the time of the end. These workers for true righteousness must certainly be the ministers of Jehovah God and the earthly representatives of his princely Son on the heavenly throne, for they are likened to the sun and stars of God’s creation. They let his heavenly light concerning his Kingdom shine that they may turn the people to it and to God's righteousness. Man can serve only one master at a time.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who lower themselves to the animal level do not seek the spiritual food for the everlasting life in the new world. They think solely of this life and enjoying selfish benefits at the expense of God’s organization. They are like shepherds that fleece and sacrifice the flock to dress and feed themselves. No fear have they for the needs of others, but think of themselves first: “they have no qualms about carousing in your midst, they look after none but themselves.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Moffatt)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Desiring to be always on the receiving end, how could they be productive of anything for others’ blessing?

By accepting the benefits of his sacrifice “men of good-will” may gain eternal life on earth; and even the human dead will be resurrected to this gracious opportunity. Moses brought in a “ministration of death”. By the Ten Commandments and the rest of the law he carried on a “ministration of condemnation” so that all men stood condemned before God. Christ Jesus performed a ministry by which righteousness is gained, to everlasting life. He made it possible for his faithful body of followers to enter heaven and there be rewarded with incorruptibility, immortality, indestructibility.

Since he conscientiously copied Christ in his service to Jehovah God, we can take an example from him as a true apostle. His record shows he put no stumblingblock in anyone’s way. So his ministry cannot be blamed or found fault with. We, too, should be just as jealous as he and the other apostles and their fellow workers were for the good name of the ministry that God has entrusted to us through Christ, to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. We will try to so conduct ourselves in connection with it that we may put no obstacles in the way of others’ accepting that gospel of salvation. Offended ones should find no fault with us except it be as to our loyalty to the law of our God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses have an unusual privilege and responsibility. They accept it and are proud they are servants of the Most High God. They are diligently putting forth every effort to turn the minds of all honest men and women, no matter of what nation, kindred or tongue, to Jehovah God in true worship. It is their desire to see all righteously disposed persons singing the praises of Jehovah, in order that they may gain life eternal and live in the New World of righteousness, where peace and prosperity will be the heritage of the nations. Yes, they are determined, by His grace, to give proof of their ministry to many thousands more, who, on that account, will join with them in the grand song of praise to Jehovah among the nations.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has the answer to man’s question, “What must I do to be saved?” He has the answer more than in just having the true and reliable information upon the question. He has the answer because he is the only One that can supply the means to solve the 6,000-year-old problem of rescuing mankind from all the things that afflict us. He purposed this salvation for mankind not only to display his love and mercy but also to show that his purposes can never be defeated and that he holds the right to sovereignty over all the universe, including our earth, and that he has the full power to exercise his universal rulership. The declaration of his purpose from Eden onward was good news; it was gospel. It pointed forward to final vindication of his universal rulership and also to the complete salvation of all obedient men from the death-dealing effects of sin against God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That serpent upon the pole symbolized the heavenly One who was made to be a sin-offering for us, namely, Jesus Christ as a man. He himself said so. Thus he was symbolically associated with a signal pole, to picture how he would be made conspicuous as the Savior of mankind. All those dying from sin and condemnation must look to him with faith and acceptance of him in order for Jehovah God to free them from sin, condemnation and death. If we turn our faces and hearts away from him in complaining, disobedience and unfaithfulness, then no other means of salvation remains for us; only destruction. The apostle Paul warns us against this with these words: “Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.”-l Cor. 10:9. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A person that has oversight of a company of members of the “household of faith” should take pains to be an example in all respects, remembering he is caring not for his own things, but for God’s. Knowing he must at the last render an account to God his Master, he should do all his acts and deeds as to God, because he loves God and lovingly cares for what belongs to God. Before he is put into such a responsible place, he should have a record that recommends him. However, the command to conduct ourselves as stewards toward God and his people is directed to all Christians, whether apostles or not. Our last opportunity to lovingly act as such is here, especially since the final end of this wicked world-organization is upon us. Therefore Peter’s words to this effect strike </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> with particular force: “Now the end of all is near.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Son of God became a perfect man that he might taste death as a sacrifice and vindicate God’s promise as to the woman’s Seed and undo all the wicked work of that old Serpent the Devil by bruising the Serpent’s head. All those from among the human creation who were to become children of God were partakers of flesh and blood, and so to deliver them from the bondage to the corruption of death the Son of God must become flesh and blood also, but not subject to vanity and corruption. His death must be due, not to man’s inherited bondage to death and corruption, but to being bruised at the heel by the Serpent for his faithful integrity to God. To be a sacrificial death for the ransoming of enslaved mankind his death was that of a perfect man acceptable to God. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All mankind are paying the wages of sin, which is death. None can by his jwn means escape from the condemnation of death, because all are sinners. Their sinfulness is incurable by human means. Hence their sinfulness is symbolized in the Bible by the plague of leprosy. To show that all men must lend a humble and believing ear to the message of redemption through Christ’s sacrificial blood God’s law provided for the cleansing of an Israelite whom he cured of leprosy. The cured leper showed faith in a sacrifice by providing a trespass offering to be offereu by the priest at the temple. Its blood was touched to his right ear. Thus, too, any man wanting salvation from sin and death must lend a hearing ear, his right ear, as it were, to the ransom message. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not a self-degrading term for us to style ourselves as “slaves” of Christ. It shows humility. To confess ourselves as his “slaves” counts more with true Christians than fleshly connection with Jesus Christ. Such slavery to him is a life-giving service, and is what makes us Christian brothers. It is what puts us all upon the same level. Just like slaves, we have been bought, yes, bought by Jesus by the value of his precious blood shed under the most painful circumstances. “Just as a free man who has been called is a slave of Christ. You have been bought and paid for; you must not let yourselves become slaves to men.” (1 Cor. 7 : 22, 23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) Besides being bought by our Master Jesus Christ for his everlasting service, for which he gives us everlasting life, we have been taken captive by his love and have willingly surrendered ourselves to him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

How he could do this at such a distance as at the right hand of his Father in heaven is easier to understand now that we are in the atomic age, with its use of radio broadcasting, television, bouncing radar beams off the moon, etc. All these modern developments disclose to us how marvelous unseen forces can be directed by scientific minds knowing how to control them and having the means or equipment for it.

Today she is in a spiritually and morally diseased condition worse than ever in her history. In such a condition she could never be God’s organization. The trouble with her is, she does not walk in God’s wholesome laws and ways. She dominates this world and is as worldly as anv other part of it. She is soaked through with religious hypocrisy and holds to only a “form of godliness”. Because she does not have true godliness and its health-giving power she will die. She went out of the way of godliness for the sake of gaining all this world has to offer. For this she will lose her lire. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heh. 10:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We know what sin is. It is not just wrong in itself, but is a violation of God’s law and displeases him. His condemnation of sin is manifested in that he had his dear Son die as a human sacrifice to take the sin of the world away and make it possible for men and women to live in righteousness in the new world. The blood of his sacrifice sanctifies or purifies the believers from sin. This sacrifice was offered for those who inherited a sinful condition from Adam and who, to begin with, did not know what sin was, they being helplessly born in it and under its penalty of death. It was not offered for willful sinners once enlightened with the truth. It was offered for those wanting to forsake sin and be relieved of the burden of condemnation of sin and its penalty, death. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship.—Ex. 35:35, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bezalel and Oholiab could go ahead with what talents they may have had to some extent. But the primary thing that insured the successful building of the tabernacle as God wanted it was his spirit. Also they would find enough workers of ability to work with them. Almighty God would see to that by means of his spirit. To be sure, while Moses, Bezalel and Oholiab depended upon God’s spirit to help, they also exercised what judgment they were capable of to select persons who, to start with, had qualities adaptable for the work and which could be developed. Then as these followed instructions and put their abilities to work the talent that they built up for the work under his spirit became a gift. It did not come to them just of itself, miraculously. They had to put forth effort, follow instructions, and apply themselves, trusting in his blessing and spirit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ perfection was absolutely necessary if he was to act for removal of the sin of the world. At the ripe age of thirty he came to John who was immersing repentant Jews in the Jordan river. It provided depth of water for persons to be dipped under to picture how they died to their past sins and how they determined thereafter to follow a life in obedience to God’s will. Their sins were not actually removed by such water baptism. Something far more potent was necessary, and this was provided by the perfect man Jesus. When he came to John it was not as a repentant sinner. It was as one now consecrating to enier upon a course of sacrifice that would result in his death as a man. Animal sacrifices offered till then had not really met justice nor been powerful enough to take transgressions from mankind. Therefore Jesus came to John to symbolize his baptism into death. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Korah grew proud and thought himself as good as his cousins Moses and Aaron. He had ambitions to make himself a priest like Aaron and his sons. He charged Moses with having selfishly arranged for his brother to become high priest and Aaron with having grabbed the honor of the priesthood for himself and his family. Korah did not respect the dignity conferred upon Aaron and his sons by Jehovah, and did not show respect for Jehovah’s decision in these matters as the Judge. He challenged Jehovah’s appointments and rebelled at them. He determined to put Jehovah to the test as to who should be priest. He drew into his rebellion certain prominent members of the tribe of Reuben. Those who rebel against Jehovah’s Theocratic arrangements and instructions for his organization are following Korah’s rebellious example and are certain to perish as he and Lis company did. “Woe unto themI” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Today Jehovah’s witnesses go about preaching in the same manner as Jesus and his disciples. Let us not forget, this is not educating people merely for a way of life now. It is a lifesaving work, helping people of good-will into God’s way of salvation that conducts them to a happy, eternal future in the new world. Is any work more salutary, more productive of lasting good, more beneficial to the people and more pleasing to God and his Christ, than this? Do you want a share in it while it lasts? It means your own salvation as well as that of those whom you assist into the truth. (1 Tim. 4: 16) There is, then, every reason to keep your interest in the ministry high, realizing it is not the job exclusively of men in ecclesiastical garb. Jesus’ disciples were of the common, everyday people without college or seminarial education, and he taught them to preach, and to preach what really led to the salvation of the people. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He is faithful that promised.—Hei. 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When giving his first prophecy to man, Jehovah looked forward six thousand years. How it is to be fulfilled in our time is recorded in the Revelation, written more than sixteen hundred years after the book of Genesis and more than four thousand years after the first divine prophecy to man. Truly, Jehovah God does not forget his promises, but faithfully vindicates his word. As far as his own promises and works are concerned he says: “I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure; . . . yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.” (Isa. 46:9-11, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Surely, then, what he has told us he purposes to do in the thousand years next after he fulfills his first prophecy we can depend on coming to pass. He will give mankind a king for a thousand years. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Today the enthroned King Jesus Christ, with the “key of David”, and henc<sup>n</sup> with authority over all the interests of the Davidic covenant for the Kingdom, has unlocked the door for those who follow him. This open door signifies the opportunity to enter into the ministry of the gospel of the Kingdom by telling it out to others by all means of publicity. It is an open door set, not before only men, but before all members of Christ’s true church at this world’s end. The world over they put Christianity above nationalism and are cemented together with brotherly love, for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">brotherly love.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> They keep what he tells them to do and do not deny his name by going in for some worldly rcligio-political arrangement opposed to his kingdom.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 71: 6, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The true organization of Jehovah’s children who follow Christ as Master have held on to their hope and confidence in Jehovah from the very day of its birth, the day of Pentecost, when he poured down his holy spirit through Christ Jesus. Today, after nineteen centuries, it can still say the words of Psalm 71:6. A number of religious organizations in Christendom claim to have descended without a break from the original apostolic organization of the first century. But where do any of them demonstrate that apostolic devotion to Jehovah and reliance upon him? But the facts about Jehovah’s witnesses of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries prove them worthy and entitled to take up and repeat the psalmist’s words. They have stayed upon Jehovah, and their hope continues to be upon him through Christ. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy kingdom eome.—Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Though we declare that the nations will be destroyed by the “iron rod’ of Jehovah’s King at Armageddon, we are not nihilists and anarchists. We do not teach lawlessness and rebelliousness against constituted order and governments, no more than Jeremiah who foretold Jerusalem’s destruction. We exalt the right and supremacy of God and are warning the nations. We do not teach men to disrespect the man-made governments that have assumed responsibility for law and order over various territories. At the same time we are forbidden by God’s Word to teach men to worship the political institutions or to give them wbat belongs to God. We cannot bring politics into cur prayers to God and pray him to prosper and preserve the nations that he has foreordained to destruction. No, but we pray the prayer of Jesus’ sermon on the mount. Hence we now preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath made us able ministers.—2 Cor. 3:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In many parts of the world that have come under the power of great religious influence the authorities in power do not like to recognize Jehovah’s witnesses as ordained ministers, although they are commissioned of God as such. The authorities object because these ministers are different. They do not realize that one man cannot make another man a minister of God. Being a minister of God is by reason of His pouring out upon His servant the holy spirit from on high; and this outpouring the Most High God said he would perform upon those who love him in truth. His spirit motivates those who have made a consecration to serve him to preach the gospel, and it makes no difference whether those individuals be young or old. If the heart of each one is right and seeking righteousness and is fully devoted to the Lord God, he will be favored of Jehovah God with his spirit through Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. Now therefore fear the Lord.—Josh. 21f: 13, Ilf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As to the battle of Armageddon and its effect upon those who accumulate houses and lands but do not trust in God and in his Messiah, Isaiah 5 : 8, 9, 25 says: “Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! In mine ears said the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.” If necessary, the Lord could have the survivors of Armageddon and the faithful ancients whom he raises from the dead occupy such vacated houses and factories of which he dispossesses the wicked users at Armageddon. The thing now to do is for us to use up what we have in his service as gospel-preachers and let him take care of providing for the future. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.~Matt. 7:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Men who hear but do not do the things taught them do not want to hear any more, because they do not care to hear that they must obey God and must keep the words of his Son. Christendom is just that way. Hence the battle of Armageddon will prove her to be built upon the sands of Babylon and of. Rome, and not upon the unshakable rock of salvation. Christendom’s kingdom, or her predominant position on this earth, is short-lived now, ceasing at Armageddon. Because she gives no heed to Jehovah’s law, all her prayers for peace and prosperity fall upon deaf ears with God, and he will not change from his purpose to destroy her at Armageddon. His Word says not in vain : “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.”—Prov. 28: 9. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because Jehovah is his God, Jesus Christ the Son could minister to him as his high priest. A high priest worships the God to whom he offers sacrifices, just as Aaron the high priest of Israel did. A high priest is certainly not as great as the God whom he worships and to whom he ministers and offers sacrifice. The Son did not assume to be an equal of the Father by taking the office of high priest to himself, but he waited for his Father to swear him into the office. “No man taketh this honour unto himself, bat he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.” (Heb. 5: 4-6) Since it is forever that he is High Priest like Melchize-dek, Jesus in heavenly glory worships Jehovah as his personal God forever. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These selfish persons fail to see the real purpose God has in calling people to his organization, namely, to be fruitful in righteous works and to let the heavenly truth shine out. When, for the time that they have been among us, they ought to be producing, they contribute nothing to the spiritual good of the organization and fail to be shining lights in this dark world. They are as trees that, at the close of the fruit-bearing season, are found without fruit, showing they have missed their purpose and are as good as </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dead.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Palestine unproductive trees were cut down or uprooted to escape the tax on fruit trees. When uprooted, such fruitless trees became twice dead or doubly dead.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Together, both the spiritual remnant and the good-will multitude of mixed nationalities have now been saved from this world, like Israel of old from Egypt. In obedience to Jehovah God we have broken off from it, choosing to ohey God rather than men. But bodily we are still in this world, although we are not of it. Sc the same temptations continue to befall us as befell the Israelites in the wilderness. What temptations? Those named by the apostle, namely: lust after evil things; idolatry, together with eating, drinking and playing; fornication; tempting or making trial of Jehovah God; and murmuring. In this world of temptation a Christian should not think he is so steady in standing, but should always be on guard, keeping his self-control. Else, he will be overreached by Satan’s world and fall into destruction and never realize the future blessings of the new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus did not measure out the spiritual qualifications for apostleship to the women in the church. No, ne measured out that privilege and power to twelve men. They were favored with that gift of grace. To them and other mature men Christ Jesus measured out the privilege and responsibility of acting as teachers inside the congregation. He withheld this from women believers. To the men also he measured out the gracious gift of serving as overseers and assistants, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bishops</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">deacons </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as religionists mistitle them. The gracious gift of prophesying was measured out to the women as well as the men in the congregation. (Joel 2:28,29; Aets 21:8,9; 1 Cor. 11:5) Prophets were active in the early church; but today men and women, filled with the spirit, have the privilege of explaining to others the prophecies written. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

We cannot show proof of our appointment to this gospel work by displaying religious titles and pretentious robes and collars received from the Hierarchy and theological seminaries. But we can show proof of our Christian ministry by our consecration to God and by the works of publishing the gospel and aiding others to God’s way of salvation by Christ. Not the flattering titles from men count. The results count. By these we commend ourselves to the consciences of men in the sight of God. This way we do not waste God’s grace that has been bestowed upon us. We do our whole duty. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 1:3, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The first and early members of the Christian congregation were begotten again by God to a “living hope”, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the death state had an important connection with it. Peter's words make it most clear that the living hope is that of eternal life in heaven for them. He tells us that Jesus was not resurrected as the human creature that he once was, but was “made alive in the spirit”. (3: 18, X.S.V.; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Consequently Jesus is not a human King, but a heavenly King, a spirit King. The kingdom of the Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> for which we hope according to God's Edenic promise is a heavenly kingdom. The hope of the faithful congregation of Christ’s followers is to be associated with him in that kingdom.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Godliness with contentment is great gain.—1 Tim. 6: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Contentment means being satisfied with one’s lot or provisions, having enough to suit one, thus being independent and grabbing at no excuse to complain and find fault. The person who does not have godliness with contentment goes after other gain than what true devotion and service to God now brings. He goes after something selfish, something to his own personal advantage and enrichment. Persons who take up godliness but who let their minds grow corrupt are the ones who become discontented. How misguided they are, beclouded through selfishness, diseased mentally! They do not look to Jesus Christ, who summed up the “mystery of godliness”, to see what worthwhile gains he made both while being in the flesh and after being vindicated in the spirit. Why did he make such gain? Because he was contented while in the flesh, satisfied with the lot his Father provided for him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The vision represents the hirth of God’s kingdom by the bringing forth of his Son in the new capacity of acting King to rule amid the enemies. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> stands for God’s universal organization of holy creatures, of whom Christ Jesus is one, the Chief One. Due to the opposition and evil designs of the dragon and his seed, this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (or universal organization) was putting forth efforts and was in painful anxiety for the birth of God’s kingdom. At God’s due time for its birth the glorified Jesus in heaven was brought forth from the universal organization to assume the new office of King in the heavenly Jerusalem or Zion.

They respect the occasion and respect what it means by attending the celebration and observing what the anointed remnant do in obedience to the instructions of their Head. But they discern they arc not themselves anointed members of the body of Christ and are not baptized into his death nor called and destined to rule with him in his heavenly kingdom. They are seeking for everlasting life in human perfection on earth under that heavenly kingdom. For them to partake of the emblems would picture something that is not true respecting themselves.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Uy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">whole concern was to write to you on the subject of our common salvation.—Jude 3, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jude was writing to those called to God’s kingdom, which kingdom is not of this political, commercial, religious world. Hence the salvation has reference to that kingdom and is a salvation of those called to it. It is common, but not in the sense of being low-grade, ordinary, for the Kingdom is Jehovah’s capital organization through which he now rules the universe. The salvation is “common” in that it is shared equally and alike by all those in the group of called ones; it is shared in common by them all. So they are exclusively God’s kingdom class, and he has made them a nation separate and different from all the nations of this earth. For a “common salvation” they must have a “common faith”, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> they do have. (Titus 1:4) The “faith” is the sum of beliefs concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom as delivered to us by Jesus Christ and his inspired disciples. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 6:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That is why the apostle says that, if God permits us to progress in knowledge by opening up the meaning of the Scriptures, we will do so. If we hold on childishly to part knowledge, to elementary things of God’s Word, and balk against marching on to perfection of knowledge, it may result in time in something worse than standing still. Such selfish willfulness may end up in falling away. Whether a person likes it or not, he gets left farther and farther behind by the advancing light. He may thus come into a condition from which he cinnot be recovered, and which means destruction for him. The apostle warns against this, for that is a hopeless state in which to relapse. Why? Because it is the result of one’s own choice, though one knows better and is responsible to God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An understanding is one of the gains we make by applying the knowledge we receive from God’s Word. We study his Word, we get information and knowledge from it, and we put this to work. Then, because of his blessing, we see the results, and thus we get an appreciation and understanding of how God’s law and instructions operate. The ungodly do not gain such understanding, because they do not study and apply his Word. We cannot have a long and happy life if we are quarreling and fighting with our fellow Christians, our brethren. When we faithfully walk in Christ’s footsteps and put his teachings in practice, then we shall be at peace with our brethren. Our paths will be peaceful. We shall go in the way that means a pleasant life for each one of us. This makes easier our united expansion of God's work. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered. —Joel 2:32, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the death of Jacob, the founder of their nation through his twelve sons, Jehovah had been exclusively the God of the nation of Israel. But from Pentecost on the calling upon Him for salvation through his Seed was not to be limited to the natural members of the nation of Israel. Peter quoted God’s own prophecy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Whosoever</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (Acts 2:21) The broad expression </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">whosoever </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">opened the calling up to anyone of our race, Gentile as well as natural Jew. But now the calling by them must be done through his Seed, Jesus the Nazarene, whom God exalted from death to his own right hand and made to be Lord and Christ. None can find acceptance with God, which means salvation, unless they recognize his Seed, Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed King of the new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.—1 John 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us not imagine that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirits</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be tried are invisible spirit persons, for, were this the case, how would we be able to see and hear them so as to test them? Rather, by the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirits</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is to be understood messages or utterances that have some invisible inspiration behind them. Hence Revelation 16:13 pictures such spirits as issuing from the mouth. The messages or utterances that are circulated in the earth by “prophets” or spokesmen have some source of inspiration behind them, either God or the opposing demons under Satan the Devil. So, “do not believe every inspired utterance, but test the utterances to see whether they come from God, for many false prophets have come out into the world.” (1 John 4:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hence your life depends upon obeying this warning command and making the test of spirits, now. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For these people are murmurers, grumbling at their lot in life. —Jude 16, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lacking the godliness with contentment, which is a precious thing to gain, they grumble and betray a lack of faith in God's provision for his people. His ways do not suit them. They do not see such a thing as a Theocratic organization in which Jehovah by Christ appoints each one to places of service as He pleases. Naturally, then, they do not pay respect to the Supreme Judge, but find fault with their lot in life. As they cannot have their own way inside his Theocratic organization and because, in time, his holy angels put them outside, they complain and vent their spite on certain outstanding servants of the Lord God. Slaves to selfish desire and passions, they cannot break off following these. Not succeeding in finding satisfaction for these inside God’s faithful organization, they murmur, speaking abusively. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. —Rom. 6: 23, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We must cultivate this gift of eternal life. Not, of course, that we earn it. In that case it would no more be a gift but a due. Proving worthy of it is not earning it. We prove worthy of it by showing we will use eternal life properly if God gives it to us by Christ. Hence we cultivate the friendship of God and Christ. We devote our full attention, time, energy and faithfulness to the matter of making that gift our own. That is why before eternal life in the future comes sanctification now. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sanctification</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> means getting away from the slavery of sin that pays death, and so becoming separated to God’s righteous service. If we stick to this sanctification, the outcome will be eternal life as a gift from God. Our faithful service of righteousness does net earn eternal life for us but proves we are proper ones upon whom to bestow it. It is never forced upon the unworthy.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand.—Rev. 7:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus and his apostles set up no Levite group among Christians. Hence Christians do not take up tithes to support Levites or any other group of ministers. Among true Christians, witnesses of Jehovah, all are under a solemn vow of consecration, dedicating their lives to God's ministry, and this vow they have publicly symbolized by being baptized in water. God has recognized this consecration by putting his spirit upon those who pay their vow to him. Thus it is that, without any tithing arrangement for support, most of his witnesses have to work at secular occupations to provide the necessary things honorably in the sight of men and God. But this does not mean at all that they are not actually by vocation fully ordained ministers of God and under all the responsibilities of the ordained ministry. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have espoused you to one husband, that 1 may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.—2 Cor. 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After Peter and his fellow believers were espoused to Christ by the holy spirit at Pentecost, he was used in betrothing thousands of others that later believed and were baptized. His fellow apostles were also used thus that day and after, particularly because by the laying on of the hands of all these apostles the gift of the holy spirit was bestowed upon baptized believers. The apostle Paul speaks of himself as taking part in the betrothal work. He was anxious that the betrothed ones continue in virgin purity to one husband, keeping their ties holy toward him, that they might prove worthy of finally being joined with him in marriage. At this end of the world God promised to espouse the remnant of the bride class to his Son by the instrumentality of the holy spirit. They become the remnant of the seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> from and after A.D. 1918, as the facts show.—Rev. 12:17. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be counted worthy of the kingdom of God.—2 Thess. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses, being all of one mind, have cut through all national boundaries. Language has been no barrier to their unity. Religions, politics, the ideas that men have tried to instill in people’s hearts, have all been cast to the winds. There is no divisive force that can stand in the way of their having one mind, which mind is the mind of Christ. Regardless of the country in which any witness of Jehovah lives, he is all out for supporting God’s kingdom and preaching it. He is an ambassador for Christ in this respect. Being an ambassador in this old world and being at the same time no part of it, he certainlv is not opposed to the present earthly governments, nor will he ever try to fight against them. Nor should he. He has no reason to do so, for Jehovah God allows the governments to remain until he shows forth his power, at Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.—Deut. 6:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For the reason which Moses here gave, neither he nor the faithful prophets that followed him, down to Malachi, taught a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">trinity</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> or believed in any such thing. The -heathen nations of their times did teach various ideas of a trinity, but not Jehovah’s chosen nation. All his holy prophets warned his chosen people against adopting or compromising with any of the religious teachings of such heathen nations. Such teachings, including a so-called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">trinity,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> were false. They were “doctrines of devils”, inspired by wicked demons opposed to the one living and true God. Hence the apostles of Christ followed in the steps of the faithful prophets before them in likewise not teaching any such thing as a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">trinity,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> but to the very contrary. Today in the midst of the selfish struggle for world domination the time has come for God, Jehovah, to vindicate himself as to who he is and what his true and rightful position, power and authority are. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">signal to the nations.—Isa. 62:10, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s stirring command is evidently an assembly call. It is part of a prophecy of restoration and reconstruction of His people who are in a covenant to do his will. The prophecy had a miniature fulfillment upon God’s ancient chosen nation, the Israelites, after the land of Judah and Jerusalem had lain desolate seventy years while they lingered in exile in Babylon. It has its major and final fulfillment upon God’s devoted people in covenant relationship with him in these days, particularly since A.D. 1919. Hence the prophetic command is a divine promise that after His people experienced deserved disfavor from the Lord by their captivity in Babylonia they would be restored to their God-given land and would again delight themselves in his favor. So it has come to pass. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Work out your own salvation with fear.—Phil. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of believing wc dedicate or consecrate ourselves to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ, and we get baptized in water in order to confess openly our belief and consecration to Him. Up to this point we have met Jehovah’s requirements, but arc we now completely saved beyond all possibility of losing out and being destroyed? No; no more than the people whom Jesus and his disciples cured or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">saved</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> from their sickness and diseases or even death were saved to an eternal salvation. Those who have taken the afore-mentioned steps arc, of course, in a saved condition, but their salvation is not complete. They must remain in that saved state until the final test in order to make their saved condition eternal. They must make their eternal salvation sure by continuing to meet God’s requirements. If not, they will fall from their saved state in His favor and will be found fit only for destruction. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Use mammon, dishonest as it is, to make friends for yourselves, so that when you die they may welcome you to the eternal abodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:9, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Just before telling about the unjust steward Jesus told the parable of the prodigal son; and this son showed no wisdom or forethought in using his mammon which consisted of his part of his father’s estate. This prodigal pictured those who today are becoming the Lord’s “other sheep”. He spent his money in loose, extravagant living, making friends indeed, but friends that forsook him when his money failed or ran out. He finally found out he had to repent of his past unwise course and make a friend of his compassionate father in order to find a real home. (Luke 15:11-32) The father’s compassion went out to the repentant prodigal. This, and not any mammon, was what provided for the prodigal son a dwelling with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">real friend that would never forsake him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus had no fear of death at the instance of the Devil and his wicked seed. In obedience to Jehovah’s promise in Eden he yielded to being bruised at the heel by the Serpent. He knew that the Serpent, the Devil, could kill or inflict death only upon the human body, but had no power over his future life or soul. He feared Almighty God, who was able to raise him out of death. That God might be pleased to do so, he remained innocent and faithful to God to the cruel death at the hands of the Devil’s seed. But by his very death he proved himself worthy to be the victorious Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to bring to nothing the wicked Serpent, the Devil, who has always misused the power of death. Jesus Christ the Seed will undo all the death that the Devil has inflicted for centuries upon those choosing God’s free service. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.—Prov. 23:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the heart that keeps the ear open to receive more. It is through the ear that the heart or mind receives much information, enlightenment and instruction. This was very much the case in Bible times when copies of the Bible were long and hard to make and were not so plentiful, and when learning God’s Word depended greatly upon hearing it read aloud and preached upon. Much information gains entry to the heart through the ear, and there must be a proper reception of this information in the heart, before there is good fruitage from it. (Luke 8:11,15,18) Unless the good and honest condition of the heart keeps our powers of audition open and keenly sensitive to the divine Word, our ears will be as if heavy, dull of hearing. There will be no ready, interested reception of the message, and there will be no fruit from our heart. W 5/1</span></p>

The gain we make by means of holding fast our godliness through contentment endures, to eternal life in the new world. God took care of his Son Jesus when He sent him into this world. If he never left his Son alone but was always with him to care for him, then we can expect the same attention of God, for Jesus asked his Father to bless his followers whom he sends into the world. Having God’s care, we can be content. If we have food and also clothing and shelter to cover us, “we shall be content.” We do not want money. We want godliness with contentment, because this protects us from all the many kinds of evil which find root in the love of money.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> here means one who performs public duties toward God, serves the people, and works and exerts himself for the sake of the public good. Christ Jesus rendered such a public service in the interest of the people by presenting his perfect human nature as a sacrifice to Jehovah God. By such a sacrifice for mankind in general Jesus Christ was indeed a public minister or public servant, not in being a politician or a statesman of this world, but by being Jehovah’s High Priest to offer the only acceptable sacrifice to him that serves as an offset to human sins. By faith in his sacrifice anyone of the public who hears the good news and accepts him as God’s appointed High Priest for sins can have approach to God and be relieved of the condemnation due to sin and be brought into the relationship of son of God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And in like manner also the spirit assists our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as we ought; but the spirit itself intercedes with unspoken groans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 8: 26, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Owing to bodily imperfections, weaknesses and inclinations to sin, Christians groan or sigh deeply in themselves, because they desire to be free from sin and to do God’s will perfectly. But the hope that God by his spirit implants in their hearts helps them to bear up and not to be overcome with discouragement. The spirit thus helps our weaknesses or infirmities, counterbalancing the effect of these upon us. Our inward groans or sighs often remain unexpressed, foi we do not understand our situation and we are at a loss what to express. We want to pray, but exactly what to pray for under certain circumstances we do not know, and mere groans and sighing would not help. It is here that the spirit intercedes for us. IF </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1 He is a babe. But solid food is for fullgrown men. —Heb. 5:13, U, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not God’s will for us to remain babes in knowledge. For us to stay babes in this wicked world puts us at a disadvantage. It leaves us quite unable to protect ourselves against the deceptions of the servants of the Wicked One. It leaves us quite useless for spreading the knowledge of God’s Word to others. There is an urgent need for us to grow in knowledge. God’s Word was not written for babes, although persons who are babes in knowledge can be taught from his Word by patient teachers. If we keep on partaking only of the milk of foundation truths, it will check our mental growth and leave us babes in knowledge that can be rocked to and fro by the hands of the Devil’s servants. As babes we cannot enjoy the greater portion of God’s Word, whic'h he has written for our complete instruction in what is right and for our protection against what is injurious. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Notwithstanding the persecutions, we have the evidences of divine mercy, peace and love such as religious Christendom does not have. So the people of good-will flock to the side of Jehovah’s remnant. They too want to share in the good things he is showering down upon his .faithful remnant of “called” ones. Lovingly the remnant welcome these “other sheep” whom the Good Shepherd Jesus Christ the King hunts and gathers. Together, the remnant and these “other sheep” rejoice that God’s kingdom is now here and that shortly his King Jesus Christ will finish his rule amidst his enemies by wiping them out at Armagedaon. Thus, as one peaceful flock safeguarded by the Good Shepherd, the remnant and good-will “sheep” joy together in God’s love and mercy.

All these are “gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army”. Is this “the war of the great day of God, the Almighty”? Yes, the “day of Jehovah” attains its grand climax with His victory in this universal battle, at the “place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon”. To this place the demon-inspired utterances out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast and the false prophet gather the &quot;kings of the whole world” for battle against Jehovah’s King. -16:13-16, A.S.7. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To show our intentions are peaceful and beneficial to the nations and are not subversive, God has sent us as his ambassadors to them. In Christ’s time ambassadors were sent by one nation to another when war threatened or had broken out and one nation was menaced with defeat and destruction by another. In view of mankind’s enmity toward him Jehovah God sent his witnesses as his ambassadors on a good will mission and on an errand of divine mercy. As such he has given us a ministry of reconciliation' to God, and not one of subversion to promote political rebellion or to subvert constitutions and framework of worldly governments. Under this responsibility we go bearing the Kingdom message from house to house to the people and also to the world rulers. Our peaceful, godly mission spells salvation to all who hear the divine word. We exhort rulers, rather than subvert their rule. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The typical passover could no longer serve after A.D. 33 as a “shadow of good things to come”, because the good thing, the better sacrifice, Christ Jesus, had in reality come and had died as a foundation for the new world of righteousness. To longer celebrate the passover would be to attach more value to the shadow than to the reality, the substantial thing. It would show a lack of faith in the coming of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world. Hence persons that continue to celebrate the passover as of old are the ones that reject Jesus of Nazareth as the “better sacrifice”, “our sacrifice.” (Col. 2:16,17; Heb. 10:1; 9:23) To provide something in place of the annual passover supper, something that would turn their faith and remembrance in the right direction, Jesus instituted the new memorial. He instructed his followers to keep it regularly at the due time. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The sin of the world for which the Lamb was once sacrificed to remove it is not the sin of this world of which the Devil is the god and invisible ruler. His world will shortly be destroyed for its unforgivable sins against Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and against his kingdom by Christ. The sin of the world that is removable and that will be all removed by the Lamb is the sin of all those who will gain life in the righteous new world. The faithful Christians who now find acceptance with God for a place with Christ in his heavenly kingdom receive now the removal of sins through faith in his sacrifice. At death they cease from this sinful body of flesh. In the resurrection from the dead they are clothed upon with spirit bodies of perfection that they may sit down with him in his throne.

So they look around, single out persons, make a show of admiration for them, and try to cultivate their favor and support. It is rot sincere, but is done with hope of some gain, materially or socially. Their seeking advantage by means of a fellow creature blinds them to the higher aim of cultivating the favor of the Creator and Giver of life. In this day of judgment they fail to pay the deserved respect to the great Judge who can award life or destruction. For this failure they shall perish. If we love and respect the Judge, seeking the promised life eternal at His hands, we will be on watch against these doomed ones and give them no encouragement. We will contend against them in wholehearted defense of the faith, for the vindication of the great Judge of all. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

To enter at last into the gift of eternal life on earth, men and women of good-will must serve righteousness duiing his reign. People of good-will now devote themselves to service of God’s kingdom. They have in view gaining his gift of eternal life on earth. If he spares their lives through the battle of Armageddon they must continue to do his will to the end of Christ’s 1000-year rule, the same as the others of mankind who will be raised from the graves. In that case they will never die but continue living in perfection on earth. There will be a final test of the fixedness of men’s devotion when Satan the Devil is released for a time from his millennial imprisonment. All who then resist his seductions to rebel against God and his King will be justified to the gift of eternal life in the earthly paradise.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort.—Ps. 71: 3, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Survival of his witnesses to this postwar year, with thousands of persons of good-will associating themselves with them, proves Jehovah has been a sure refuge for them. He has not let them be put to shame nor let their trust in him be disappointed. In righteousness he has delivered them from their foes and rescued them from the threatened extermination. He has bowed down his ear to their cries amid persecution by combined enemies. He has saved them for the further witness he wants given on earth before Armageddon. They are a living example of the truth, that men and women of faith who resort continually to Jehovah as tneir God of worship will find him to be a “rock of habitation”. They can use the psalmist David’s words to Jehovah: “Thou art my rock and my fortress. Thou hast given commandment to save me.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Since all nations and families of the earth are promised to be blessed in the Seed of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Seed of Abraham, this Seed is the One that Jehovah God has appointed in whom all the nations, including those of A.D. 1949, must hope. Who is that Seed of hope? It is a descendant of Abraham through Jesse’s son. King David of Jerusalem. For that reason he is called “the Son of David” and is the heir of the everlasting throne and kingdom that Jehovah promised to fix in the royal line of David. It was not left for crooked politicians and worldly religious priests and clergymen to identify who this Seed of Abraham and Son of David is. By his inspired witnesses God identified the Seed. So there is no room for uncertainty ; Jesus Christ, the Son of David, is the Seed for blessing all the nations and in whom all the nations must hope. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not being for this old wicked rule that exists in all the nations. but being for the kingdom of God, Jehovah’s witnesses are not divided as are all the religious bodies throughout the world. The people of all the different religions in the various lands, being of different nationalities and political connections, are divided against one another. This state is not found among those consecrated to Jehovah as God. They are one organization, no matter where they reside. Difference of speech does not hold them apart. Customs do not divide them. Even the governments over them do not matter. It makes no difference what form of government may rule over them, it is not allowed to stand as a barrier to Jehovah’s witnesses in unitedly serving the Almighty God. They are not of this old world, but are for God’s kingdom. In this way they are different, not conformed to this world. —Rom. 12 : 2. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, . . . laying up in store for themselves a good, foundation against the time to come.—1 Tim. 6:17,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our wisdom lies, therefore, in treating mammon or riches, not as our master whom we slavishly serve, but as our servant useful in God’s work, just as the God-fearing centurion Cornelius did. (Acts 10: 1-4) We do not need to go into real estate deals now in order to provide houses and lands for the use of ourselves and of others in the new world that lies beyond the battle of Armageddon. Jeremiah was in prison right in Jerusalem when it was under siege by the Babylonians; yet Jehovah preserved him when the city fell, and saved him from its destruction. (Jer. 39: 11-18) He had the Lord’s protection although in the very midst of danger and thus he was really safe, contrary to all outward appearances. Hence places of retreat to withdraw to in order to escape the trouble engulfing the world are not necessary as long as we keep faithful in God’s service: “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 15: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a servant, an apostle and a disciple of Jehovah God the great Teacher, Jesus Christ tried to please his heavenly Father, his Life-giver. By this course he denied equality with his Father. It was in order to please his Father with perfect obedience to the death that Jesus submitted to being lifted upon a torture stake by his enemies. (John 8:28,29) He had someone greater than himself to please, namely, his heavenly Father. The One whose reproaches he bore as a servant was separate and distinct from Jesus, just as our Christian neighbors whom we are exhorted to please are individuals different from ourselves. Hence the apostle uses Christ’s course of not pleasing himself as a reason for saying to us: “Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.—Prov. 20:12, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To have the hearing ear which Jehovah God produces means to have an ear for His Word written or proclaimed. It means to have a sense of hearing that is disposed to listen to what his Word says in order to get at its meaning and then to accept it for what it is worth. To give an ear requires us to have faith, to have a love of righteousness, and to be humble and sincere. Yes, to accept the gospel and act upon it we must have faith in its Sender, Jehovah God, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed to be the Ruler of the new world of righteousness. We must believe in Jehovah’s loving purposes toward us and in his truthfulness. We must believe in his full ability to do everything he says in his Word. We must believe he will reward us if we accept his Word and act in accord with it. Thus we show faith.—Heb. 11: 6. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 16:31-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Their believing in God and in the Lord Jesus did not mean merely entertaining some ideas about God and Jesus in their minds, as right ideas. Believing meant committing themselves or giving themselves over in full dedication to God through Jesus Christ. So, now, to symbolize or testify openly to this dedication or consecration of themselves to God through his Seed the Lord Jesus, the pagan convert and his household were baptized in water. Either the apostle Paul or Silas did the baptizing. (1 Cor. 1: 13-17) Their immersion under water symbolized their death to themselves and to the pagan gods that they had worshiped before. Their being raised up out of the water to a new course of life pictured their being alive henceforth to the living and true God who had forgiven them their sins through the Seed of his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W lj/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 John i:l, A.A..T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The demons inspire utterances that lead men into opposition to God and down to destruction. So, when you test an utterance from the mouth of the Devil’s dragon organization, or from the mouth of the “beast”, his visible organization, or from the mouth of the political combination acting as “the false prophet”, you can be sure that such prophecy is demoninspired; it is an unclean spirit or inspired utterance. (Rev. 16:13,14) None of such three “spirits” are of God, for not one of such spirits or inspired utterances agrees with the spirit or inspired utterance from God. The testing of them by God’s written Word proves it. All persons who use the Bible as the touchstone to try the spirits will safeguard themselves against deception and will preserve their eternal interests.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16,17, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The loaf of unleavened bread symbolizes the “body of Christ”, of which Jesus is the Head. By partaking of the Memorial loaf the anointed remnant today show their oneness with him and their participation with him in his afflictions and reproaches. On the day of Pentecost those who are members of the body under Christ Jesus were pictured by two loaves of wheat bread which the high priest offered at the temple, two loaves being used to show that the church would be made up of two general classes, namely, Jews and Gentiles. But at Memorial the one loaf pictures the unity of all body-members with one another and with their Head Jesus Christ. (Lev. 23.15-21; Acts 2:1) Since the bread and wine denote the same thing, Christ’s death, the two emblems are properly served together. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All those associated together in a company of Christians, all those full-time Kingdom publishers sent out in groups into special territories or into foreign lands and who must work together, should get along in peace with their fellow workers. That is the course of contentment. It brings satisfaction. There are some who crave controversy. They would rather fight than be pleasant. Some like to wrangle over words. They believe in argumentation rather than in practice. They do not realize that God’s service comes before their fights. Others like to slander and find fault and start gossip. None of these are contented. They could not be when following such a course of conduct. Oh, they may point to their record of service in the field as their godliness. But even at that, there is no real, inward gain to such ones, no real profit to them, for they are not contented. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The true and living God has his true ministers, and these are the ones that all those who seek God and his way to eternal life want to have. The Pattern against which all others claiming to be God's ministers are to be measured is, in all points, Jesus Christ, for he was and is God’s Chief Servant and, when on earth, he called upon men to follow him. He is God’s High Priest, not by being born into the family of Aaron the Levite and thus inheriting priesthood from Aaron the brother of Moses. No; but by God’s oath he was made High Priest like the ancient priest-king named Melchizedek: “But this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord [Jehovah] sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.” (Heb. 7:21,22) Jesus was therefore a better high priest of God than Aaron was. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The very fact that Paul would call him “Christ our passover” required that Christ Jesus should be sacrificed on the identical day upon which the Jews slew and ate their passover lamb, namely, the fourteenth day of Nisan. By God’s providence, the One rightly spoken of as the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (Rev. 13:8) was slain in the flesh on the very same day that the Israelites slow their passover lamb and ate it together with unleavened bread A.D. 33. The “Lamb of God” had to die that same day of the passover sacrifice in order that he might act the part of the true passover Lamb whose blood has value enough to cancel the sin of all those of mankind who believe and accept him as their sin-offering. The Memorial which he also set up that day is a Memorial of the founding of the new world in which God’s kingdom will hold control for blessing all obedient humankind.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The red wine symbolizes blood poured out, namely, death. It here represents Christ’s death, by which he proved his integrity and faithfulness to God and by which also he paid the ransom sacrifice. By drinking the Memorial wine the remnant proclaim they are baptized into Christ’s death and that they bear about in their fleshly bodies the dying of Christ, and that they are thus having a common participation in his death for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It does not mean that they have a part in the sin-offering or share in providing the ransom sacrifice. Jesus only is the ransom sacrifice; he only can provide and has provided the sin-offering. But the communion in the reproaches, afflictions and death of Christ is something that has beer given by God through Christ to the 144,000 members of his body as a privilege. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Fanners who cultivate ground only to have it later bring forth thornbushes and briers burn over such ground and scorch it with fire. The enlightened person that relapses has destruction like that awaiting him. Jehovah God, Christ Jesus, and the organization of light have spent much work upon this re-lapser, but now he no more brings forth good fruit in response to such goodness; he brings forth fruit like the rest of the world. However, he is more reprehensible than the world, for better things were due and to be expected from him. He is accursed. His end could be only destruction. So, if any have grown careless and indifferent, the thing for them to do is at once to pull themselves together, renew their efforts to move ahead in the light and its service, and not lose the good reward for all they did in the past. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By a sham gospel the adversary wilily tries to adulterate our faith and confuse us and make us be conformed to this world’s beliefs and ways. He makes it his business to add to or take away from God’s written Word so as to bring contradiction into it, confuse our understanding, and turn us to the philosophies of unbelieving “wise men” of this world. There is but the one gospel which was once for all delivered to God’s holy people, the one delivered in purity by the Lord Jesus Christ and his inspired apostles and disciples. Hence the way for us to contend for the true faith is to hold fast to that original gospel in its purity; to go back always to it in cases of doubt or dispute; and to measure any new, foreign suggestions by means of it as the canon. Go back to the written Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Inclined to imitate Sodom and Gomorrah in sex debauchery, these filthy intruders try to carry their practice into the Christian congregation, God’s temple. These, who bore from within, do not fear Jehovah, Sovereign Lord of the universe. They do not realize they are dealing with the true organization of the living Jehovah. Either that or else they do not care, for they “despise dominion”, “lordship they set aside.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No desire moves them to share with God’s people in viryiicating his universal sovereignty by obeying him and keeping integrity to him even under persecution. They set aside the fact that Jehovah is the Owner and Master of his organized people and that he has appointed it to be pure. He will not let it be converted into a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah fit only for destruction.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of being called to the apostleship, Paul was gifted in many ways. It was the invisible energy of God that operated through him. There was doubtless some natural foundation for his being used in the way he was. There was something already in him upon which the spirit or active force of God could work, something it could develop to larger uses. Of course, this does not mean it was all natural ability on his part. No; but first God had to show him mercy, a one-time persecutor. God next called him and opened to him the opportunity to serve, and then bestowed the all-necessary spirit upon him. Had it not been for this, he could not have been used as he was, despite all the natural ability that he had as a Jew. Therefore Paul gives the due credit to God’s spirit upon him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That all nations might make Jesus Christ their hope, Paul went preaching among the Gentile nations. To back up his preaching to these non-Jews he quoted Isaiah 11: 10, saying: “And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule over the nations; on him shall the nations hope. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the holy spirit.” (Rom. 15:12,13, A.S.V., margin) Manifestly Christendom’s clergy do not obey God’s command by Isaiah nor do they follow the apostle Paul’s example. In this world crisis they declare the hope of the world to be some man-made makeshift for God’s kingdom by Christ. God will not fill such religionists with all joy, peace and abounding hope, for they do not believe in Jehovah’s appointed Servant, “our hope.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.—1 Sam. 15:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Adam was selfish and rebelled against God. He disobeyed God’s plain command that would have led to life eternal, and became the worshiper of a demon, the Devil. If, by disobedience to Jehovah God, Adam became a god, it was by setting himself up to be worshiped by himself. He no longer looked to his Father in heaven as the great Life-giver, to whom he owed everything. Because he was still alive after sinning against Jehovah, he may have thought he would be able to maintain his life. He idolized himself or worshiped himself. This is indicated by the stubborn course of action he took in disobeying God. From that time on stubborn man has substituted images in the form of mortal men, birds, animals and reptiles, to which to give his worship. Man thinks a lot of himself, and he thinks he is able to do something that God says he alone will do. So man goes on indulging in futile speculations. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thus it is written.—Luke 24: 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The purpose that writing has according to God’s will is to use the book written as a memorial that could be read and reread aloud and rehearsed in the ears of others. It can be used as a vindication of the speaker whose words are recorded, and as a testimony against enemies and false accusers. No one has been reproached and maligned more than Jehovah. But he has had committed to writing a faithful declaration of his works and good purposes, and the day draws near when his Word will be fully vindicated once and for all time. Had the knowledge of God depended upon oral tradition to be transmitted to man’s descendants, it would have been more and more corrupted, added to or taken from, so as to make it largely unreliable. But because it has been faithfully preserved in writing for a memorial, a truth seeker can satisfy himself with an authentic, trustworthy account about his Creator. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 3:16, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Three and a half years after Jesus’ resurrection Jehovah God sent Peter the apostle to preach the good news to the Gentile nations. There was a response by the Gentiles to this expanded preaching, and consequently Jesus Christ “was believed on in the world” as well as “proclaimed among nations”. Finally, A.D. 1914, he was “received up into glory” by being placed upcn the heavenly throne to act as “King of kings” for Jehovah God, to rule in the midst of his enemies. This glorious elevation of him was pictured prophetically at Revelation 12: 1-5. Since then the preaching of this good news of the Kingdom has been expanded to all nations, to fulfill Jesus’ own prophecy on how to recognize the near end of this world: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.”—Matt. 24: 14. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On this day Jesus puts Satan and his angels out of heaven and down to the earth, God’s footstool. But he does not at once bind Satan and start his own thousand-year reign of peace and freedom from Satanic interference. No, this preliminary reign of Jesus is as King David’s forty-year reign of warfare that preceded the peaceful reign of David’s son and successor, King Solomon. During this “day of Jehovah” the remnant of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman’s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> seed must be assembled and be set to work preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”, and the “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep” must be gathered. (12:17; 7:9-17) All this takes time. Also it must be done amid the opposition and persecution by the abased Satan and his angels, in order to test the integrity and devotion of the remnant of the seed and of the great multitude. This is why Satan and his demons are left unbound. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A child on reaching the age of intelligence and appreciating God’s requirements can obtain the privilege of the ministry by making a vow of consecration to God with full faith in Christ Jesus as our ransom sacrifice and our Exemplar. Today many boys and girls not yet in their teens, when not at public school, are preaching the gospel from house to house and also distributing the Kingdom message in print on sidewalks and other public places. When God accepts anyone’s consecration and puts his spirit upon him, he subjects such accepted one to all the obligations of His minister and he becomes an ordained minister of the gospel and must discharge the duties of his office. The Bible is the rule for his conscience. It provides him the subject matter for preaching. From then on his obligation is to render a faithful ministry and prove God true and Satan the false accuser a liar. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 1:17, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God was the only one to possess immortality originally. Infinity of existence belongs to him: “from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” (Ps. 90:2) Because he is thus from eternity to eternity, he can have honor and glory ascribed to him “unto thf ages of ages”, or for all eternity to come. His being incorruptible denotes his immortality, that is to say, his indestructibleness, his imperishableness, the impossibility for him to decay or waste away. Because he is from everlasting or from all past eternity, hence without beginning, he stands out alone above every other intelligent person in the universe, without even the exception of his beloved “only begotten Son”, the Messiah. It is because all these others are creatures, Jehovah’s creations. Being immortal in all past eternity, he is the source of all life everywhere. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 15:12, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Isaiah’s prophecy served both as a divine command to the apostle Paul who quoted it and as a guide to his course of action. In thus taking part in fulfilling the prophecy and making Jehovah’s great royal Signal prominent he tells us he preached the gospel “publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ”. (Acts 20: 20) We likewise today, in taking part in the final and complete fulfillment of the prophecy commanding us to ‘raise the Signal to the peoples’, do so by preaching the Kingdom gospel to all the habitable earth for a witness to all peoples, &quot;publicly, and from house to house,” in imitation of the apostle Paul and of his great Leader, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall come to his end, and none shall help him. And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for . , . thy people.—Dan. 11:45; 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheep</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> with hearing ears stay absolutely neutral toward the fight between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”. The Good Shepherd has taught them it is not their responsibility to save this world from Godless communism. Both such “kings” are of this world, and it is not the sheep's Christian obligation to save one part of this world from the other part of it. To follow the Shepherd they must keep clean from this polluted world and must be entirely for God’s kingdom and its Prince who stands for the children of God's people. The sheep know that the true Christ will destroy both of those composite “kings” at the battle of Armageddon. So they try to increase the interests of Christ’s kingdom, and not those of any worldly religious-political party. They safeguard themselves against the false Christs. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Faith in Jehovah’s Seed, namely, Jesus Christ, is necessary to salvation. He is the promised Prophet who would be like Moses and he is also the Seed of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth will be blessed. (Acts 3: 6,16-26) It was the power of Jehovah God that made the name of Jesus Christ important, possessed of power for salvation. Jehovah did not link the name of any other creature with the name of his Seed, neither the name of Mary nor that of Mohammed. Peter said that under heaven there was no other name given by which to be saved; and it is contrary to Peter’s words of inspiration to add other names as necessary to salvation. All those seeking eternal salvation must, therefore, call upon Jehovah and must do so through and in the name of Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit is that which testifies, because the spirit is the truth. For there are three which testify; the spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three are of one.—1 John 5:6-8, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">water</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> refers to God’s Word that Jesus preached. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">blood</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> points to his death as a human sacrifice. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was the invisible energy with which he was anointed. The water, blood and spirit agreed in bearing witness to the fact that “Jesus is the Son of God”. The spirit with which he was anointed came froir his Father. That being so, then it was God who, by means of his spirit, was giving witness respecting his Son Jesus Christ. The blood that Jesus had in his human organism on earth testified he was God’s Son, because his human birth was not by man’s begettal but by the life-giving power of Jehovah God. Most of the Word of God was written before Jesus’ human birth, and all this Word of God also testified that the Christ would be the Son of God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The truth of Jehovah endureth for ever.—Ps. 117:2, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God sees this world as it does not see itself. For many centuries he let the nations go on in their ignorance of the root of their trouble, following their own chosen forms of religious worship. But in his due time he began sending all the nations the truth not only about their common condition but also about the way of relief he has lovingly provided. His truth is simple and plain-spoken, because simplicity and straight talk is for the earliest benefit of those needing help. His truth absolutely agrees with the facts. It has been written down for consultation by all. As the Creator of mankind, he is also the Great Physician and can accurately probe the cause of mankind’s trouble and also prescribe the only cure-all for them. This he has done, and countless numbers of people till now have benefited by following his prescription. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If we choose to go on sinning after we have so fully learned the truth, there is no sacrifice left to be offered for our sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:26, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole purpose of God’s grace is to get us away from sin and its disabilities and into his righteous service for the vindication of his name. Consequently if anyone has gotten a knowledge of the truth from God’s Word and acts upon it in appreciation of the spirit of grace that inspired it, he sins willfully if after a while he turns back to the world and a regular practice of sin. He now takes un a course in sin of his own free choice, and not tor being born in it by descent from Adam. By the blood of the new covenant he had been made free from the disabilities descending upon him from Adam’s sin; and so Adam is not responsible for the willful person’s new course in sin. Christ’s sacrifice was not offered for any willful courge in sin. Why, even the enlightened, willful sinner does not want its benefits any more. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the holy spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">-^Jude 20, 21, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It takes faith to please God. To build ourselves up and grow stronger in the most holy faith we have to study the Bible, getting more familiar with it and gaining a better understanding of it, being more and more convinced of its truth. To this end we will use all the Bible helps God has provided for us through his organization. All the meetings and assemblies for studying and discussing his Word together with our brethren we will regularly attend. We will deepen the impression his Word makes upon our lives by serving it to our brethren and going forth to the people in world distress to proclaim it to them. By this course we shall be made more able to “contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints”. This makes God love us more. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Attend to your Scripture-reading, your preaching, and your teaching, till I come. Attend to these duties, let them absorb you, so that all men may note your progress.—1 Tim. 4:13,15, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The thought is, to set a good example in the congregation of God’s people; and, when others see your progress in the right way, they will imitate you. They will see the advantage of studying and teaching the Bible. They will note your godliness marked with great gain and contentment. By your course of life they will set you are wholly satisfied and contented. That is what Paul wanted to see in the case of Timothy; namely, his progress in the Lord’s work, the expansion of his ministry, and not his just standing still. Never should we neglect the study of the Scriptures, but keep our minds on the law of God. By doing so, we are gainers, because this course brings us a long and happy life with abundant prosperity. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! when a trumpet is blown, hark!—Isa. 18:3, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The association of a trumpet with the great Signal is also shown us at Matthew 24:29-31. The proclamation that Jehovah causes to be made to the end of the earth concerning this Sign is like a tremendous trumpet-blast to get the people’s attention and to signal to them to gather to the Fixed Sign. In the final fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy in our day Jehovah is the great Sovereign who raises up the Signal. Jehovah makes him to stand up in power on top of the lofty kingdom or capital organization symbolized by Mount Zion of ancient times. His setting up of the Signal took place A.D. 1914 at his bringing of Christ Jesus forth as acting King and enthroning him in heaven. This was symbolically foretold to us at Revelation 12:1-5 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.),</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> where we read: “And a great sign was seen in heaven.” Then the birth of the Kingdom occurs. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man hath received the gift, even so minister . . . of the ability which God giveth.—1 Pet. 4:10,11.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not expect any miraculous gifts of the spirit today. This does not mean there are today no gifts of the spirit. There are, but these gifts must be cultivated by our bumbly accepting the privileges of serving God that are given us and then putting to use any ability and fitness for the service we have. “As the Scripture says, ‘God opposes haughty persons, but he blesses humble-minded ones.’” (Jas. 4:6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.) As we</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> humbly and trustfully present ourselves to the service and go about it with wbat we possess, God blesses and helps us by his active force or energy and we find we are equal to this work and getting it done. We find we have the gift. Do not permit your gifts to suffer neglect, no matter how small they be. Keep them constantly in use. Stir them up; rekindle the fire of them. Redeem the time and its opportunities. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let a man so account of us, as of . . . stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man he found faithful.—1 Cor. If: 1,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For Paul to peddle out these divine mysteries in such a way as to gain personal material and social benefit to himself rather than to benefit his heavenly Master’s interests would be unfaithfulness. It would be squandering the gift bestowed upon him by Jehovah God, because it would bring reproach upon God’s name. Paul disclaimed any commercial benefit or financial profits from his work. (2 Cor. 2: 17) He was not here recommending himself; his works and their fruitage did that for him. But he was showing himself prepared to stand before God and answer to any false accusations against him. No one could rightly accuse him of being an unjust, dishonest, unfaithful steward, disloyal to his trust. For this reason Paul could say to his readers: “Become imitators of me, . . . even as I also am of Christ.”—1 Cor. 4:16; 11:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diag. W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Deborah was Rebekah’s nurse. (35:8) She appears to picture persons of good-will toward Christ who preceded his death, resurrection and ascension to heaven, the faithful ones from Abel to John the Baptist. Many of these ancient persons as prophets performed a ministry which proved to be in behalf of Christ’s bride class. (1 Pet. 1: 10-12) Many of this class will be made “princes in all the earth” as visible representatives of Christ during his 1000-year reign after Armageddon. By being resurrected due to the virtue of his ransom sacrifice they will become his earthly children. (Ps. 45:16) Deborah’s presence at Rebekah’s marriage suggests that those to be princes will be raised from death and be brought in personal contact with the remnant of the bride class before these finish their life in the flesh and join Christ in heaven. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11 /I</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I ivill put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.—Gen. 3:li,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Peter 2:12 speaks of the lower animal creation as “natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed”. So, for the Serpent to be cursed of all beasts, or be the most cursed of them, meant certainly he would be caught and destroyed. The further fact that he would eat dust meant the same thing, that he would be reduced to death, the same as for the sinner Adam to return to the dust from which he was taken meant death and destruction for him. How such death was to be brought upon the Serpent was explained to be by bruising his head, and this by the Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bruising the heel would be only a seeming triumph for the Serpent and would in reality seal his doom, for the bruising would be a crime far exceeding in enormity the Serpent’s wicked sin in the garden of Eden. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes . . . After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations.—Rev. 7: 4,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the purposes for which God shortened the tribulation in 1918 and spared the remnant of the elect was that these might bear the divine message of salvation to this great multitude who are to be saved to eternal life on earth. So, since 1918, God’s prolonged endurance of the worldly nations doomed to destruction has worked to a twofold effect, namely, the salvation of the remnant and that of the great multitude. God holds back the destructive forces that are reserved for Armageddon until after this multitude gets the benefit of the Kingdom gospel proclaimed by the remnant. Whereas the remnant are sealed in their foreheads with the seal of the living God, the multitude are marked in their foreheads by the remnant as worshipers of Jehovah and supporters of his King.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.—Isa. 43:10, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who worship the Supreme One of all the universe believe that Jehovah God alone is the Sovereign God and that all worship, honor and glory are due him. They believe he is the great Source of life and is able to save all who come to him with humble hearts. Those who have come to the Lord God and accept his Word and who abide by it are blessed of God, and they become his witnesses. Men and women from all parts of the earth, from all nations, kindreds and tongues, have thus come to the Lord God because of a study of his Word, and have accepted his Word as truthful and right and are abiding by it. They appreciate that in Isaiah 61: 1-3 a commission is set out for those who consecrate themselves to serve God as followers of his Son. They know that this message which they are commissioned to preach offers comfort and hope to all nations of the earth. They stand firm for the preaching of it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let this disposition be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, though being in God’s form, yet did not meditate a usurpation to be like God.—Phil. 2: 5, 6, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Unlike Satan the Devil, the enthroned Jesus Christ does not use his Kingdom power to try to make himself equal with God or “like the Most High”. Before he became a man, he did not try to usurp Jehovah God’s power and place, neither will he attempt a usurpation now that he has ascended up to the heavens to God’s right hand. This is proved by what is foretold to take place at the close of his reign after he destroys all the foes of Jehovah God and of man: “And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.” (1 Cor. 15:28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Thus, to the contrary of trying to put Jehovah God under his feet and usurp his power, Christ Jesus excepts or makes an exception of Jehovah God, and at the end of his reign he subjects himself. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To all those finally saved the message of salvation must come, whether audibly by means of the auditory nerve or visually by means of printed page or sign language. All those who do the presenting of the message by word of mouth or by delivery of the printed page are “preachers” or proclaimers. After that it is up to the one to whom the message is presented to “hear” it, that is, accept it into a good and honest heart with humility, faith and obedience. So it becomes plain how important the work of preaching is. Preaching leads to hearing, and hearing to salvation. For this reason no other activity on earth is more important to mankind than preaching, regardless of how the worldly-wise may view the matter. In response to mankind’s need to hear the saving news, God has ordered preachers into the field. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Before not very long this special time of privileged service in God’s sight will be over, once the final war of Armageddon is past. Appreciating the matter in this day of salvation, we are determined to do as the apostle Paul said, namely, “finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.” (Acts 20:24) Paul did not look upon any big trialsome experience as being the final test of his integrity after which he could take it easy and stop ministering. No; but when in prison at Rome., while it seemed he had finished his course, yet he called for Timothy to bring him “the books, but especially the parchments”. He wanted to do more work while in prison till the end came in God’s time for him. They could hold him bound in prison, but could not stop him from preaching even there. In his case it was true, “the word of God is not bound.”—2 Tim. 4:13; 2:9. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s “other sheep” have good prospects of eternal life before them. Their hope is one of life unending on this earth brought to a global paradise condition by the kingdom of Jesus Christ with his called ones. God’s kingdom is the means for blessing them. Their salvation is dependent upon the Kingdom. The King Jesus Christ died to save them as well as his little flock of called ones, for “he is himself an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the whole world”. (1 John 2:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> This is a salvation which the Devil begrudges them. He is now trying to cheat them of it. Their salvation is a precious part of the faith once for all delivered to the saints in the apostles’ day, and it must be unremittingly contended for until the prize is gained by these “other sheep”.—Jude 3. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When declaring his godly separateness from this world, Jesus thus testified to Governor Pilate. He was manifested in the flesh for the purpose of bearing witness to Jehovah God and his kingdom. On coming into this world, even to his brethren according to the flesh, it was highly necessary for him to prove he was sent from heaven by his Father, Jehovah God. Why? For men to receive him as God’s Seed of His </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Peter declared Jesus Christ was the Prophet Moses had foretold and who was to be a prophet greater than Moses. Hence he must likewise be sent by Jehovah and be able to prove it by signs even greater than those performed by Moses. He persistently claimed to be sent by Jehovah and to have come in Jehovah’s name. To back up this claim, as Moses had done, Jesus did many more miracles than Moses did, and more marvelous. He freed his disciples from this world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 71:18, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The true Christian organization is now old with an antiquity of nineteen centuries and is, so to speak, “gray-headed”, but it does not want to quit, go on a pension and retire from declaring Jehovah’s wondrous works. The remnant of the anointed Christian organization look forward in the light of Bible prophecy and see a new generation, the next generation of servants that will take over completely after the remnant have passed off the earthly scene. They want to expand the worship of the living and true God over all the earth. Hence they want to pass on to this rising generation of people consecrated to God all the instruction he has taught them by Christ, that this next generation may be saved to eternal life on earth under God's kingdom. So they pray God not to forsake them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Belief in Jehovah God is of foremost importance and is inseparable from the gospel. On the day of Pentecost Peter called notice first and mainly to Jehovah God and declared His Word to them. After that he told them about Jesus the Nazarene. No: Peter and his fellow apostles did not ignore Jehovah. They could not, because, as Peter told them, it was Jehovah God that raised up Jesus the Seed with the bruised heel out of death and exalted him to heaven to His right hand. There he committed to Jesus the holy spirit, and on Pentecost Christ Jesus began to pour it out. See for yourselves, then, that there was here no excluding of Jehovah from the way of salvation. What was needed was more than baptism only in the name of Jesus Christ. Peter showed that the power of this way of salvation through Jesus Christ would not be possible at all without Jehovah God. So call on his name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">More than two and a half years prior to these words Paul baptized twelve believing men at Ephesus and so helped to build up the congregation at that city. At other cities Paul and Barnabas had appointed elder brothers to positions of service in the congregations, and he wrote Timothy and Titus to appoint elder brothers to positions of overseer and assistant in the congregations under their care. Now Paul was a member of the governing body of the church of that century, and he was filled with the holy spirit. If he or some other authorized persoi appointed overseers in the congregation at Ephesus, then it could truthfully be said “the holy spirit hath set you as overseers”. All appointments of men were made under the power of the spirit. The credit should be given to it, not to human instruments through whom it worked. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 1:3, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Peter tells God’s elect, or those chosen for the heavenly kingdom, that God the Father begot them again to a “living hope” by resurrecting Jesus from the dead. It is not by Jesus’ resurrection that his Kingdom joint-heirs are begotten again to the hope. God the Life-giver is the One that begets, produces, or becomes the Father of spiritual children for the Kingdom. But the resurrection of his Son was a basis for him to beget such additional spiritual sons. How so? Because by the resurrection the bruised Seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was brought back to life and could ascend to heaven and sit down at God’s right hand. Thus he could appear in God’s presence as his High Priest and could present to God the value or merit of the human sacrifice that he laid down. By it he could redeem his devoted followers. They have hope in him, not only in this life, but in the promised kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W lf/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dignities they defame.—Jude 8, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Today God has an organization of his people. In it there are special positions of responsibility. When Jehovah God honors certain ones in his visible organization with special places of service because of their faithfulness, then these responsible special servants are to be treated with due regard. It is not because of what they are in themselves in the flesh, but is because of the favor God has bestowed upon them and because we know the source of such favor and know what it means in the way of responsibility. Of course, we do not fear these, flatter them, show partiality to them or heap worldly titles and honors upon them, but we unselfishly co-operate with them and support them in the Lord’s service. Thereby we pay due respect to Jehovah God. We have respect for the dignity from God, rather than for just the person wearing it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unto each one is given the manifesting of the spirit with a view to that which is profitable.—1 Cor. 12:7, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By remembering that the holy spirit is the active force or invisible energy coming from God through Christ, we can see that the gifts of the spirit are conferred on each person with due respect to his inborn abilities or uncultivated talents. Then this spirit or invisible energy can move upon him and awaken his innate abilities to life. It can help and improve his uncultivated natural endowments and so make him more useful, more capable, more productive. God, who reads our hearts, can detect these endowments in us. No doubt, too, the Lord Jesus, when measuring out to a person the gracious gift of the spirit, takes into consideration the use to which that person is to be put or the office he is to fill. He knew what measure of gift Paul needed, and bestowed it to match. We may be sure he can do the same as to us all. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? —Rom. 6:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If we did not purpose to keep on in righteousness but intended to return to the practice of sin after a while, why should we abandon the sinful course of this world at all? But since our forsaking of sin was meant to be for all time, and since we have experienced the divine forgiveness of sins through the sacrifice of our High Priest, then we should not seek to find pleasure in practicing sin again. But sin is subtle, and we are surrounded by a world under the great promoter of sin, Satan the Devil. On this account we must always watch against taking up sin again as a practice or regular course in our lives. To that end we cannot afford to stand still and become backward, but must make progress in righteousness. Progress, not stopping, is the greatest counterforce against relapse. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">See! I have put before you an open door that no one can close. —Rev. 3:8, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Innumerable adversaries have tried to shut the door upon Jehovah’s witnesses. But our King with the key of David has miraculously kept the door open, and the ministry of this Kingdom gospel has gone forward, with more gospel ministers at the close of World War II than before. The door still stands open to the most glorious opportunity because the gospel ministry by men and women is not yet finished, but the invitation into this blessed privilege is more urgent now than ever before. Have you answered the invitation and entered through the door in brotherly love? Will you? The opportunity will close with the battle of Armageddon now drawing near, when this gospel of the Kingdom will have been preached adequately and the final end of this world will have come according to God’s due time. Then Jehovah will arise to give his own testimony by winning the fight at Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Expansion of our individual ministry is very important for our own lives now and forever. First of all, it helps us personally in rendering direct worship of God to a greater extent, and that means an enrichment of our lives. Secondly, it affords us greater opportunity to help people of good-will to gain a knowledge of the life-giving truth. That helps them to answer the grand call to this blessed gospel ministry. We should be concerned not only in expanding our own privileges in this matter, but also in helping others to get into the work God now commands his people to do for the vindication of his name. It is not the contribution of money that does this, but is chiefly the contribution of ourselves, the giving of our personal attention and aid tc those who hunger and thirst after righteousness and life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 20: 30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Such would-be leaders and divisionists act hypocritically and use words of speech that sound pleasing to the ear. Paul tells us to turn away our ears from such sly disturbers of the peace and unity of God’s flock of sheep. “I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, ... by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.” (Rom. 16:17,18, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) In like manner the Serpent beguiled Eve in Eden, and there has been no peace on earth since. Those who open their ear to his beguiling as Eve did will accept another Christ, another spirit, another gospel, than the true. (2 Cor. 11:3,4) But we did not learn the truth by listening to men that oppose God’s work; we learned it through sheep that remained in God’s flock and that seek to promote its peace and uuity. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who then is that faithful and wise steward?—Luke 12:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No individual man now on earth was here foretold, but the entire organized company of God’s consecrated people who are dedicated to his service and who work at unity as one man throughout the earth. “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” His witnesses of today must therefore serve him unitedly, as a steward over what he has entrusted to them through our Savior Jesus Christ. They must be faithful to God and be wise with heavenly wisdom in doing so. They must serve one another with the spiritual food that God has provided through his Theocratic organization. They must also serve it out to his “other sheep” who are at present strayed and lost from the paths of truth and righteousness and whom the Good Shepherd must yet find and gather to his Theocratic fold. Jehovah’s witnesses have a world-wide assignment, to preach the Kingdom gospel. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lawf It was a later addition, designed to produce transgressions, until the descendant to which the promise was made should come.—Gal. 3:19, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The law produced transgressions by showing what these were and who the transgressors were and by making them realize-they were transgressors. “The law entered, that the offense might abound.” (Rom. 5:20) The humble, honest-hearted Israelites saw that their fallen condition did not permit them to keep that law, and that they needed to repent for their sins and to look to God for deliverance from their sinfulness and its bad effects. Such deliverance must come by the promised Seed of Abraham in whom all the nations of the earth are to be blessed. To produce this realization of sin and their need to repent of it and their need of a Savior was really God’s purpose in giving the Israelites his law through Moses. It was to show up their transgressions and to point them to the coming Descendant of Abraham. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.—2 Pet. 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Under test Jesus proved that a man in the flesh can be tried to the very limit, a most shameful and painful death, and yet hold on to perfect godliness. Satan has made himself the “god of this world” and wants everybody in it to become worldly according to the style of this world. He tries to get all to worship him as god by becoming a part of this world, thereby giving their allegiance to his domination. Conforming oneself to Satan’s wishes is worldliness, and it denies the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God. Worldliness and godliness are exact opposites. By cleaving to godliness in the midst of the Devil’s world Jesus Christ vindicated the universal sovereignty of God his Father. He refused to bow down and worship Satan the Devil and to become a part of his wicked world. He did not go worldly. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And 1 saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great ehain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon.-—Rev. 20:1, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This angel who is mightier than Satan and who binds and imprisons him is no other than Christ Jesus himself, for the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">angel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">messenger.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s “angel of the testament”, or “angel of the covenant”, who is sent to vindicate Jehovah’s sovereignty and name. (Mal. 3:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bagster’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">LXX</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> trans.) The “great chain” with which he binds Satan is not the power of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel never has bound and never will bind that wicked counterfeiter of the gospel. The “chain” pictures Christ’s extensive, unbreakable power to restrain Satan completely. So great is his power that he does not first have to kill Satan in order to render him powerless. No, he catches him alive and enchains him and then he crushes his head to death.—Gen. 3:15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be a good minister of Jesus Christ.—1 Tim.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4-' </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As in Timothy’s case, youth is no barrier to one’s becoming a minister. One who does become such will daily preach the good news. It has always been recognized that ministers would take a neutral position on world affairs and that they would be indifferent to the controversies of the world, because they are not of this world nor a part of it, although they are in it. Christ Jesus was not of this world. He was in it, but this was for the sole purpose of preaching the gospel and vindicating his Father’s name. In a prayer to his Father in heaven he requested that the same spirit that was poured upon him be poured upon all his followers that they might preach the good news in the world. This makes it plain that age is not the determining factor with God’s ministers, neither is sex. The thing that qualifies one as a minister is his knowledge of the Lord’s Word and his zeal and devotion to God, and, most important, God’s spirit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.—1 Cor. 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This coming refers not to his coming into the Kingdom A.D. 1914, nor to his coming to the spiritual temple of God in 1918 for judgment work. It refers to his coming to the completion of his church-bride in the heavenly kingdom, the full consummation of the marriage of the Lamb of God and his spiritual bride, the church. In view of this, the Memorial supper will one day cease to be kept upon this earth. That will be when the remnant of Christ’s body, who bear about in themselves the dying of the Lord Jesus, will have proved their faithfulness to death, thereby finishing their earthly course. Hence the Memorial will not be celebrated during Christ’s millennial reign after this remnant has been joined with him in the kingdom above. The Memorial is observed till his coming, to show forth the one thing, “his death,” in which it is given to his anointed body-members to share as a gracious privilege from God—11:24, A.S.V. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To become heirs of an incorruptible inheritance reserved in heaven with Jesus Christ the King, the 144,000 must be begotten again by God the Father. Why? Because they, to begin with, had been begotten by Adam, and he could not beget anyone to spiritual, heavenly inheritance. By natural procreation his children cannot rise higher in the scale of life than he their father. So for 144,000 of his condemned offspring to become inheritors of the heavenly kingdom with Christ, they must not only be redeemed but also be begotten by a father different from Adam, a heavenly father who can bestow spirit life and a spiritual inheritance in heaven. To this end Jehovah God, the Father of Jesus Christ, has begotten them again, thus adopting them as his heirs.—Gal. 4: 4-7. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By co-operating with Christ Jesus his disciples, women and men alike, were ministers of Christ. But through him they were at the same time ministers to God, because Christ Jesus was God’s anointed Representative. While Joshua, Elisha and the Levites were spoken of as being ministers to Moses, Elijah and the high priest, they rendered their service as to Jehovah and were primarily God’s ministers and serving according to his appointment. In like manner those who joined with Christ Jesus in his work were spoken of as his ministers. Today we, too, can be God’s ministers and Christ’s, because Christ Jesus is God’s Chief Official. We can serve God through Christ, who makes our works acceptable to God. We serve God by working under Christ Jesus, whom God has appointed as Head over all His servants. In fact, none can render acceptable service to God except through Christ our Leader. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.-—Jude 3, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The faith is based upon the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, to which Jesus constantly referred to support what he taught, and also upon the teachings which he gave as the Son of God sent down from heaven. It was delivered nineteen centuries ago to the saints “once for all”. For that reason there is no other gospel. There will never be another given. What has been delivered to us remains the faith, because it is sufficient to accomplish God’s purpose. The Devil would like to turn the heirs of salvation aside from the true faith of the gospel by counterfeiting the true and foisting a false gospel upon God’s people. In all earnestness, then, we have to struggle, wrestle and contend against the shams and diversions with which the Devil tries to win us away. It is a “precious faith”, well worth contending for, because it leads to everlasting salvation.—2 Pet. 1:1. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Impious creatures who pervert the grace of our God into immorality and disown . . . Christ.-—Jude 4, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God was gracious and merciful to us in washing us from our sins in Christ’s blood, not for us to yield to the cravings of our fallen flesh and go back to former filth and uncleanness now and again, but for us to pursue determinedly the way of righteousness henceforth. A faithful person that appreciates this purpose of God’s grace and mercy will not pervert it presumptuously. He will contend for the faith once delivered to the saints by indignantly resisting the advances and suggestions of impious persons who creep in among us unawares. We know we are slaves of Christ bought with blood for God’s service. If we yielded unsteadily to ungodly persons and took up the service of sin for the selfish pleasure of our flesh, it would be denying, yes, disowning Jesus Christ as Master and Lord. True to the faith, we refuse to do this. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus knew the congregation of his brethren needed gifts in the way of men with special powers and capacities. But to produce such men as gifts for the congregation he had to pour out the spirit upon them. The gift of the holy spirit makes us able in many fields of service. It is an expression of God’s grace or undeserved goodness to us through Christ. The special abilities and aptitudes that his spirit awakens within us are a grace from God. God can do with his own property what he wills. So he does not confer upon all Christians the very same abilities and qualifications. Each one has his own gracious gift to the extent that Christ Jesus measures it out to each individual in the church. He does not at once take these followers to heaven to have them with him. No; but all these new creatures with new powers he confers upon his congregation on earth for its benefit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We should do nothing to hinder or resist the gathering work which the King Jesus Christ is doing by means of his angels. In Jesus’ day Jerusalem resisted the gathering together of her children by him, and for this she was destroyed and her people were scattered to the ends of the earth. (Matt. 23 : 37, 38) The same fate, or worse, will befall Christendom. We act wisely, therefore, if we aid in Christ's gathering work and help in the unifying work. To do this, we must lovingly consider the “sheep” whom Christ has gathered together. We must meet with them and encourage them to love God by doing his good works. We must help them to confess openly without wavering their faith and hope by ourselves going out with them in giving witness to God’s kingdom. All together as one, we must march to the goal of perfection. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In defiance the rulers of Christendom set up the League of Nations, beginning with 1920, and it has been revived and renovated since 1945 under the form of the United Nations. These rulers of this world have set it up as their standard. They choose and worship it instead of Jehovah’s enthroned King. They glorify their symbol of world domination, their Caesar, instead of Jehovah’s Signal of universal sovereignty, Jesus Christ. Therefore their standard, to which they strive to rally all peoples and nations with their backs to earth’s rightful Ruler Christ Jesus, is an abomination to God. It will bring on all who worship this anti-Christ standard of rulership desolation from the hand of Jehovah God. It stands in the “holy place”, because it commands the reverence and worship of the peoples, which signifies a denial of Jehovah’s royal Signal, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The head of Christ is God.—1 Cor. 11: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To correspond with the fact that God is his Superior and Head, Jesus declared he came, not to do his own will, but that of his Father, and not to speak his own words or doctrines, but those of his Father, In harmony with the prophecies of old Jesus declared himself to be a servant to God, and not a person co-equal with God. Isaiah 42:1 gives a prophetic utterance of Jehovah God respecting Jesus Christ as his servant, saying: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth.” This prophecy Matthew 12: 17-21 applies to Jesus. That this servanthood of Jesus toward God means his lower station and subordination to Jehovah God is made certain by Jesus’ own announced rule: “The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.” (Matt. 10:24) It is because of the servant’s inferiority to his lord that he must suffer with his lord, as Jesus did. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hear, and your soul shall live.—Isa. 55:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing, that is, not just hearing literally, but what hearing symbolizes for even a literally deaf man, means our salvation to life. This, of course, means far more than just hearing the sound of the message. It means entertaining the message, accepting it, believing it, and obediently acting upon it. Those who thus hear will not have their souls blotted out by Jehovah God, who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. (Matt. 10:28, A.S.V., margin) Their souls will be sustained forever in the new world. It follows, then, that all of mankind who will gain eternal salvation must hear the good news of God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus the Ransomer, and they must be given the opportunity to aet in harmony with it. Their obedient hearing with faith or belief must, in all cases, precede salvation. As it is written: “How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By what means he is made whole; . . . by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.—Acts 4:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is power of salvation in Jesus’ name. In .proof, the man whom Peter cured was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">made whole</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> through faith in his name. Jesus’ name could effect not only a physical cure of one’s body but, better still, one’s eternal salvation. The expression Peter used, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">made whole,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> referring to the physical cure, is the same word in the original Bible text as he used when he said: “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">be saved.&quot;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (4:12) This use of words is also true with respeet to Jesus’ cures. (Matt. 9:21,22; Luke 8:48,50; 17:19) Through faith in him as Jehovah’s promised Seed persons were relieved or saved from their affliction. This performing of bodily cures through faith in Jesus illustrated how you may be saved to an eternal salvation through faith in his name as the name of Jehovah’s Seed or Son. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hereby know ye the spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God.—1 John 4-' 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In apostolic times, nineteen hundred years ago, it was of antichristian spirit or inspiration for anyone to deny that Jesus had come to earth as a man and suffered and died and been raised from the dead. So now, in this twentieth century, it is equally of unchristian inspiration for men of this world to say Jesus Christ does not need to come as King to rule the earth. Even if such men are of Christendom it does not mean such utterances are Christian and are inspired by the spirit of God and cannot be of demon-inspiration. By what test do we know for certain that they are of antichrist and are not inspired by God’s spirit? By testing such utterances with what is taught in the Bible. And why with the Bible? Because the Bible was produced by means of the spirit of God. Anything against Bible teaching is against His spirit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He . . . cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished.—Rev. 20:2,3, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This proves that the 1000-year reign of Christ begins, not at the close of the Gentile times A.D. 1914, but after Armageddon is fought and all his foes are destroyed and are thus unable to interfere with his righteous rule of peace. The imprisoning of Satan the Devil in the abyss means the completion of the destruction of the &quot;heavens and the earth, which are now”, and which are “kent in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men”. (2 Pet. 3:7; Rev. 20:11) That earth has been the visible organization of the Devil over men, whereas the heaven has been the invisible organization of him and his demons. By the end of this “day of Jehovah” they will have been destroyed as if by fire. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exercise thyself rather unto godliness.—1 Tim. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul’s wisdom is better than that of this world in urging us to train in godliness. This, too, is strenuous. It calls for activity just the same as bodily exercise does, but the benefits are greater and more lasting. If we do not want to give up our devotion to God under pressure of persecution it certainly calls for training to make us strong in godliness as Jesus was. He showed godliness in a very active way, acting as God’s minister, prophet and witness. He got right out among the people, visiting their homes, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to them, healing their sicknesses, protecting them against religious frauds, and building up a missionary school of gospel-preachers. There was nothing lazy or weak about this godliness. Regardless of the bitterest persecution from the religious leaders, he held fast to his devotion and service to God. He trained in godliness by displaying faithful endurance and loving obedience. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He is maliciously accusing me. Not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers.—3 John 10, A..A..T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sometimes persons imagine to themselves such an important position in life that they feel they can be the judges and find fault with others. Then they cause disturbance in the Christian company, until no one is contented. They really do not gain a thing by it, because godliness brings gain to us if it is accompanied by contentment. But there is great gain in coming to a knowledge of the truth and becoming God’s servant and pursuing godliness. Yes, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> we are contented. We cannot afford to be faultfinders, accusers. If we become such, there will be no contentment. Godliness must stay linked with contentment if we are to find some satisfaction in being a witness of Jehovah and in being associated with his Theocratic organization. Our service to God must be connected with peace among ourselves. Otherwise, there will be no happiness so far as we are concerned. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus has made his remnant today a steward in charge of all. (Luke 12 : 42-44) They are necessarily different from the religionists of Christendom, because they have something committed to them that her religious systems do not have. Her religionists falsely accuse Jehovah’s witnesses as being deceitful prophets and not true to their name, but because of such religious accusations Jehovah God has not cast them out of his service, nor withheld from them his Bible truths, nor held back his blessing trom their witness work, nor yielded them up to their enemies to be utterly suppressed and destroyed. The apostle Paul went right ahead under accusations. We can do the same letting our activities and works in obedience to God testify to our faithful stewardship and explode all false enemy charges. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses are looked at by earthly governments as an obstinate people, a people that just will not fall in line and that will not accept a man-made thing as their savior. The world, through its judges and its rulers, demands that these witnesses render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and more, too; for they forget the rest of the command: ‘Render to God the things that aie God’s.’ These witnesses, no matter under what nationality or form of government they happen to be born, always comply with the rules and regulations of that nation. They pay their taxes; they speak the language of the nation; they accept the education of the nation through its schools. They support all the laws of the land that are in full accord with God’s principles of truth and righteousness. They follow most of the customs and habits of the people. But one thing they cannot do, and that is, violate their conscience trained in God’s Word. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The 144,000 Christian believers consecrate themselves to God and undertake to follow Jesus’ steps till death. Their being begotten again by God is what makes them his spiritual children and his heirs with a heavenly hope. As Jesus their Redeemer entered into the heavenly inheritance by laying aside his earthly human existence and by being resurrected from death, so too with the 144,000. They must enter their inheritance above by laying down human life and by being resurrected from death to life in heaven at the time that God’s kingdom is established with the Seed of his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the throne. Then these spiritual children of God will be revealed in heavenly power with Jesus.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In God’s Word Jesus read all the things in store for him. Yet he left the money-paying job of carpentering and took up the preaching ministry of God. Why? To give the most complete answer to Satan’s charge against God’s true ministers and witnesses and so vindicate Jehovah God as the only Master worthy of serving. He would also lay down his human life as a ransom for all on earth who would become God’s ministers and remain such for ever in the righteous new world. God did not let Jesus walk blindly into the ministry during this present evil world, without knowing what it was to cost. All the tenor of the Bible is to inform us what it now costs to be a real witness and servant of God, now while Satan’s challenge to God's ministers must still he met. This frank information keeps us from being surprised. It forearms us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10115</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The willful sinner loses the desire to take on more knowledge of God’s purpose. He does not care to take on further responsibility for added knowledge, or to continue shouldering responsibility for what he already knows and enjoys. He quits putting forth faith in God and loving him and the truth and righteousness for which God stands. He draws hack. In the start his drawing back might be ever so small, seemingly a mere stopping, but it acquires motion and gathers speed and momentum with his persistence in this course. It finally becomes unstoppable, and he plunges into the hopeless state under the doom of destruction. Mindful of this, how firmly ought we to determine not to make the stop with which the drawing back begins, especially now that the day of the Lord God is upon us and his Messenger of the covenant, Christ Jesus, is at the temple to execute judgment! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Take advantage of the shortening of the days of tribulation by God. Redeem this time of divine grace, by applying it in the way he wants, fulfilling the commission he has laid upon us as his witnesses, his ambassadors, sent forth to mark all foreheads of good-will. Bend all your energies, devote all your resources, to the great educational work upon the people who sigh and cry, to comfort them with the knowledge of God and his Kingdom purposes. We know this educational work and this training of people of all nationalities to worship God requires time and patience. Be thankful for the time allowed, and, by His grace, do not fail in patience with bis own marvelous example of patience before your eyes. While organized religion of Satan’s world makes its own enormous gains, why fret? Keep on steadily preaching as God commands. Expand his true worship, due to the increase he gives. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While Jesus served in a public way dealing exclusively with God’s Word, he had others who ministered to him in various ways in order that his ministry might not be disturbed or lessened. Not to be left unmentioned are the several women, who went along with him and his apostles on some of their travels and rendered various services that female hands could offer. The apostles, too, at times went out and did the shopping to provide things for the meals, or to arrange for meetings. (John 4:8; Luke 9:52; 22:8,13) However, they also ministered to Christ Jesus by joining in with him in preaching the glad tidings of God’s kingdom, in some cases breaking the ground for his coming later to top off a local witness to the Kingdom. He thus trained them to serve God in a public way, for the public benefit. In thus co-operating with him these disciples, men and women alike, were ministers of Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 16: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By holding true to his mission and pouring out his soul to the bitter death, Jesus saved his life, by proving worthy of Jehovah’s reward for faithfulness. He refused to save himself, preferring to let God save him for his unbroken integrity to Him. Therefore, in this Jesus was an example to his followers. Having taken all the preliminary steps of repentance, conversion, consecration, and baptism, thereby denying ourselves, we must take up our stake of suffering reproach and pain for righteousness’ sake and must follow him. That is, we must keep on following him to the finish, enduring as he did and not seeking to save our lives, or present earthly souls. If we try to save our lives, we are not denying ourselves, and we shall lose our future lives, or souls, in the new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W %/l</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Internal peculiarities of Genesis and the findings of archaeology go to show Moses got his materials for writing Genesis from written documents and not by oral tradition. Even getting his information in writing was in a sense getting it by tradition, for the broad meaning of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tradition</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">delivery; act of delivering into the hands of another.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Since tradition can be by mouth-to-mouth transmission or by writing, Paul wrote as above. Compiling the record from original sources in writing safeguarded against memory lapses by imperfect men and insured the accurate, uncorrupted transmitting of the vital facts to future generations of God’s people. His spirit exercised itself that there might be a faithful transmitting and compiling of the Holy Scriptures for his servants, for them to be sure of the firm basis of their faith. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The itch on their part is to hear teachers that tickle their selfish desires and that teach in harmony with the learning, political schemes and popular things of this world that do not call for true repentance and a change in one’s life according to the Bible. The truth is too much for their ears to endure, for it is unpopular, and they do not wish to be made free from their pleasurable, sinful habits in this world. Hence, there is now a heap of teachers of fables, who fill Christendom and heathendom with their doctrines contrary to God’s Word of truth. To counteract this, God urged his servant to preach the truth continually, saying: “Preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.”—4: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2, A.S.V.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Unstable ones are in danger of the fire or everlasting destruction reserved for the “goats” of this time. By our coming quickly to their aid with exhortation, instruction and prayer, we are in effect snatching them out of the fire. Some may have yielded to deceivers and fallen to immorality with them or fornication with this world, spiritually speaking. As it were, the inner garment next to their flesh they have stained through giving way to animal practices. They have stained their identity as true Christians. We hate such a garment and fear to spot up our own garment of Christian identity in sueh a way, for it displeases God and may lead to destruction. While we hate the stained garment, we have mercy upon its wearer.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some gifts, such as prophesying, supervising, ministering, managing, organizing, must be cultivated or worked at with a purpose. Then they will be mastered or the person become proficient in them. It does us no good to desire and long for these greater gifts earnestly and lazily do nothing for the sake of realizing our longing desire. “The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.” Otherwise said: “The lazy man has longings, but gets nothing: the diligent man is amply supplied.” (Prov. 13:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Merely praying for the desired gift does not show our full degree of faith. Diligent efforts and works toward attaining the gift give full life to our faith and lead to gaining what we desire.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This casting of Satan and his wicked angels down does not mean binding him for a thousand years or the bruising of his head, relieving the nations of the oppressions of Satan and his seductions. The casting of him down to the earth leads up to greater woe for the earth and sea, and also to his persecutions and war against the remnant of the seed of God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> because these keep God’s commands and deliver the witness that Jesus Christ is King. No, Satan is not yet bound and in the abyss. All the religious teaching that Christendom’s clergy have given the people for the past sixteen centuries since Constantine’s day have failed to bind and put restraint upon Satan and his demons. Rather, as the light of God’s Word shines now upon the facts of history, we see that by such religious teaching Satan the Devil has deceived and seduced the whole world.—Rev. 12: 9. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Jude here shows those who share in the hope of “our common salvation” is that this salvation is not yet a closed matter, all sealed up and delivered to us beyond loss and failure. Despite our being now in the saved condition, we of the remnant can fail of “our common salvation”. How? By not contending for the faith. Just succumb to the enticements of the ungodly persons who pervert God’s grace into an excuse for immorality and worldliness and whose course disowns our Master and Lord Jesus Christ. Such impious ones had their doom foretold long ago, by the historical record of the Bible. Let them read their doom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide have one aim in life, and that is to magnify the name of Jehovah and to share with Christ in vindicating His name and Word. They realize he has gathered together the persons of good-will who love him into one organization, and that is, a Theocratic organization. Theocratic, yes, but not nationalistic are these witnesses of Jehovah. Ii governments of men set up boundaries and adopt certain languages for certain territories, and because some of God’s consecrated people live in those particular lands, that is no reason for believing they are separate and distinct from all the other witnesses of God throughout the earth. They are not. They are one body in the Lord, one organization, with one God Jehovah and one Lord Jesus Christ and one law. That is the law God has given them, namely, to minister to him and to preach the gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the Pharisees refused to believe Jesus for the works such as no other man had ever done, and when they said the power doing such unusual good works was from Beelzebub the prince of the demons, then they were sinning. Sin and blasphemy against the holy spirit are sinful and abusive, injurious speech against the open demonstration of God’s power. The religious leaders guilty of such were willfully sinning for selfish reasons, because they were sinning against manifest facts, which they saw and knew. They voluntarily did not want to accept the testimony of the spirit of God at work in the servant of God. They resisted the display of the spirit of God. This willful quality in their sin was what made it unforgivable, because it made them unteachable, beyond correction, opposed to God’s provision for forgiveness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When professed Christians get to thinking that their adoption of godliness provides ways and means for selfish worldly gain, their minds have gone bad and become corrupted. Such persons become lost to the truth. Sometimes people will associate with the truth thinking they are going to get some personal material gain from the individuals in God’s organization. If they use godliness as a means of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">selfish</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> gain, then their motive and mental attitude will injure them spaitually. They will become bereft of the truth, lost! While it betrays a corrupt mind to view godliness as a way and means of personal material gain, yet Paul does say it is “a great means of gain”. (6: 6, A.A.T.) That is, provided one combines godliness “with a sufficiency of one’s own”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Feeling a sufficiency of one’s own means contentment.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnesses of the Most High God are a wonder for their firm refusal to compromise with this world. They are a marvel for openly confessing Jehovah’s name and preaching his kingdom in the same way Christ and his disciples did, “publicly, and from house to house.” Christ’s faithful imitators today are marvelous like him for the persecutions and hostility they endure from combined Christendom and Jewry and for the afflictions and false accusations and shame they have endured till now, so that Christendom is astounded because they still keep on going and increasing. They know they must be exposed as a wonder, a prodigy, a portent, before the world’s eyes and what this position must cost them. In order to endure it they make the Most High God their strong refuge, and thus they keep their integrity unbroken toward him.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The rich young ruler, who claimed to be an honest man, saying he kept God’s commandments from his youth up, was not wise and foresighted enough to follow Jesus’ advice. He was unwilling to use his mammon or wealth to make friends with Jesus and Jehovah God by using it in the way that Jesus advised so as to have “treasure in heaven”. Hence, “he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.” This proved Jesus’ saying, “That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 19: 16-24) The young man’s mammon or wealth became specially unrighteous to him, because he made it his god, and was unwilling to drop his love of it that he might love God with everything that he had. However, the repentant tax-gatherer Zacchaeus showed proper prudence and made the right friends by the course he followed with his mammon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

By none of these law codes is man taught his fallen condition in God’s sight and his need of turning to Him in repentance for salvation by his Seed of promise. But by the law of Moses the Israelites or Jews themselves as well as the Gentile nations were shown to be transgressors against Jehovah God. His Word says all the world, Jews and Gentiles, are guilty before Him. None is able to make himself righteous before God. Only one man was ever born sinless of a woman.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Father’s superior greatness over all others included being greater than his Son, and Jesus said so in these unmistakable words to his disciples: “If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.” (14: 28) When Jesus thus said his Father was greater than the Son, he was not referring to his flesh. He was referring to himself as an individual, even before he came to this earth and was made man. Did not Jesus repeatedly say God the Father sent him and that the Sender is greater than he that is sent? Yes; and when God sent the Son, the Son was still in heaven and not yet a man of flesh and blood. God sent him, not from Bethlehem or from Nazareth as a man, but down from heaven as his Son. In thus sending Jesus from heaven, God showed he is greater than the Son whom he sent. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

The signal (or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nehs)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was not carried about by some person, but was fixed and stationary; set up, not in the middle of a highway, but upon a lofty height.

To this day, since the birth of the first human child, mankind has by its own efforts been unable to escape “vanity”, that is, human frailty, corruption, and leanings to perverseness, foolishness and empty unprofitableness. By letting human creatures be born under such conditions Jehovah was subjecting all human creation to such “vanity” without our willing it. But why? Was not this an injustice to us all, tantalizing us with a brief taste of existence under such vain conditions? Not at all! It was an unspeakable mercy to us all. God did not instantly destroy Adam and Eve childless, but mercifully let the human creation be born subject to all this “vanity” because of the precious hope of deliverance that he set before all human creatures. We are filled with joy and peace in believing and taking hope. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.—Matt. 7:</span><span class="font6"> 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A person with the hearing ear will not turn away his ear after he hears from God what he must do, and then forsake God’s service and go the way of this world because it is more pleasing to the depraved flesh. He keeps his ear inclined toward God that he may receive more instruction, and may know better how to please the Lord God. He not only addresses Jehovah God as his Lord or Master, but also obediently acts as Jehovah’s slave, and refuses to run away from His service to seek his own liberty. He is like that servant described in Moses’ law. Such servant loved his master to the extent that he refused to go free when the seventh year of legal release came around. (Deut. 15: 12-17) Like that servant he lets his ear be bored to indicate he <sup>,-</sup>s Jehovah’s willing servant for evermore. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The holy spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.—Heb. 3: 7, 8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who wrote Psalm 95, from which the above is quoted, we do not know. Hence we cannot say that in Psalm 95 the spirit spake </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> so-and-so. The main point is that the psalmist was inspired to speak by God’s spirit, and so Paul explains it by saying “the holy spirit saith”. The real speaker talking about entering into rest is Jehovah God, but he used his holy spirit to express himself through the anonymous writer of Psalm 95. Likewise Jeremiah and Moses spoke and acted under the power of the holy spirit, and so Paul gives the credit for their prophecies to the spirit, and not to the men. (Heb. 10: 15-17 and 9:8) The spirit proceeded forth from Jehovah God. It was beamed down upon Moses and Jeremiah. This made it, in reality, Jehovah God that was prophesying. Under no circumstances do Paul’s words about the spirit uphold a “trinity”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These . . . speak evil of dignities. Woe unto them/ for they have gone in the way of Cain.—Jude 8,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God dignified Abel with the acceptance of his sacrifice. He instructed Cain to procure a like sacrifice as a sin-offering. Cain grew envious. He did not respect the dignity bestowed upon Abel and follow his example and seek honor from God. He hated the dignity upon his brother and thought injuriously of him. Then he murdered him, “because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.” (1 John 3:12) These animalistic religionists are like Cain in hating the faithful witnesses whom Jehovah has dignified with his service and in speaking abusively about them. They are murderers because of having Cain’s attitude: “whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.” (1 John 3: 15) Cain was cursed; there is no eternal life for him, and his offspring were wiped out by the Flood. Hence, woe to those today who have gone in the way of Cain! Do not follow them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But having food and covering we shall be therewith content. —1 Tim. 6:8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Certainly with food, clothing and shelter we should be content. That is all we are promised as God’s servants. We brought nothing into the world when we were born. Why, then, make a fuss about what someone else has? If we can help other people out with food and clothing, that is an aid to them in God’s service. But we should not feel that anybody is obligated to us to feed and clothe us in our need. If they want to help us, that is a good thing if it is with benefit to the Lord’s service. The point is, As long as we have food and covering we should be content, because, besides such things, we have something far more precious than food and clothing. That is the message of God’s kingdom. The great thing foi us in the Lord’s organization is to have a knowledge of his Word and to minister it to others and be content. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/16</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What time have Jehovah’s witnesses for dabbling in political campaigns and battles, or in trying to influence secular governments as to what course of action to take in the present-day struggle for world domination? Their commission to preach takes the best of their time, and their devotion to the principles of truth and integrity and uncorruptedness grips them all their time. They fully know and are persuaded that the only way for peace and perfect happiness to be brought to the human family is by man’s accepting Jehovah God as the Supreme One of the universe and also accepting his Son, his chief witness, as the Ransomer of man and as the rightful King of the new world. Jehovah has made the provisions for man to get life through his Son. Jehovah is the real Life-giver, and all men that hope to have life in the “world without end” will have to abide by his provisions and accept him as God and his Son as the Redeemer and King. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan the Devil has all this world under his control. But to satisfy himself he desperately seeks to bring about the destruction of those who have repentantly forsaken this world and devoted themselves to God through faith in his promised Seed. Knowing Satan’s wiliness and wicked designs, Jehovah in His written Word gives repeated warnings to those who have started in salvation’s way. By religious and political agents Satan tries to destroy our faith in Jehovah God’s way of salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord and King. Through his servant Jude, God warns us that it is possible for those who have experienced the opening features of salvation to he overreached by Satan’s religious, political agents and to desert God and Christ, and that the penalty for such desertion will be destruction at God’s hands.—Jude 5. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W If/I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?—1 Cor. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By no means can God’s true ministers of his gospel undertake to act as the custodians of the morals of the state or of the public community. We cannot by making laws give people an injection of righteousness and morality. Why, the true ministers of God’s Word cannot even force the gospel of salvation upon anyone; and it is only through that gospel that any person attains to real righteousness and morality in God’s sight. How, then, can Christendom’s ministers of religion hope to regulate the morality' of the political state and to legislate uprightness into the people that do not accept and obey the gospel of Got in Christ. They cannot. Jehovah’s witnesses are well instructed in that gospel. They do not let themselves be fooled into joining the religious clergy in that futile effort which does not have God’s approval or backing. Only his kingdom will bring in a new, moral world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death.—1 John 5:16, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle John defines sin, saying, “All unrighteousness is sin,” and yet he adds, “There is a sin not unto death.” (5:17) Sin is sin, but there are different qualities or aspects about sin. For instance, Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death,” and how, then, can there be a “sin not unto death” ? In this way: If the sinner does not sin willfully, but repents of his sin and turns to God for the benefit of Christ’s atoning sacrifice, his sin can be forgiven. He can be spared, redeemed, delivered from the death which the sin would otherwise bring upon him as the penalty. Despite this, we should not take sin lightly, because really there is a “sin unto death”, and the prayers of others for persons that commit this sin will do no good for them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Contrary to the popular form of worldliness, Paul gave no instructions to Timothy as overseer to build gymnasiums alongside of Christian meeting-places and to establish organizations with training and exercises to keep the physical bodies of the mature and aging Christians in good health. Paul was not shortsighted spiritually. He did not narrow his view down to our brief life in this unhealthy world. He looked to the eternal future also, as of more importance. He admitted honestly that hodily exercises were of some physical value, but just a little, for a little while at most. But such physical training does not throw off the condemnation of death. It does not stop the dying processes in the men exercising and training. Such training is only of some small service to men. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee.—2 Tim. 1: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> today must not expect the spirit of God to do it all, while we lazily neglect talents and abilities and limply show no initiative and make no plans. The thing to do is to lend ourselves energetically to the work, purposefully exerting our abilities to the full for the work’s sake. Let us stir up our gifts, such as we have. If we have been appointed to a job or if an invitation to share in a work has been accorded us, then let us give it our best, whether that requires advance study, training, practice, rehearsing, or other preparation. Enter into the work with faith, with love for it, with self-discipline. Make the effort to please God in the gift of service. Then his spirit may confidently be expected to work invisibly with us and make up for what we lack, or improve what we have. It will work with our powers already possessed, but we must put forth the effort first, must bestir ourselves mentally and physically and get alive to the work. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As in Jesus’ case, God pays no money salary now to any one to be his minister. True, he promises faithfully to provide for them, and he does so; and they have the right to pray him, “Give us this day our daily bread.” But nowhere in all his Word does he promise his true servants wealth and worldly honors and positions. The challenging accusation of Satan forbids that. True, also, a person while actively serving as God’s minister may have an earthly occupation bringing in some material returns. But that is merely a side-line, an honorable avocation, for him. His main obligation, his true calling and vocation, is that of being a minister to teach and preach the truths and principles of Christianity both privately and publicly, and to do so regularly. This he must attend to if he has consecrated to God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—John H:2, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After his resurrection from the dead Jesus went to heaven, and his promise of a heavenly dwelling-place belongs, not to mankind in general, but strictly to the “little flock” of his genuine, faithful followers. They were the little ones to whom he said: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32) To gain entrance into the abode of the heavenly kingdom, Jesus’ faithful disciples must undergo a change at the time of their resurrection out of death, a change from human personality to spiritual personality, such as Jesus underwent at the moment of his resurrection. Their being clothed upon then with incorruption and immortality makes it sure that these victorious Christians will be able to occupy their new home in heaven for all time without change.—1 Pet. 3:18; 1 Cor. 15: 47-53. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because the life of the Lamb of God was poured out in death for the good of all mankind, the foundation of a righteous new world was laid in him. Today there is a multitude of persons who are sheeplike and who do good to the faithful remnant of Christ’s brethren; and when the great tribulation is over, he in his Kingdom glory will say the above words to this earthly class of sheep. The Kingdom’s blessings were prepared for them from the world’s foundation because the Lamb of God died not only for “his body, which is the church”, but also for all others of mankind that should believe on his sacrifice as a sin-offering and devote themselves to God through him. In harmony with this John wrote to the church, the body of Christ: “He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The foolish persons will refuse to hear; and as to what further to do about them the proverb says: “Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.” (Prov. 23:9) So, when a person shows himself to be a fool or goat and willfully forbears to hear, we waste no time with him but pass on to find the sheep with hearing ears. Eventually those forbearing to hear must and will be made to know and realize that a prophet, Jehovah’s company of preachers with the true message of salvation, has been among them, so that they are without excuse and Jehovah God is vindicated as blameless and free from neglect. By lovingly obeying the divine command to go on out and preach we cause many hitherto deaf ears to hear. But really Jehovah is the opener of their deaf ears, for he sends us and equips us with his message. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The times of the Gentiles have indeed run out, but we as Christians and witnesses of Jehovah will take no subversive action to overthrow any of these nations. Such action would never hasten the coming of the great day of God Almighty. So we humble ourselves under his mighty hand, and yield all to him as the great Potter who makes and who breaks. We are grateful he has not broken us but has spared us since 1918 and has committed to us the precious treasure of his ministry in our earthern vessels. (2 Cor. 4:7) If Almighty God continues to let the nations remain and rage against him, we are content. We find no fault. In fact, we are thankful for it. We know it has meant our own salvation and will mean further the salvation of countless others. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has prepared a great joy for heaven and earth. It is like the joy that overflows at the marriage of a dear son to his bride. No creature can know Jehovah’s depth of joy when he unites his chief Son, his first born, with the beloved bride he provides for this Son. Yet all in heaven and earth who are friends of God and of the marriage principals will rejoice at the delightsome event in heaven. Remember that Jehovah’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is not a woman of flesh and blood, but is his holy organization of devoted servants throughout the universe, over all of whom he is the Head. Likewise, the wife that he creates for his beloved Son is an organization, a “new creation”, composed of the faithful number of Jesus’ footstep followers. The consummation of their marriage is in the time of the kingdom of Jehovah God Almighty. That time, marked by this joyous event, is here!

The “last Adam”, Christ the Lord, also has his “day” of a thousand years, in which he reigns, but he becomes “the Everlasting Father” to all that obey him as King. “He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,” the death that the “first Adam” brought upon mankind. Under Satan and his demons the 2,520 years of Gentile domination of the earth have brought mankind to their present woeful state, and have been a curse. But not so Christ's continuous reign of a thousand years. He and his 144,000 will make up the “new heavens” which God promised to establish to displace the Satanic heavens and to pour down righteousness upon obedient mankind. “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth.”—2 Pet. 3:13. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To what have these Christian slaves been called? To a position higher and freer than that of the freest citizen of this world, freer than the greatest slaveholder or employer of the greatest number of industrial workers. So they have something of which to conduct themselves worthy: “that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.” (1 Thess. 2:12) Slaves now of Jesus Christ, but also called by God to the glorious kingdom of his Son in heaven 1 This ordering of matters illustrates the wise rule of humility before glory. As Jesus said: “Whoever wants to hold the first place among you must be your slave.” (Matt. 20:27, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What a wonderful salvation is in store for these Christian slaves if they walk worthy of it to the end by loyally serving their Master to the death, despite having to bear all the reproaches that came upon him also! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus came into the world to save sinners.—1 Tim. 1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When on earth Jesus did not shun sinners. No, he companied with them so as to do them good. Had he wanted to avoid association with sinners, he would not have come to earth in the first place to be made in the likeness of men who were then of sinful flesh. He would have remained in heaven with God his holy Father. How, then, would God’s purpose respecting the Seed of Abraham for blessing all nations have been fulfilled? So, like a great physician he came and visited the human family in their sick condition so as to provide the remedy and heal them. Being touched by fallen men did not soil him, as religious Pharisees thought it would do in their own cases. In just the opposite way, when the diseased and afflicted touched him with faith in his power, virtue went out from him and healed them. Therefore today, with confident faith, men may approach him for relief from sin. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On the day of Pentecost “the spirit gave them utterance”, to speak foreign languages. (Acts 2:4) Through Jesus Christ at his right hand God poured out his spirit upon the disciples. He radioed it down upon them, so causing them to utter speech in foreign phrase, just as a radio transmitting station can make loud-speakers of radio sets produce speech, music and sounds when such sets are tuned in on the radio station miles off. Whatever the electrical energies or impulses pick up at the radio station, or, so to speak, whatever they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hear</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> at the station, they send out to radio receiving sets, causing such to speak accordingly. In like manner, whatever the spirit of God </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hears</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> it speaks to the disciples.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Like jagged rocks hidden under water that rip vessels or swimmers unsuspectedly, the Devil’s agents who sneak in make a showy pretense of love for the brethren to cover their selfish, unclean motives. They used to frequent the love-feasts in Jude’s day and to mix in with God’s people and partake of their feast. Today we have conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses of an international, national, district and circuit kind. These allow for the brethren to sit down to a spiritual table primarily to hear God’s Word and service discussed and to do his will unitedly. These are far more effective and upbuilding than the old-time lovefeasts. Yet, even at these profitable gatherings the Devil tries to infiltrate some of his servants of evil design, to catch unstable souls off guard.

Those already engaged in it are encouraging and helping others into it, because to confess God and Christ by sharing in the ministry means life to the minister and his hearers. These thousands upon thousands of consecrated people of God are being helped to make the Christian ministry their real life’s vocation. Then their secular businesses and activities that they have to carry on become just the secondary operation of their life. If we appreciate God’s kingdom as the most important thing in the universe, how could we make being its ambassador and proclaimer secondary to our less important, selfish, personal occupations for material gain? We can not do so. If we consecrate to obey God with Christlike obedience, then we can not sidestep it: we are sent to do the Lord’s witness work. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Render all the better service if now the one getting the benefit of our good workmanship is a believer and so a beloved brother. Love of our Christian brother and neighbor is shown by not taking advantage of his Christlike mildness and rendering less service than that for which the job pays us. It is our employer that gets the advantage of our good work, and if he is now a Christian brother we should be all the more eager to deliver good service. In fact, the whole organization or enterprise benefits by our good service; and this means improved returns for us indirectly. Neither our godliness nor that of others is to be used as a way of making selfish gain. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only the men had a part in preparing things for the tabernacle, but also the women. They were not called to do the work ordinarily performed by men, but the privilege of tabernacle service that God measured out to them was according to what womenfolk might customarily or suitably do. Yet it required special skill and deserved the superior use of their talents, and there is where God’s spirit could be expected to come to their aid. And it did. The hearts of the women stirred them up to do the spinning. Also God’s spirit stirred up the generosity of his people. So sufficient supplies were provided for the construction project, and all the needed workers having talents were provided. All through their activities God’s spirit promoted and assisted the abilities of the workers.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unto them on the one hand who by way of endurance in good work are seeking glory, honour and incorruption, life age-abiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord Jesus Christ does not remain alone in possessing the prize of immortality from his heavenly Father. The prize of immortality is held before his body of faithful followers, his “bride”. Not even faithful Christians possess immortality on earth. If they did, they could not die, “faithful unto death.” After proving their faithfulness to death these genuine followers of Christ enter into immortality and incorruptibility with him in heaven only at his second coming, when Jehovah God sets up the Kingdom with him in the throne. At that time the King Christ Jesus raises his faithful followers from the dead. Thus it is only by a resurrection from death to life as spirit creatures that these faithful ones enter into immortality, clothed upon with incorruptibility. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth. —Mark</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2.-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">10, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus has authority to forgive sins in a fuller measure now since he has sacrificed his human life and has ascended back to heaven and has appeared in God’s presence there to present the redemptive value or merit of his human sacrifice. When on earth he made people well whose sins he forgave. He said it is just as easy to heal sickness as to say, “Your sins are forgiven.” Just so now when forgiving the believers their sins from heaven, he could make them perfect in flesh at once according to their forgiven condition and their sincere desire for righteousness. But he does not do so, because those whom God accepts at his High Priest’s hands for membership in the true Christian congregation are given an imputation of righteousness through Christ’s righteousness, because of their faith. On such grounds they can lay down their life in God’s service in imitation of Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No, we will not take the shortsighted human viewpoint and say God is slow. He is long-suSering for our sake, not wishing any to perish, but all to come to repentance. For those who sincerely repent by turning from this doomed world and taking up the pure worship of God and service of his King this repentance leads to salvation. The remnant must yet make their calling and election sure, but, in fact, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Jehovah’s witnesses today must abide in the saved condition into which they are brought, and in that condition they must seek to help others to salvation. We understand the purpose of God in not yet having brought on the great day like a thief when the present wicked heavens and earth of Satan’s organization will be consumed as by fire. We accept Peter’s counsel and “look upon our Lord’s patience as salvation”.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Live upright lives among the heathen, . . . even if they charge you with being evildoers.—1 Pet. 2:12, A..A..T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because Jehovah’s witnesses do not violate their consciences or disobey God’s law, the earthly governments have cast them off as a peculiar people, not orthodox, hard to deal with. Yet, all in all, they observe that they are honest, upright people, persons of good habits and easy for their neighbors to get along with. However, this being honest, upright, and loving one’s neighbors as oneself does not suit the rabble-rousers of the world. Preaching peace and prosperity under God’s kingdom is not supporting or being part of a political or religious organization. ‘If these people are left alone,’ they say, ‘the whole world will be following them.’ The rulers of the nations then say, ‘Stop their talk!’ They are not subversive, but in every nation Jehovah’s witnesses are juggled around to suit their oppressors. The point in common is, Annihilate Jehovah’s witnesses; get rid of them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The King Christ Jesus is the foretold One respecting whom Jehovah has had proclaimed to the end of the earth, for the benefit of the daughter of Zion, “Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.” (Isa. 62:11) He is the One bringing salvation from Jehovah for all those giving faith and loyalty to him. He is the Signal lifted up for the peoples, and on this account Jehovah has the proclamation made to the very ends of the earth that all peoples may hear and all meek, believing ones may gather to the Signal which stands up on top of Zion, the established kingdom of God. He is the Signal for all such to draw near and unitedly take their stand on the side of the kingdom of God by Christ. The raising of the fixed Sign or Signal marks the beginning of a great gathering of people from all over earth to the support of the kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 and the Father are one.—John 10:30. Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus did not say he and his Father are one God, so as to make one God in two persons. In all the parable of the sheep Jesus was not arguing in support of such a thing. He was rather illustrating that his heavenly Father and he have a likeness of occupation, they have common interests and concerns, and they have one purpose, Jesus’ purpose being blended in with that of his Father. He informs us that the Father gave him the sheep and hence Jehovah is the Great Shepherd. Jesus was “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”, as John the Baptist called him. Jehovah was therefore a Shepherd even to Jesus, and a shepherd is greater than his sheep. Jehovah let Jesus be “brought as a lamb to the slaughter”, where he was dumb without complaint, just like a “sheep before her shearers”. (John 1:29; Isa. 53:7) So, at Psalm 23: 1, the shepherd-psalmist in reality spoke for Jesus, when he said: “Jehovah is my shepherd.”—A.S.F. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus of Nazareth . . . was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.—Luke 24:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It would have been contrary to God’s law through Moses for Jesus and his apostles to adopt the holy official garments of Israel’s high priest, underpriests and Levites. Without even a prophet’s rough hairy garment, but in the ordinary dress of the common people, Jesus carried out his ministry as Jehovah’s high priest, prophet and witness. When he died on the tree as our ransom sacrifice, his garments over which the Roman soldiers cast lots did not include any long robe or collar buttoning to the rear or vest zipping up the back. His ministerial capacity was proved, not by man-made titles nor by Levite or prophetical garb, but by his preaching, his deeds, his constancy in God’s service, his keeping integrity till death. The ministerial office of Jehovah’s witnesses today is proved in the same Christlike way. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Souls</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> here refers to the future life in the new world. We must yet acquire this future life, or soul, and the way to gain possession of it is to prove worthy of it by our patient endurance in God’s service regardless of the hatred and persecution by all men and nations. This is what Jesus meant in the prophecy on the end of the world when he said: “Ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Mark 13:13) We must maintain our faith to the end of our trial in this world; we must hold on to our faithfulness to God to the finish of our testing, if we would make sure of our salvation. (1 Pet. 1: 9) If we now hope to see the final end of this corrupt world of Satan in the approaching battle of Armageddon, we must endure down to its end in order to prove worthy to be carried alive through the battle into the righteous new world that follows. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.—Prov. 22:11,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The good and honest heart that receives the message must bring forth fruit, and that fruitage can be attained only by preaching. The message of salvation that encounters a hearer must go from the ears to the heart and then to the lips. This circuit of movement is shown in the proverb above. Thus the words of the message of salvation must be established upon the lips of the hearer, that he may speak them repeatedly, upon every proper occasion. Preach, preach, preach, says God’s Word to us hearers. (Matt. 10:27,28) It is wise for the hearer to preach. Repeating deepens the impression within him of what he has heard. In that manner the hearer does not let slip away the things heard and thereby come in for punishment. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The religious clergy of Christendom’s hundreds of denominations disclaim Jehovah’s witnesses and loudly proclaim that these were not ordained by them and have no recognized standing with them. That is good! That is Scriptural; for the genuine ministers are not made by men or religious clergy. That was what the apostle Paul claimed as true in regard to himself. The gospel of which he was a minister was not according to man, and he did not get it of man, but was taught it by the revelation of Jesus Christ. (Gal. 1:11-17) He ministered this pure gospel of salvation. By doing so he served as Christ’s instrument in the work of reconciling other persons to Jehovah God. (2 Cor. 5:18) All this service aided the believers into membership in the church, Christ’s body; so that the apostle spoke of himself as a servant of the church, saying: “The church: whereof I am made a minister.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">On some have mercy, who are in doubt.—-Jude 22, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If we keep ourselves in God’s love, we may look for mercy to he multiplied to ns. God will extend this to us through our Lord Jesus Christ. We continually need it, for we are still in the imperfect flesh. This continuance of his mercy to us means everlasting life in the end, for through it we are forgiven our sins and restored to divine favor. We ourselves expect further mercy. So we must be merciful to others whose eternal life is at stake. Persons of evil design slip in among God’s people and try to make some of us unsteady, uncertain and full of doubts as to whether this is the truth, the Lord’s work, the Lord’s organization. Jude says to pity and have mercy on those who have been made to waver and doubt. Patiently seek to build them up again in the faith once delivered to the saints. We must act quickly, now that we are in the day when judgment begins at the house of God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not any more faith than in the days of Noah before the flood. If we consider the sore persecution that has come upon the upholders of true, unadulterated faith since A.D. 1914, this is a time of struggle and testing. To mark this as a time of special proving of our adherence to the true faith, Revelation, chapter 13, describes the Devil’s visible organization as a wild beast and says: “Whoever is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes: whoever kills with the sword, by the sword must he be killed. This is what shows the patience and the faith of the saints.” (Rev. 13:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Now the “other sheep” as well as the remnant must show good endurance and unbreakable adherence to the faith once for all delivered to the saints. As we cling together in the Lord, we strengthen and uphold one another to do so. Beholding our steadfastness, others take courage to adopt this faith and the number of “sheep” goes on increasing. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We know that anyone who is born of God does not sin; He who was born of God preserves him, and the evil One never catches him.—1 John 5:18, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If we do not pursue a course of sin for the pleasure of it, but seek to do righteousness, God will keep us. The wicked one, Satan the Devil, will not be able to catch firm hold of us, though often he assault us and put temptation before us. All the world is already lying in the powerful grip of the wicked one, but we are of God and abiding in him. For this reason the wicked one would like to catch unbreakable hold of us by inducing us to turn from God’s light and goodness and willfully take up the self-indulgent practice of sin. That would mean sin to the second death. “There is a sin unto death.” (5:16) Our determined choice is to advance steadily in truth and righteousness to glorious perfection. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also —2 Tim. 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Before this “time of the end” began, one of our main objectives was to teach others that they might carry on in our stead after we had finished our earthly course. But now our teaching others is not merely to have others succeed us as teachers and preachers after our death. It is to help others become God’s ministers now, that they may by God's mercy live through this “time of the end”, survive the destruction of this world at Armageddon and keep on ministering to God forever in the righteous new world to follow, without a break in their ministry. The Scriptures show the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is a society of ministers that teaches others to be His ministers of the gospel. Only his ministers have any hope of surviving Armageddon.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It is not everyone who can accept that, but only those who have a special gift.—Matt. 19:11, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To retain his hold on the gift of singleness, Paul absorbed himself in God’s work. He did not say, ‘I’d like to have the gift,’ but at the same time weaken the force of his wish by interesting himself in a particular one of the opposite sex and cultivate close intimacy with that one. No; he went after what he set before him, the gift, and he accepted all the self-denials and things required for enjoying it. He made room for it in his thoughts, plans and arrangements for the future. It is a practicable thing, and he went after it in a practical way, honest with himself. The gift was accordingly given him. In view of his gift, so many responsibilities were laid upon him by the Lord that he had no time for considering marriage. He realized he could not have measured up to his responsibilities if he had constant care of a wife. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Simon Magus was not wise enough to see that handing over money to buy something for a selfish purpose could not be acceptable to God or be an act of friendship. Using money without a loving service to God along with it could never buy God as Friend so that God would give special powers and position in this life. We can not enrich God by giving him what is already his own. (Hag. 2:8) What he wants is our love and devotion. By applying our money in his service in the way he prescribes we show our love for him and hence such use of money is different from Simon’s use. Not by showing selfishness in trying to get something from him for ourselves by money; but by showing loving appreciation and devotion to God in the employment of our material wealth, even be it by a widow’s mite, in this unselfish way do we show ourselves friendly to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and thus make friends with them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By the hope set before them in God’s revealed Word the “great multitude” of “other sheep” know what to look for, and they are overjoyed and sustained by the vivid hope of eternal life on earth under God’s kingdom. In 1935 through Jesus Christ he revealed to all his consecrated ones on earth that the “great multitude” of Revelation, chapter 7, is a human class with an earthly eternity ahead of them under the kingdom of Jesus Christ with his 144,000. This flash of truth cast clearer brightness upon the earthly hope for this multitude of consecrated servants of God and Christ. These hailed it with joy as the hope that Jehovah God set before them for their comfort, joy and Sustaining strength. Theirs is a hope from God’s Word, illuminated by the revealing power of his spirit. It is their valid hope. With good reason they hold it fast, in expectation of fully realizing it in His time. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W If! 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 13:2-4, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Just what personal agency the holy spirit used here to give orders respecting Paul and Barnabas is not stated. It may have been an angel from heaven, as when sending three men from the centurion Cornelius to the apostle Peter; or it may have been a prophet of the Antioch congregation. The prophet Agabus could have spoken under the power of the holy spirit, for we read: “There stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world.” (Acts 11:27,28) Consequently, since the orders to send out Paul and Barnabas as missionaries were given under the power of God’s holy spirit, these two men were, indeed, sent forth by the holy spirit, though the spirit is not a person. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oh worship Jehovah in holy array.—Ps. 96:9, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot give Jehovah God too much direct worship in this world. His worship is to our advantage. The more we properly worship him according to truth and with the help of his spirit, the more our interest grows in vindicating his universal sovereignty, name and Word. The more, too, we are training our minds in the right direction. As we expand our ministry of worship we find our love for our neighbors deepening, for more of them. We get in touch with more of such “other sheep”, we gain many more friends, Christian brethren, people for whom we can show love, people we can help and train in God’s true worship, in which we are already engaged. Ah, yes, we can help these dear ones to gain life, getting into the same righteous way into which we have been brought by others’ ministry. Can getting uncertain material riches compare with the rewards attending our efforts at gathering together the Lord’s “other sheep”?

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The spirit or active force from God acted upon holy men before Christ and they spoke and wrote as moved by it, to produce the inspired Hebrew Scriptures. God anointed Jesus with his holy spirit, and at Pentecost A.D. 33 Jesus, having returned to his heavenly Father, poured out the spirit upon his followers. A number of apostles and disciples wrote the Greek Scriptures by that spirit, to make up our complete Bible of today. From that spirit-produced Book the life-giving waters of truth from the throne of God and of Christ flow out. By the spirit we have revealed to us the Kingdom news for this time of the end. It brings increase of knowledge and a grasp of things never before seen, heard or perceived by men. That same spirit has been poured out upon the remnant in the flesh of the Bride class, and with its help they extend the invitation to all nations to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the Kingdom water of life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 16/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 3:16, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Despite the refusal of most natural Jews to receive him as the Greater Moses, Jesus proved his godliness by remaining loyally devoted to his Superior, his Sender. Down to his death he carried out the earthly mission upon which he was sent. In his earthly life in the flesh he found godliness to be the way of gaining his heavenly Father’s approval and blessings and all the privileges of acting as His witness and minister. But when resurrected he found that godliness on earth had been the means of gaining vindication in the spirit and gaining the heavenly blessings to which this vindication had introduced him. His godliness proved to be the most beneficial course, both in this life and in the life to come. It was, indeed, the means of lasting gain. It has always been such. Jesus’ gain recommends that way of life also to us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has let his remnant see many a sore trial. In 1918, at the climax of World War I, it looked like disaster for them, one from which they would never arise. They were then under oppressions and captivity by the murderous powers of this world, so that they were like the pile of dry bones in the deep valley that Ezekiel saw in vision after Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jewish captives were displaced. (Ezek. 37:1-14) But in the vision God quickened that valley of dry bones to life again, and he did so with his faithful remnant in 1919. He brought them up from the depths of captivity and restraint under earthly rulers. He turned his favor again to them and increased their greatness as his witnesses and ambassadors. He has comforted them also by raising up at their side a great multitude of consecrated companions of good-will, the new, rising generation.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In obedience to the divine commands for this day, Jehovah’s witnesses put forth every effort to push forward the principles of truth and righteousness and to turn the minds of the people toward the one true Deity and his gracious Word, the Bible. This they will continue to do right on down to the final war, the long-predicted Armageddon. Come opposition, trials, persecution and other troubles from governments or their agents, they will move ahead fearlessly and courageously, standing for Jehovah’s “King of kings”, Christ Jesus. They are one people. They look to Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ, as “The Higher Powers” who are guiding and directing their activities. They are not serving any man or any worldly organization. The organization they have is a God-directed organization, or Theocratic, and its members are interested solely in lasting peace and good-will. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.—1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By all evidences in this world, the antitypical Egypt, we are at the ends of the systems of things which have marked this world. Hence the warning examples in Scripture were written for the admonition of us particularly. We do well to remember that the hundreds of thousands under Moses that were saved from Egypt included a large “mixed multitude” of non-Israelites of good-will. On one occasion in the wilderness it was this mixed multitude that started the Israelites to faultfinding about the lack of flesh food, so that Jehovah provided great flocks of quail, for a month’s supply at least. Consequently the warning of the examples recorded in Scripture is for the admonition of the present-day “great multitude” of persons of goodwill as well as for the few remaining members of spiritual Israel.—Num. 11:4. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W h/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.—Prov. 25:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The person with understanding will not resent reproof, and will not take offense at his reprover and avoid him with ill-feeling. The reprover that administers the reproof from God and according to his Word is to be valued and viewed as an adornment to the person reproved. He is precious, and the obedient person will appreciate the reprover as an adornment to his ear, as a beautiful earring. So let us take God’s reproof through his Word and his organization. For our ear to be really a hearing ear we must honestly try to put into effect that which we have heard. The obedient ear is the hearing ear. Hearing does not mean merely to catch the sound of what is said and thereafter to pay no attention to it. It means to keep or observe the sayings heard. Because her rulers and people refused to hear, destruction came upon Jerusalem. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God . . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">condemned sin in the flesh.—Rom. 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That being so, when Jehovah God created the first man from whom wc all have sprung, he created him perfect and not missing in any one of his proper human parts and qualities. Moreover, instead of appointing man from the start to an existence of unavoidable wretchedness and misery God put Adam in the garden of Eden; and this name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eden</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">delight</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">pleasantness.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> All this disproves the religious lie that God could not produce anything on this earth but wretched, miserable, imperfect creatures, and that all this world of matter is just an evil development, and the best thing for us to do is to try to make our escape from it forever. God condemns the sin that has come to exist in the flesh. For this reason in the world to come he will people this earth with innocent, sinless, perfect people. He will not approve of any other kind of population to inhabit this earth forever. He will therefore remove the “sin of the world”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy people shall be willing.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In one way or another all the consecrated ones whom God calls into service as his witnesses have some natural abilities. So what is needed is their willinguess to put these to work in his service. These abilities must be used as the foundation upon which to build. They must not be left idle and neglected, but cultivated. If we apply ourselves to using them in God’s service according to the instructions he gives through his organization and Word, then they will receive development, God’s spirit acting as an energizing force. The thing to do is to get started. Get going! Take hold of the service, trusting God to direct the course our efforts should take. In due time we shall get the gift of the desired ability, whether it be that of prophesying (telling forth the written prophecies), teaching, acting as an overseer, door-to-door publisher, or other useful ability. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These . . . speak evil of dignities.—Jude 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What are the dignities against which they rail, blaspheme and speak abusively? Jude used a Greek word meaning </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">glories, honors.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hence he must refer to persons who hold or occupy glories and honors. All such things come from God through his King Jesus Christ, and properly no credit is to be given the favored persons on earth who enjoy them. Yet they are to be respected for it and treated and spoken of accordingly, with chief regard for God, who says: “Them that honour me I will honour.” (1 Sam. 2:30) God has especially honored his remnant since A.D. 1918. As we read: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">glory</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Jehovah is risen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1, A.S.V.) It is a glory to shine thus for the Lord God. The enlightened remnant, letting the glorious light shine by proclaiming the Kingdom gospel in an organized way, are to be respected, because God made this possible by shining his glorious light upon them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish.—2 Pet. 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why has God not wiped out the wicked world organization before now? The reason why is, He is exercising still further patience with the nations that he might save his anointed remnant and all the people of good-will that are to be found among the nations. Today the remnant and all the consecrated people of good-will associated with them number more than 260,733 active throughout the world. No, not many, in comparison with the world population. But God’s patience and long-suffering toward the nations with all their aggravated godlessness since 1918 have meant the salvation of all these hundreds of thousands. If this has been the gratifying result of his forbearance and patience up till now, what will his further extended patience mean but salvation of others?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass on that day that the root of Jesse, who will be standing as a signal to the peoples—to him will the nations resort.—Isa. 11:10, A..A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This prophecy firmly establishes it that Christ Jesus the King is the great Signal that is lifted up for the peoples, for he is the Son of David and the grandson of Jesse, according to the flesh. He was even foreshadowed by King David, the direct son of Jesse. More than a grandson or descendant of David’s father Jesse, Christ Jesus is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">root of Jesse,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the main reason why that God-fearing man Jesse and his son David came into existence was rooted in the divine promise to produce Messiah or Christ. Because David was directly the son of Jesse he was used as a type of Jesus Christ. However, in a far more vital sense Jesus Christ is the “root of Jesse” in that he died for Jesse and all other God-fearing faithful men. So Jesse’s hope of living again is rooted in Christ Jesus, who will raise him and David from the dead. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the hook of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.—Rev. 13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God laid the foundation for a new world of enduring peace and righteousness nineteen centuries ago. That sure foundation was laid through the death of his Son, the Messiah. For such reason the Revelation, when foretelling the political arrangements of today for world domination, speaks of Messiah as “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world”. Persons who fail to worship him in this time of judgment upon the nations have nothing in the Bible to indicate they will live clear through the “great tribulation” in which this world will end. Rather, their consignment to destruction is foretold. Those who do worship him as the slain Lamb of God whose death provided a sin-offering are the only ones entitled to any hope of surviving and passing alive into the new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It is impossible to arouse people to a fresh repentance when they have once for all come into the light . . . and yet have fallen back.—Heb. 6: 4-6, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Back to what can the falling away of this relapser into sin be traced? To his being unwilling to continue making due progress in the light and bringing forth the fruit of light. He lets selfishness creep in little by little, and, not wanting to take on the responsibility of greater light and have to spend himself further in reflecting the light, he halts. But the advancing light does not halt with him. Neither do the faithful ones walking in the light halt. And so he gets left behind. It makes it harder for him to catch up again, and the forward movement of the organization without him tends to make him feel hurt and then bitter. As he does not want his conscience to be pricked with feelings of being responsible to God for past mercies and favors, he finds it more comfortable for him to associate with the world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The angels who abandoned their own domain, instead of preserving their proper rank, are reserved by him within the nether gloom, in chains eternal, for the doom of the great day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 6, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We are men, made a little lower than the angels. (Ps. 8: 5) Tet, because angels are free moral agents as ourselves and mortal, they are not free from all possibility of falling to their destruction. Their having access to God and beholding the face of our heavenly Father is a blessed privilege that they have, but even from this high estate in life they can fall. What false step led many to this terrible result? It was their departing from the clean, holy condition in which God created them and departing from the responsible place in his heavenly organization to which he had assigned them. In the world before the Flood they materialized. They wanted close fleshly associations. So angels fell to destruction. We could do so. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Timothy had a gift by the spirit of God. It was conferred upon him for use. He must not neglect it, if he wanted to be faithful and did not want to receive God’s grace in vain and waste the gift. It must be applied to the work intended, yes, be cultivated, be improved, perfected by practical use. He had to go at the work with faith in God. If there is a work to be done in the organization of God’s people, and if those in authority select us to do it or encourage us to take part in it, then we should undertake it. We must use what abilities and knowledge we already have. We can rely upon God to help us by his spirit. He will fulfill his prophecy and do so. Eventually, if we earnestly persist at the assigned work with a will, his blessing will reward us with the gift of ability for the work. Progress will show itself. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ye are the light of the world.—Matt. 5:14-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All together, the Kingdom publishers constitute the “light of the world”. If it were not for them, no light of truth about Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ would be going out into the world today, and it would be necessary for ‘the stones to cry out’t “The field is the world,” Jesus said; and all of us throughout the earth, by unitedly sounding out the one message and mutually supporting one another, are covering the entire field of the world with the gospel of salvation. Each individual, no matter how isolated, must make a contribution of service; each must constantly sustain his part of the work in his territory. Each publisher shining locally, when combined with all his fellow publishers throughout the earth, creates a great blaze of light that is penetrating in every direction and serving notice upon all nations that God has set up his kingdom by Christ. In consequence of all this activity the great sign proving the end of this world is being fulfilled.—Matt. 24: 14. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The question of supremacy is here involved and must be openly settled, because Moses said there is only one Jehovah, not three Jehovahs. Hence, Is Jehovah supreme as the Most High God? (Deut. 6:4) In establishing the kingdom of God it is Jehovah that puts his Son Jesus Christ upon the throne to reign and thereby blesses Him. This is pictured at Revelation 12: 5 as the catching up of the newborn man-child “up unto God, and to his throne”, where he must rule all nations, the eastern and western blocs thereof, with a “rod of iron”, to dash them all to pieces at the final war of Armageddon. His being enthroned by Jehovah God both argues and demands that Christ Jesus be subordinate and not equal to Jehovah. The apostle Paul states the rule: “Without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.”—Heb. 7:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay. W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The friendships worth making are not with the unrighteous, dishonest, or ill-gotten mammon or wealth. We cannot serve God and mammon. The love of mammon or money is a root of all evil. (Luke 16:13; 1 Tim. 6: 10) We cannot, therefore, be seeking the friendship of the wealthy ones of this world, the big landlords and the real estate concerns. We must be seeking the friendship of those who can give us more than material possessions, namely, eternal dwellings, permanent homes. Those able to provide us with such things are Jehovah God the great Builder of all things and Jesus Christ his Son, who said to his disciples: “I go to prepare a place for you.” If we desire to live in happiness for all eternity, these are the ones with whom to make friends; and to do so we should use what mammon or worldly wealth we have in this life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Even if the Israelites did all share in common in such mercies from God that were for their salvation, did they all enter into the promised “land of milk and honey”? All having onee been saved from the first world power, Egypt, were they all saved even as far as the Promised Land? Paul knew the Scriptural answer. He took the warning to himself and drew it to the notice of his brethren, lest, for lack of self-control, they fall to the same temptations as those Israelites did and in that way ruin their chance of eternal salvation. Paul writes: “I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.”—1 Cor. 9: 27, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Amos 8:11, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Owing to the unfaithfulness of Christendom’s clergy as ministers of Christ, which they claim to be, just such a famine for hearing the word of Jehovah God exists throughout the world. The clergy responsible for this should not consider themselves free from blame for the thriving of Communism and its growing menace to the world. They turn down Jehovah’s Word and fight His witnesses that spread his Word. Hence the vision from the Lord has vanished from the clergy, and Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones bringing real relief to the peoples of all nations. Those who hear Jehovah’s Word which his witnesses minister receive the only effective bulwark against the advance of any Godless “ism” into their lives. By spreading the life-saving knowledge of Jehovah and his kingdom by Christ we are pushing the relief from spiritual famine. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

It is now a day of great deceptions respecting the most controversial issue, God’s kingdom by his Christ, the King Jesus; and we must therefore watch out not to listen to the self-seeking, self-exalting deceivers. Those who have ears to hear what Jesus Christ himself says will obey him and will take heed as to what they hear and accept. They hear the scripture say to them: “The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.” (Joh 34:3; 12: 11) God so made the structure of the ear that it can distinguish a great variety of sounds and can detect the genuineness in the ring of sounds and voices. It must test words as to whether they have the ring of genuine truth coming from the reliable Source. It must listen for the voice of the true shepherds and must respond only to them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God the Holy One anointed Jesus with holy spirit; and since he used the spirit as an anointing upon Jesus, it proves that the spirit is not a person. Further showing the spirit is no person but is an active force from God, John speaks of this outpoured spirit as an unction or anointing. It is God the Holy One that has anointed the disciples with his spirit through Jesus Christ, and thus it is God that has taught and is teaching them by means of the spirit of his anointing. To continue to receive such teaching by means of His spirit, Christians must abide in God, in unity with him. Then he will not remove his spirit from them. The spirit does not have to be an intelligent corporeal person for them to be taught thus, but whatever God sends them on the carrier wave of his spirit, that is what they are taught. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the latest, Moses began writing his book in 1513 B.C., after the battle of Rephidim which occurred a few weeks after he led the Israelites out of Egypt. Since the Lord had decided upon him to do the writing, He would see to it that Moses had the records from the creation forward for consultation and compiling, so as to write up one connected account for God’s people, the children of Israel, in the language that they understood and in the script that they could read. Those ancient records, in writing, were as a Bible to Moses in Egypt. They were like “oracles of God” that were committed to him to hold in sacred trust and to use according to God’s will. Moses was to write those things of which he was an eyewitness, and the written records that he consulted for compiling </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Genesis</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> were those of eyewitnesses. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

Those who maintain their perfection and sinlcssncss by unwavering loyalty to God’s King will have their names written in the book of life. That means their justification, their being declared unswervingly righteous and worthy of the right to everlasting life. Thus will be fulfilled Revelation 20:5. Satan, who tries to deceive and overturn that new world, will be punished with “second death”, his everlasting destruction, with no future interruption. (20:10) Thus Christ Jesus will prove to be a “king, against whom there is no rising up”, and the new world will go on without end, proving to be forever stable in vindication of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty.—Prov. 30:29,31. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses today are like the apostle Paul in that they do not need a letter written in ink by someone to prove they are ministers of the gospel. The 230,532 witnesses of Jehovah who were out in the field during 1948 have a letter of commendation which is a real recommendation of their faithful ministry, for they had aided many more publishers of the Kingdom to associate with them. There are many more now that are showing zeal for the only righteous cause, which will succeed. By the recommendations written in the hearts of those who love the Kingdom all the world knows Jehovah’s witnesses have proof of their ministry, but it is not what Christendom calls “orthodox”. Whether orthodox or unorthodox, they do their work like Jesus. They are not peddlers of God’s message, like most men. They are devoting their time, money, strength, their all, in the service of God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We of the remnant want to be safeguarded against stumbling into destruction. We want Jesus Christ to resurrect us from the dead to present us in spiritual perfection before the glorious presence of God with exceeding joy. Since that is so, we must attribute to Jehovah God glory, majesty, dominion and power. If we ascribe these things to him now when he has taken his majestic Kingdom authority over all the earth, we will order our lives in harmony and will bear witness to him. Then he will keep us from falling and bring us into the heavenly kingdom. All persons of good-will wanting to stand approved for eternal life in the new world must also now ascribe glory, majesty, dominion and authority to the only God.

If God’s Word and spirit abide in them, then His seed abides in them and they will not make a deliberate practice of sin. They lead clean lives by the help of his spirit and his purifying Word. Their hope, based upon God’s Word, is not a mere mental exercise, but is an active, motivating force in their lives, a purifying hope. “Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/15</span></p>

Jesus was a perfect man, but because of our imperfection we his followers need orders and instructions all the more. He went whithersoever sent. Are we following his example by willingly going whithersoever sent in the great field, the world, to take part in the great expansion of Christian education? A servant is not greater than his master, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. A servant should be satisfied to become like his master, and a pupil like his teacher; and we should not be afraid or ashamed to be ambassadors and servants of God any more than our Master and Teacher Jesus Christ was. Being sent, we ought to comply with orders gladly, because we have them from the right source.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 1:16, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said: “Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him.” There could be some excuse for speaking thus, because one could be ignorant of the true facts about him that fulfilled the prophecies identifying him as the promised Messiah. For example, Saul of Tarsus was a most earnest Pharisee and spoke and acted against the Son of man, and yet he became the apostle Paul. Despite all the sins he committed against the Son of man and that made him appear as the “chief” of sinners, he was not beyond repentance. Why not? Because he did not resist knowledge of the truth. He was willing to learn and make progress into light. Hence he was an example of how other sinners against Christ might be shown their wrong path and might repent and go right. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

Since the day our fathers fell asleep, things remain exactly as they were from the beginning of creation.” (2 Pet. 3:3,4) We will not count God as slow and never getting to the performance of his promises. We know there is a limit to his patience, and that he has appointed a definite time for the battle of Armageddon. When the time for this final feature of the days of tribulation comes, then his patience toward the “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction” will end. As long as he yet pleases, we will endure the scoffing and mocking at our hopes and our warnings to the world.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The holy scriptures . . . are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith.—2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What every one must have to be a complete and qualified minister is the Scriptures and an understanding of them. Certainly to help others to become wise to salvation we ourselves must study the Scriptures and know and understand them to impart the meaning of them to others. God has not made ignorance the way to salvation, and does not sanctify us by ignorance, but by the truth. (John 17:17) Hence we must study the Scriptures with the help of all that God provides through his Theocratic organization to aid our understanding. Our study and meditation are not merely to gain our own salvation but also to be teachers of others that they too may win salvation. We should definitely purpose to be teachers as a result of our study and meditation. After a time of such study and meditation God expects us to be teachers and preachers. “For the time ye ought to be teachers.”—Heb. 5:12. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> [or, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">digged; pierced]: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 40: 6,7, margin; Heb. 10:5-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s own Son, Jesus Christ, was a servant who loved his heavenly Father to such an extent that he refused to forsake His service, although Satan and the demons under him tried all ways to force Jesus to do so. Even the offering up of himself in sacrifice in God’s service and for mankind’s ransom did not make Jesus quit his heavenly Master’s service. He continued to turn to his God and Father a blood-marked ear and let it be bored or digged to indicate he was Jehovah’s willing servant for evermore. (Deut. 15:12-17) For such obedience and unbreakable devotion to God his Father, he has been made Jehovah’s Chief Servant or Prime Minister, because he is absolutely dependable out of his love for God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.—Acts 2: 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. That means, with faith and reliance upon him as God’s Seed for our deliverance. By faith in him whose heel was bruised we obtain from God the remission or forgiveness of sins. At Pentecost the baptism in water of about 3,000 souls did not itself procure forgiveness for them, but was a token of such forgiveness. The water baptism was in reality an open confession of their turning from enmity to God and his Seed and their dedicating or consecrating themselves to him through the Seed, whom they now named or confessed Jesus to be. Through him they called upon the name of Jehovah that they might be saved. Calling upon his name meant not merely crying out to Jehovah for help and rescue, but also publicly confessing him to others, preaching his gospel of salvation through Jesus, and so making them acquainted with Jehovah God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do not lay hands hastily upon anyone, and do not be a partner in other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.—1 Tim. 5: 22,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cath. Confrat. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Christian is under no necessity to choose or vote for the lesser of two evils and to work to improve it. He chooses neither of the two evils, for both are of this world and he does not choose to share in the responsibility for prolonging either of the two. According to this rule Bible Christians have refused to lay hands of approval upon any politician of this world. They have thereby refused to take part in the responsibility for sins such politician, as, for instance, Hitler or Mussolini, has later committed in office. Those who faithfully follow Christ’s instructions keep themselves chaste or pure from this world, because he has chosen them out of it and they are no longer a part of it. They are for the new world, God’s world of righteousness. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be earnestly contending for the faith.—Jude 3, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All the consecrated members of God’s holy nation are called to his heavenly kingdom with Christ. They are heirs of a “common salvation” to that kingdom. But certain individuals onee members of the nation will not share in that common salvation. They may now be holding in common with other called ones a hope of final salvation, yet that is no certain guarantee that they will see that hope realized. Our being now in a saved condition is no reason for imagining we cannot be moved, forced or drawn out from that place of refuge and thereby not make our salvation eternal. For those who want to make their salvation a fully realized thing it is necessary to contend earnestly for the faith that saves, once for all delivered to God’s saints. Contention, or standing up in defense, is forced upon God’s people. He permits it to test the integrity and devotion of his holy nation to him. Testing makes them strong and immovable. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That Christ did not reign from the first century onward the apostles John and Paul plainly show. John wrote the Revelation toward the close of the first century and spoke of the 1000-year reign as yet future, as one of the “things which must shortly come to pass”. (Rev. 1:1) John outlived Paul. About A.D. 61, while at Rome, Paul wrote his letter to the Hebrews and said: “But now we see </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not yet</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> all things put under him.” (Heb. 2:8) Then, to show that Christ Jesus at his Father’s right hand in heaven did not yet have Satan under his feet but must wait in expectation for all his enemies to be made his footstool, Paul went on to say of the “man Christ Jesus” : “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Heb. 10:12,13. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Serve Jehovah with gladness.—Ps. 100:2, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no occupation or profession of more importance today than the Christian ministry of the Kingdom message. We cannot make our secular work, our social position in life, or the personal, selfish things we have to do or like to do more important than the things God has for us to do, if we are seeking eternal life in the new world. Why should we weigh matters when it comes to serving God? Is it not the right thing to do? Is it not what his Word instructs us to do if we want life through his Son Jesus Christ? Is it not the example his Son set tor us, which example he set for us to follow as a sure guide to eternal life? He said: “Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.” (Heb. 10:9) Do we also come to God for the same purpose? If we follow in Jesus’ footsteps, then we should be willing to do the things he did on earth; and his chief work was bearing witness and preaching the gospel. He was a minister of God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.—1 Cor.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Each one gets his gift by adapting himself to his situation, be he a slave under a master, or a person required to work part time to provide life’s needs for dependent ones, or a single person or a married person. That was why Paul went on to say that, if a married man or woman wants to take part in certain privileges in the Lord’s service, such person must to that extent act as if unmarried: “The appointed time has grown very short From this time on those who have wives should live as though they had none.” (7:29, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> If a married person does this, then a gift of service is given. Each one must study and plan how he can arrange matters under his circumstances so as to do something directly in God’s service. Then God will help him, and he will have a gift of service. He must cultivate the gift by seizing opportunities. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lamb is come.—Rev. 19:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should not all persons of good-will toward a bridegroom and bride be unusually glad at the time of their union? So, with gladness and rejoicing the antitypical damsels of Rebekah, the virgin companions, are brought into company with the bridal remnant. Unquestionably they are included in the “great multitude” reported at Revelation 19: 6-9, whose voice is heard saying: “Alleluia!” Jehovah God omnipotent took power and began reigning toward our earth A.D. 1914, but this “great multitude” have raised their Hallelujah song only since A.D. 1918, by which time the war in heaven had been won by Jehovah’s Bridegroom Son and Satan the ruler of Babylon had been cast out of heaven. Then the Son came to the temple and began pronouncing judgment upon Satan’s system of organized religion, Babylon the Great, mother of harlots. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.—Rev. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The slaying of the Lamb was the time when the foundation of the righteous new world was laid. This was not just at the time that Jesus of Nazareth presented himself to John the Baptist in 29 and was baptized. From then on Jesus began to be baptized into death. But his baptism into death was not finished at his water baptism in Jordan river, as is shown by his words to his disciples James and John just a few months before he was killed: “With the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized.” (Mark 10:39) A little earlier that same year he said to all his disciples: “I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!” (Luke 12:50) This baptism into death was not all accomplished, and hence his being slain as a Lamb was not all completed, until he was brought to the slaughterers at Calvary and died on the torture stake on Nisan 14 of the year 33. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He obtained a more excellent ministry.—Heb. 8:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After baptism how did Jesus act as a public servant or minister according to God’s will? By acting as a teacher of all the people, by preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom to the circumcised Jews and the Samaritans. He was in the fullest sense God’s servant for the people, because he did not go in for politics or commerce or the so-called “Jews’ religion”. He dedicated himself completely to proclaiming the written Word of God and explaining to the circumcised Jews the things concerning God’s kingdom in the light of those sacred Scriptures. For proclaiming the Kingdom message almost exclusively to such circumcised nation he could be called a “minister [or, public servant] of the circumcision for the truth of God”. (Rom. 15:8) As such he preached not only in public places, in the temple, in synagogues, in the out-of-doors, but also in the private homes of the people. He went from house to house to reach the people. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.—Rom. 8:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those Christians whom God has begotten to be his children as joint-heirs with Christ he has anointed with his spirit. This anointing or unction teaches them; and, by the things that it reveals to them from God’s written Word, it bears witness to them that they are His spiritual children. By his revealed Word God sets before these sons the hope of being joined with Jesus in the heavenly kingdom. Now, all of God’s written Word was produced under inspiration of his spirit (2 Tim. 3: 15-17) ; and so by this Word it is the holy spirit that is really testifying to these Christians that they are the begotten children of God. Also, by the spirit’s operations in their lives, just as in the lives of Peter, Paul and other disciples, the spirit bears further witness to them concerning their son-ship to God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God.—1 Pet. 1:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The seed of procreation by which Adam begot our race was corruptible seed, with corruption operating in it through sin, and bearing with it the condemnation of death. But when God the Father begets the consecrated believers of humankind to be spiritual sons or children, he begets them again by incorruptible seed. That is to say, he regenerates them by incorruptible means of giving life and existence, namely, the power of his spirit or active force. In order to see and enter the heavenly kingdom of God, they must be begotten anew or regenerated by His spirit or active force, as Jesus told Nicodemus. (John 3:3-6) Being thus given a start in spiritual life while in their corruptible flesh on earth, but continuing faithful to death, they will be fully born of the spirit in the resurrection. Then the body of 144,000 faithful followers of Christ “shall all be changed”.—1 Cor. 15: 51-53. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.—1 John 5:16, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The extreme penalty is death, here meaning the annihilation or destruction which Revelation 2: 11 and 20: 14 speak of as “the second death”. It is willful sin for which there is no forgiveness now or in the world to come. There is no sin-atoning sacrifice provided for it, the High Priest’s sacrifice covering only the sins due to our fallen, imperfect, weak estate inherited from Adam. It is sin by one’s own choice after coming to the knowledge of the truth. It is sin by one who has been enlightened and has tasted of God’s goodness and who cannot feel any repentance and who does not crave forgiveness, well knowing what he is doing. It is sin with the eyes wide open to the undeniable operation of God’s holy spirit or active force. It is unforgivable; and how can God answer the prayer for anyone to be forgiven such sin? So do not pray for anyone guilty of it.—Jer. 7:16. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Raise a signal over the peoples.—Isa. 62:10, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is that signal which must be lifted up for all peoples that seek freedom from this Babylonish world and that seek prosperity, peace, unity and the pure worship of God? That great upstanding signal of such prominence is </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s reigning Kino, Chbist Jesus ! </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He is the exalted sign or signal around which all of Jehovah’s witnesses, delivered from Babylon, assemble in earth-wide unity. Around him as Jehovah’s “high priest after the order of Melchixedek” we engage in the unifying worship of the Most High God, Jehovah. Christ Jesus, the glorious Signal, stands upon the lofty height of Mount Zion, the established kingdom of God. There he now reigns in the midst of his enemies to vindicate Jehovah’s right to universal sovereignty and to bless good-will persous out of all families and nations of the earth. (Rev. 14:1) Let us all join in exalting him with praise. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the Oues providing “eternal abodes”, there is no need to build houses now, and tie up money in them, just to prepare places for the lodging of the faithful dead whose return we expect by resurrection. If we faithfully apply our time, strength, and material riches to doing the things God now commands to be done for the getting of the Kingdom message to the poor of this world, then the Lord will take care of those whom he promises to bring back from the dead. Our being at the entry into the new world of righteousness reminds us of the time that Israel crossed the Jordan river into the Promised Land. There the Lord God provided them the dwelling-places, even the homes that enemies were obliged to vacate. Years later, Joshua testified God had given them such things. 17 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After his resurrection from the dead Jesus Christ declared that his Father and God gave him all the necessary power in heaven and in earth for his future work. However, such reception of power in heaven and in earth docs not make Christ Jesus all-powerful and almighty. Nowhere is Jesus Christ called the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pantokrator</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> or Almighty One; and neither is the “holy ghost”. Jehovah God the Father is alone the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pantokrator</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> or Almighty One. He bestows upon his Son Jesus Christ all the power or authority that he needs in heaven and earth to carry out his royal office. Along with this power or authority Jehovah God Almighty gives to Jesus Christ the holy spirit, and at Pentecost Jesus began to pour it forth on disciples.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We are all humans, just plain men and women as the Israelites and mixed multitude of the wilderness journey were. Therefore we are reachable by the same temptations that the Devil brought upon them. Surely, further temptations such as are common to all men, including those Israelites and mixed multitude, are ahead of us, and none of us can afford to become careless and indifferent. Yet we need not become discouraged and fear that we cannot come through the further trial period successfully. God’s purpose in saving us from this world through Jesus Christ is not just to destroy us in his wrath after a while. It is that we may win the glorious final salvation in the righteous new world. (1 Thess. 5: 8, 9; 2 Thess. 2:13) By winning eternal salvation we share in vindicating His name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because it is wise to preach the saving Word of God, wisdom is pictured as a person preaching God’s message “without”, “in the streets,” “in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city.’’ And such personified wisdom says: “Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.” (Prov. 1:20-33) We must give the message in the language that the people understand, in their tongue and on their level of intelligence, in order for the sounds of the message to be understandable to them. If we do not want to sound like a barbarian to those to whom we preach, we must give the witness to them in their understood language and in terms they can grasp.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The archangel Michael’s respect for the dignity and glory of Jehovah God was displayed here on earth when he became flesh as “the man Christ Jesus”. But dreamers that pretend to be his followers and who slip in among his true followers do not follow his example, even though they are so inferior to Michael. In blaspheming and speaking abusively of such dignities from God, these disrespectful persons are as animals that do not know what such things mean. They are animalistic still more in that they understand only what appeals to the passions of their flesh, and not to the mind and the faculty of reason. So, like an animal that minds only the flesh, they seek the satisfaction of the flesh.

He was always ready to be sent, to be put in service, to take orders from his Father. He was sent to do a work here. He received a commission from his Father, and he fulfilled it. He proved his love for his Father by being obedient. His heavenly Father made all arrangements for him. He did not figure these out for himself. He did not come of himself. He was sent. He was content to be here on earth for the time appointed for him, and did not think his Father had made a mistake. No matter what God told or taught him, he fulfilled his Father's words, because it was an act of true worship. It was a joy to him, because he was doing his Father’s will. He was not ashamed of being sent into the world as a subordinate and servant of God. He was glad to be an obedient minister. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The anointed remnant keep praying God not to forsake them till they have declared his strength and activities to the next generation, the Jonadab class, for their salvation. The remnant want to reach with the Kingdom message “every one that is to come”. In Jehovah’s due time he by his reigning King will bring forth from the grave the faithful prophets and other overcomers of pre-Christian centuries to make them “princes in all the earth”. Then the faithful remnant, who also expect to survive the battle of Armageddon, will have the privilege of telling these princes of the “new earth” about the arm and strength of Jehovah God at this end of the world.

At the same time they will not interfere in a violent combat between nations. They are neutral as to the political affairs and military operations of nations. They look to God as the One that gives life and has a right to take it away, and the One who can also preserve them into the new world of uprightness. They fully appreciate that God’s Word says his servants will come from every nation, tribe and tongue but that they will be one people to him, a chosen generation, devoted to peace, because of having his spirit. Knowing they are his chosen people under the one Theocratic law, they serve him with undivided attention. They have the proper fear of God, for they hate the evil of this world.

They are the small remnant who since 1918 have been making strenuous efforts to revive the knowledge of Jehovah and to make known his fame among the nations. Because of their persistent efforts and their faithfulness to his name and universal sovereignty, they have undergone great persecution from the religionists of Christendom. Who are they? Jehovah's remnant of anointed witnesses. Isaiah 61:5 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(A.S.V.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> also says: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.” These are the great multitude of consecrated persons of good-will who have made common cause with the anointed remnant.

By repenting from sin and consecrating themselves to God through Christ, they have submitted to God’s appointment of his Kingdom, thenceforth praying: “Thy kingdom come 1” In place of voting for a political party of sinful men and women of this world which fights against God’s kingdom they have made their choice once and for all time for a heavenly King, Jesus Christ. In his case, indeed, it is true, “the King can do no wrong.” We have given our unchangeable allegiance to this sinless Ruler and Governor, whose government will be without a single sin or oppression, but which will destroy all the evils of this world and bless the people with deliverance from their sins and from the penalty death and from sin’s originator the Devil.

There is such a thing as deadly sin; I do not mean he is to pray for that.—1 John5; 16, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For brethren who sin due to weakness but who repent, seek forgiveness, and ask our prayers that they may be helped to recover from such sin through divine mercy, we will pray. In answer to their repentance and our prayer through Jesus Christ, God will save such sinners from death. He will grant life in the case of all not sinning the sin to the second death, destruction. But in ancient Judah God told Jeremiah: “Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.” (Jer. 7: 16) For like reason we do not now join the religious clergy in praying for modern-day Babylon, whose sins reach to heaven, nor for religious Christendom.

In no great while it will be accomplished in vindication of God’s name and Word.

So, enter it and stay with it we </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that with contentment. We will serve and abide with our brethren in peace, yes, with his “other sheep”. We will not be drawn into strife and let ourselves be provoked to it. Away with all discontent and faultfinding! We will make the best of situations and give ourselves unselfishly to improving things for the sake of the work and the spiritual welfare of our fellow servants of God. We will enjoy to the full all our privileges as they come to us, responding to the call to action the way Christ Jesus our Leader did. We will preach.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Godless persons, who turn the mercy of our God into an excuse for immorality.—Jude 4&gt; A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Such evil-minded persons think they can go in for a season of enjoying the pleasures of sin whenever they like or feel the •urge. All they have to do is to go through a form of repentance and good behavior and ask God's forgiveness, taking advantage of his grace. Thus they can continue among His people, until the next time that they want to seek further indulgence in sin among the Lord’s people, if they can persuade others by false, impure reasoning to yield to their subtle advances. Such persons are guilty of “turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness”. They pervert the mercy of our God into immorality. Thev overlook the fact that, though the apostle told the consecrated believers, “Such were some of you,” he also added, “But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.” —1 Cor. 6:11. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus would not let the people make him king: “when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed.” (John 6:15) He waited upon his Father, Jehovah God, to make him a King at His own right hand in heaven. When he sat down at his Father’s right hand after he ascended to heaven, he expected to wait till the end of the “seven times” of the Gentiles. Those “seven times” equal 2,520 years. Since they began in the fall of 607 B.C., they end in the fall of A.D. 1914. Till that year Christ Jesus in heaven had to wait, and at that time he came into the kingdom and God sent forth the scepter of his sway out of heavenly Zion, to rule amid his enemies. By enthroning and crowning Jesus Christ as his Anointed King and Royal Consort, Jehovah God took his power and established his kingdom with Zion aS<sup>1</sup> his capital organization. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:8, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The faithful followers of Jesus Christ are the “children of light”. The children of this world deal with selfish foresight, for future advantage, with their own worldly generation. On the other hand, the children of light have to deal with the organization of light and must render account to the great Source of light and its channel, namely, Jehovah God their Father and Christ Jesus. God and Christ are pleased to have them do so. That is why Jesus recited the parable of the unjust steward. They should not show less wisdom than the children of this world do in their own way to their own generation. Children of light should be “wise as serpents”, but not harmful as these are. For using wisdom according to the light they have God will bless them through Jesus Christ. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 2:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan the Devil was permitted to wield the power to persecute and inflict death upon those who turned to God. For this reason many men and women, out of fear of such death at the Devil’s hands, were held in bondage to sin and the Devil. But now Jesus, by his sacrificial death, could nullify the death inflicted on men by the Devil, because Jesus could raise them from the dead. Because of this power to nullify the power of the Devil, Jesus Christ the promised Seed now frees many men and women, who, because of fearing the devilish power of death, were in slavery to him and sin all their past lifetime. These now enjoy the liberty of the children of God. Jehovah’s resurrecting of Jesus as an immortal spirit person made it possible for him to be King at God’s right hand to destroy the Devil and nullify his power. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore neglect no possibility. Use what you have according to the wisdom God gives you through his Word and his dealings with you. Do not turn over to others what privileges of service you may yourself render, resulting in a joy to yourself that you have never had before. Do not be foolish in this respect. If you have a territory in which to work and give a witness to the Kingdom, do not call in a pioneer publisher to work it if you can do it yourself. While the opportunity is there, grasp it and reap the fruitage of your own personal efforts. The rich opportunity will not endure always; so cultivate it. Look after the flock of the Lord’s “other sheep” in your territory by visiting them, inspecting their condition, taking an interest in them, and offering what help and comfort you can.—Prov. 27 : 23-27. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

Just because the rulers are taking the lead in following these spirits, it does not prove they are right spirits and are of God. Although the world rulers refuse to believe it, the influences mustering them out to battle and hurrying them on in their frantic course arc the spirits from demons. In this world crisis the rulers have yielded to the demons in opposition to God’s kingdom, and now the people as individuals must test the spirits abroad in the land to prove for themselves whether such spirits are of God or not. Then, regardless of who or how many choose to follow the demon spirits to destruction, those who love God and his kingdom of life must choose to follow only His spirit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Honest men love a clean organization. God’s purpose is to have now on earth a clean organization of his people, to which his Good Shepherd can assemble the great multitude of “other sheep”. Hence God orders those who bear the vessels of his temple for use in his service to be clean from all Babylonish or worldly contamination. (2 Cor. 6:17) Having sent his Judge to the temple for the cleansing of those worshiping at it, Jehovah God promises that his temple class shall be kept pure. The enemy forces shall never defile it again. However, droves of “other sheep” are now being gathered to the side of the remnant. They are joining these in ‘serving God day and night at his temple'. (Rev. 7:15) The Devil would like to infiltrate injurious, evil-designing individuals among them. So we dare not relax our guard.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the spirit-unfolded Word of God the remnant see prophetic pictures that disclose the “great multitude” of people of good-will who must now be gathered to the Good Shepherd’s fold. To those of good-will who answer the invitation to the water of life and consecrate themselves to do God’s will a share in the precious gospel ministry is assigned in the words: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” As the good-will persons obediently enter this gospel ministry, God imparts his spirit to give them strength and ability as his gospel ministers. Thus by the anointed remnant and their multitude of goodwill companions God’s spirit is saying “Come” to all who now thirst for life-giving waters. By persisting in this blessed ministry till the final end comes upon the world, they share with Christ Jesus in vindicating Jehovah’s name and word.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At his resurrection from the dead Christ Jesus was the first of God’s creatures to be clothed upon with immortality, deathlessness, so that now he is an immortal person. (Rev. 1:18) Because the incorruptible God the Father bestowed the prize of immortality in heaven first upon his only begotten Son, the apostle Paul stated that the Son of God “alone has immortality”. When Paul wrote, in the first century, none of Christ’s footstep followers that had fallen asleep in death had yet been resurrected to life in the spirit in heaven. Correctly, then, he wrote of Christ Jesus as being at that time the only one to have immortality. In now having the prize of immortality he was especially like his heavenly Father, who is “the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God”.—1:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Young.

It is high time to flee, not to the standard of the abomination of desolation, but to Jehovah’s glorious Signal, his King Christ Jesus, on the holy mountain of Zion, the Kingdom capital. To this the people must gather for security and deliverance from the divine wrath in this “day of Jehovah” which comes to its decisive final hour at the battle of Armageddon. Up, then, with Jehovah’s “Signal to the peoples”! Lift it up by songs of praise to the very height of conspicuousness! Be not afraid, for it is our God’s command that we lift it up.

Likewise with those who desire to become members of Christ’s royal priesthood by following in his steps till death. From the very beginning they must present a hearing ear to God’s message about the power of Christ’s shed blood to purify them from sin and to make them acceptable to God as his priests under the Chief Priest Jesus Christ. They must obey the words that Jesus spoke two years before he was delivered over tor the sacrificial death, saying: “Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.” (Luke 9:44) We must hold such sayings for our reference always. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

The divine prophecy said many things would be sealed shut to human knowledge until the present time of the end. It is now oui privilege to run to and fro at the right source of information and to share in the foretold increase of knowledge. It is most advisable for us to do so, for very sad consequences are certain to follow if we willfully refuse to keep up with advancing knowledge. Not only do we get behind and become backward, but serious sins are possible by us through ignorance, especially willful ignorance. People’s resistance to learning has led to enormous sin.

Therefore a glorious salvation awaits all those who now seek the Almighty God’s mercy and favor. No vacuum will be left by destroying the Devil’s organization that has wrought such wickedness.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The new covenant is more glorious than the Mosaic law covenant. So the privilege of being under the new covenant and serving its purposes by letting God’s light shine is a glory. Just because the faithful Christians were yet in earthen vessels God did not hold back from them this precious treasure of the ministry, but had mercy upon them in committing it to them. (2 Cor. 3:18; 4:1) Consequently, even if the remnant of today are in earthen vessels, they are not to be disrespected. Rather, because God has counted them worthy of his mercy and has glorified them with his ministry, we should fear to speak abusively of them. Jesus included them in his prayer to God when he said: “And the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">glory</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> which thou gavest me </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one.” (John 17: 22) If the remnant of called ones did not show belief in God instead of in men, he would not in his mercy show them such glory.—John 5 : 43, 44, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> IP </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Through persisting in godliness because of the joy, satisfaction and peace of mind it gives us, we learn contentment. Paul the apostle did. If his brethren of their own free will contributed materially to his support in missionary work out in the field or when he was in prison, he rejoiced at their show of love and assistance to God’s work. But if not, he was just as glad to serve God. Then he used what means and resources he found at hand, to make himself independent and self-sufficient. He did not let shortages impede the Lord’s work. In sending forth his followers Jesus told us we shall be treated just as he was. But why find fault at that? When we make our consecration to God we know it will not be a simple matter to carry out. We start out willing to endure trials, hardships, privations for his name’s sake. We must persist in doing so.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The typical passover sacrifice of the Israelites stopped being observed by the true Israel of God after Jesus came and finished his human sacrifice, A.D. 33. In parallel fashion, the memorial observance of Christ’s death finds its end after he comes and finishes up his death as carried out in his faithful anointed body-members. Till he comes in this sense, the remnant of his body-members will continue to take the emblematic bread and wine to proclaim Christ’s death, and they will continue to show this forth also in their daily course of action till their earthly life is done. The redeemed ones of mankind will not celebrate the Lord’s supper on earth during the thousandyear reign of Christ with his “bride”. Hence redeemed mankind’s abstaining from eating and drinking the memorial of Christ’s death begins in actuality with the “great multitude” of persons of good will of today, whom the Good Shepherd is now gathering.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The interruption of the tribulation in 1918 meant God would have to show further patience toward the “vessels of wrath”, the enemy nations. But it was well worth it That way he could show mercy on the “vessels of mercy”, namely, the remnant of the 144,000, that these might be “prepared unto glory”. This divine patience toward the “vessels of wrath” required a shortening of the days of tribulation upon this world, but this lull in the tribulation at its middle served for the salvation of the remnant who yet had to ‘make their calling and election sure’. After 1918 they have had the opportunity to be sealed in their forehead with the seal of the living God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Many rulers and judges object that young people are not qualified to preach the gospel. They think a person has to become old and hoary of head before being able to have wisdom and understanding. They forget to take into account the activities of the person in making their decision as to whether that person is an ordained minister or not. Christ Jesus was busy about his Father’s courts when at the age of twelve. Paul’s companion, Timothy, was a young man when he was called and anointed of the Lord to preach the gospel, and the churches as well as Timothy himself were advised not to despise his youth. The Bible, in fact, presents a long record of young persons that have stood for God and fought valiantly in their youth as well as in their older age for the preaching of the message of God’s Word. Jeremiah, Samuel, and others are examples of youth’s taking up the ministry as preachers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If we do not advance beyond the first principles of Christ, but childishly linger with the foundation truths, there is danger. Of what? A relapse into sin. A person who is a babe in knowledge is to that extent weak and can easily relapse. He has some responsibility, for, although a babe in knowledge of Christ, he has received at least some enlightenment. If he refuses to make progress, it denotes a certain willfulness on his part. He does not want to take on the responsibilities that come with greater light and fuller knowledge of God’s will and purpose. He is like a person that grows ont of childhood but wants to hold onto the playful, carefree irresponsibility of childhood, rebelling against undertaking the heavy responsibilities of manhood.

Giving </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ourselves</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to Him in service as a publisher of his kingdom is more valuable and more mighty in results than any mere money gift to him. Our possessing of his holy spirit or active force inside us is more important and powerful than possessing great mammonistic wealth. The possessing of the Kingdom truth from his Word, and the possessing of privileges of preaching which our having that truth offers to us, is more precious and puts greater responsibilities upon us than our possessing delusive riches.

Christ will express God’s forgiveness toward them by gradually healing them during his thousand-year reign and lifting them finally to an absolutely perfect human state, complete righteousness in the flesh. In this condition their choosing and standing true to God’s will for all time will gain for them justification to everlasting life in paradise restored to earth.

He did them in his Father's name as being his Father’s visible representative; and this was what male him and his Father one. (10:25,37,38) How two separate and distinct individuals, by colaboring together and having a common interest and one aim, become one, the apostle Paul illustrates, saying: “Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one.” Not one in person, but just one in God's work. Paul’s planting and Appollos’ watering and God’s giving the increase did not make them a trinity or “three in one” God. (1 Cor. 3: 5-8) Paul and Apollos were one because of peacefully colaboring together in God’s organization and service. Because God was the real One accomplishing the results through them, Paul spoke of the Corinthian church which he founded as being, nonetheless, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God's</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> husbandry, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> building: “We are God’s helpers, you are God’s tillage, God’s building.” —1 Cor. 3: 9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cath.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A tremendous world-wide witness concerning God’s kingdom is due, but it is a larger work than the Kingdom remnant on earth can themselves alone accomplish in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14. Hence the Good Shepherd gathers this “great multitude” of “other sheep” into the fold in company with the remnant in order to share with these in the wondrous privileges of the Kingdom witness. By sharing in the witness work the “great multitude” hail Jehovah God upon his throne of universal sovereignty and also his reigning King, the Lamb Jesus Christ. They cry out that their hope of salvation in this time of great tribulation lies in no man-made institution but solely in Jehovah God and his Lamb. By virtue of consecrating themselves to God and proclaiming the kingdom of his Lamb they are pictured as having a favorable standing before God’s throne and as serving him day and night in his temple, in unity with the spiritual remnant.—7:10-15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1&gt;/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus thus gives warning that a consecrated person might turn from the way of salvation. In proof that a believer who has been saved from his former condemned course of life in the world is not completely saved but may look hack and give up before the test is all over, Jesus further said: “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.” (Matt. 10:22) We must endure to the end of our earthly course in the way of salvation before we become finally saved, in the judgment of God. It is Satan the Deceiver that misleads Christians to think that once they have believed on the Lord Jesus and have been baptized and have stepped upon the pathway to life they are saved for all time without any possibility of losing eternal life by unfaithfulness. Jesus warns against this. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W h/l</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for the poor saints.—Rom. 15:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Note that this relief work was called a “ministry”. (Acts 12:25) It is part of the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses, for the Scriptures classify it as such. During the present postwar emergency they have shown a loving interest in the material needs of their brethren in various lauds. Paul calls this relief work a public service, even though it is not extended to the general public but is confined to Jehovah’s servants in Christ. (2 Cor. 8:4; 9:12,13) So, in this respect the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses is not to be blamed today. They may feel sure that this loving sharing of things with their fellow servants in need is one of the acts that Jehovah will not forget, for they have done this for his name’s sake, “in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.” We must keep it up to the end.—Hcb. 6: 10,11. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The wise person looks ahead. He desires to escape from destruction at Armageddon and to enjoy eternal life in the righteous new world. So he opens his ears wide to knowledge, that is, to information that comes from the true Source, Jehovah God, through Christ Jesus. He is prudent and wise because the knowledge he gets means protection and blessing now and life in the world to come. He knows Satan has deceived this old world, and hence he does not rebel against knowledge from God just because it shows him where he is wrong and reproves him. All this is necessary to guide him in the pathway to life. He does not despise his own life interests, but sincerely wants to live forever, and that to the glory of God. So he accepts with meekness what he hears, and stays wise. “The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. ... he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.” (15:31,32) He gets a better understanding of what it requires to gain everlasting life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In going after the “greater gifts”, such as prophesying, we have to work with what abilities or aptitudes we possess at first in their more or less crude, undeveloped state. We must seek to improve and perfect them according to the instructions of God’s Word. As we thus do, we will pray for the help of his spirit. What can be accomplished if we act thus in faith is illustrated by Noah. This God-fearing man was not a shipbuilder by trade. The Bible does not indicate so. The ark which he built must have been well built; it withstood the mighty forces incidental to that cataclysm, the flood. That ark was an exhibition of what the spirit of God can accomplish. Consequently the art of shipbuilding was a gift of the spirit to Noah. But he had to desire to build the ark because of what God told him, and he had to work at building it. He became equal to the task. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When we face the fact that God’s holy spirit is his invisible active force by which he can operate upon matter and mind and accomplish his will, then the above language becomes simple and comprehensible to us. This makes it reasonable for the Christian congregation, the “body of Christ” of 144,000 members, to be the temple of God. Being such a temple does not mean God personally or bodily dwells in the fleshly bodies of the members of this spiritual temple, for that would be destructive. If the mere sight of God would be destructive to a human creature, how, then, could a man have God occupy him bodily and live? (Ex. 33:20) God, “seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.” (Acts 17:24) Hence the way that the Most High God dwells in the Christian congregation as his temple is by means of his holy spirit, his active force. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those whom God saves from this world recognize Jehovah as God and Jesus Christ as the passover Lamb whose blood buys them out of this world. They confess, “Christ our passover is sacrified for us.” They have been thus saved from this world, but with the understanding that they should never return to it and its sinful bondage. Our being saved from this world at the beginning of our Christian career is no final proof that we shall share in the “common salvation” when the new world begins. Israel as a whole had a common salvation from Egypt and as a nation the Israelites finally entered into the Promised Land of milk and honey, but hundreds of thousands of individuals perished before entry into the Promised Land was made. They lacked faith. Hence we must all be on guard. We must contend for the faith once delivered. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

The Lord accepted him and sent him, and the grand book of the prophecy of Isaiah is one of the results. The like question comes to us today. Having the light of the truth and getting an appreciation of the opportunity of becoming a real minister and expanding our privileges of serving God, are we now just as ready as Isaiah to answer the question and say, “Here am I; send me”? If we are anxious to follow Christ’s steps, we will do so. If we do, we shall gain unspeakable blessings, and these without end. Confronted with the opportunity of such a ministry, let us not be anxious about food, clothing, shelter. Jesus did not make these the deciding factor in his life.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord Jesus Christ ... is our hope.—1 Tim. 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ on earth was not subject to vanity along with the rest of human creation, and he needed no deliverance from it. This was owing to the fact that he did not receive his life from Adam, but was the Son of God from heaven, and his heavenly life was transferred to the womb of a virgin descended from King David. Aa his life was from God, no condemnation, sinfulness, corruption and deathliness attached to Jesus by birth from the Jewish virgin, but he grew up to be a mature man in perfection. He was thus able to offer himself as a perfect sacrifice on God’s altar in behalf of mankind and thus become a true High Priest to Jehovah God, “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.” (Heb. 7:26) This vital fact makes it all the more necessary that we put our hope in him. Only by means of him can we be delivered from the vanity to which we are subject. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

We repudiate the United Nations as “mankind’s only hope” and regard it as a manifestation of the foretold “abomination of desolation”, which Christendom has caused to stand in the “holy place” as a manmade standard to substitute for Jehovah’s exalted Signal. (Matt. 24:15) We resolve that we will fearlessly and faithfully continue to lift up as the only hope Jehovah’s royal “Signal to the peoples” by singing its praises and by preaching, both publicly and from house to house, the rightful rule of His kingdom, thereby making it conspicuously known to all peoples of all nationalities that they too may gather to the great Signal and take their stand beside God’s kingdom of enduring peace and eternal life.

(Isa. 57:20.21) They do not hold to a steady course in righteousness, carrying out the organization instructions as Jehovah’s witnesses, but disobediently follow an irregular path. They are wandering stars, and have no part in fulfilling Daniel’s prophecy for the time of the end: “They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.” (Dan. 12: 3) For such “wandering stars” no bright-shining place has been reserved in the heavenly kingdom.

Peter says: “Add to your fa'th . . . patience [endurance] ; and to patience godliness.” (2 Pet. 1:5,6) If we endure, we shall live a life of devotion and service as Jesus did. “For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world.” (Titus 2:11,12, A.S.F.)

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The casting of Satan out of heaven by war in the spirit realm precedes the millennium. It hastens to a climax the “perilous times” that were predicted to come “in the last days”. Hence, more so since A.D. 1918 than before, we find Christendom filled with people who are “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God” and “having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof”. (2 Tim. 3: 1-5) This is not due to failure of true Christianity, for it was never meant to convert this present evil world. Yet It succeeds in producing the 144,000 faithful followers of Christ who prove worthy of reigning with him for a thousand years. Today Jehovah’s witnesses intensely preach “this gospel of the kingdom”, not in hope of world conversion, but just ‘‘for a witness unto all nations” before the final end comes upon this world.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses today, as ministers and preachers of the gospel, imitate Paul by working as necessary in order not to burden their Christian brethren with financial support of them as preachers. But necessity is laid upon them to be ministers and preachers. By reason of their consecration vow they have a relation to the Supreme Almighty One that involves duties higher than those duties springing from any human relations, so that they may not love father or mother, sou or daughter, or marriage partner more than God and Christ. As ministers they all take a leading part by going forth and spreading the gospel message in their community. Because there are more ministers than can all render appointed services in a company at one time, only some render these services at a particular time, just as with the Levites who, because of numbers, served in rotation at the temple.

It was not the mere rock, but his God, that made it safe for David. (1 Sam. 23 : 25-29) Hence David called Jehovah “his rock” and always sent up his prayer to Jehovah when danger appeared. He was never shamed with disappointment. Likewise it Has been with Jehovah’s witnesses in this twentieth century. His name has been upon them for their protection. Time and again in overwhelming numbers and with superior material powers their foes have been about ready to close in upon them to destroy them. But Jehovah bas stood as a craglike rock in between the foes and their objectives.

That kingdom is what the witnesses serve, and they look to Christ Jesus as their Commander and Leader, who is above all nations and political parties.

Such a course will be rewarded with everlasting abodes with heavenly Friends.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If the holy spirit was not an intelligent person, how could this seem good to it as well as to the conference of Christians? How could such impersonal spirit and those men decide the matter? In this way: Peter, Paul and Barnabas had done their works among Gentiles by the power of God’s spirit. To support their work, the disciple James under guidance of the holy spirit quoted Amos 9: 11, 12. Amos, whose prophecy was being fulfilled, had spoken and written as he was moved by God’s spirit. Accordingly, what was good and proper in the light of these operations of the holy spirit became plain, and the holy spirit thus helped in deciding the matter. The Christian conference did not decide the matter for itself, apart from what the spirit showed was God’s deciding will.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because Jehovah alone is the Supreme One and is the Almighty One, he is a God to his Son Jesus Christ. The Son therefore worships, adores and serves Jehovah God. In the forty days of temptation in the wilderness Satan the Devil came to Jesus and promised him all the kingdoms of this world and their glory if he would worship Satan. But Jesus told Satan to get hence and quoted to him Deuteronomy 6:13: “Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve.” (A.S.P.) Jesus thus made it crystal-clear to Satan the Devil that He was determined to keep on worshiping Jehovah as his God. Later on he told the Samaritan woman at the well that he worshiped Jehovah. He showed her the difference between himself and her people, the Samaritans, by saying: “Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.” (John 4:22) What Jesus worships is, not himself, but God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We are not the men to shrink back and be lost, but to have faith and so to win our souls.—Ueb. 10:39, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Having thus stated the need for faith and expressed our determination to display it, Paul then devotes chapter eleven of Hebrews to an account of feats of faith by men of ancient times who received witness of God that they pleased him for their faith. The apostle then says: “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.” (12: 1) So, then, no stopping for us, with danger that a relapse into sin will follow! But, laying aside all other weights to our proper progress, let us advance to maturity. Let us press on to perfection, showing patient endurance during the long run and trying to make the best speed possible toward the prize for unwavering faith, the eternal saving of our souls in the new world.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7, A.A.7'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For whom are Sodom and Gomorrah an example of warning? Peter answers: “Unto those that should live ungodly.” (2 Pet. 2:6, A.S.V.) Let those who sneak in and try to defile God’s holy organization beware. Those Sodomites were destroyed for burning with desire to defile the flesh of Jehovah’s holy angels. So these impious, ungodly persons are under doom to eternal destruction just as complete as if accomplished by fire and brimstone. May all of God’s sincere people take warning and not consider even momentarily the enticements of such doomed persons who sneak in with devilish cunning. In the hope of eternal salvation to be realized in the new world may we all resist such persons and so avoid their fate, by defending and contending earnestly for the faith once for all delivered to God’s saints.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Wisely we organized and equipped ourselves to praise Jehovah God and his Christ. We cannot now take our ease, leaning back on the past years of praising Jehovah. No; and neither do we fear what the enemies threaten and may attempt to do. We resolve to praise yet more and more the God who preserves and delivers us, yes, to add more praise to all the past years of praise to him; to praise him more than ever, and the longer we praise him to praise him all the more. No matter how long we live, we can never tell the number of his acts of deliverance of us individually and as an organization. We can never tell to the full all about his righteousness and the salvation that he performs for us and for all who turn from this world and give their faithful allegiance to Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. So we are decided that our mouths shall tell of his goodness all day long. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.—Zeph. 3:9, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking one language, the “pure language” of the truth, from one end of the earth to the other, Jehovah’s witnesses during 1948 piled up a mighty ‘heap of witness’ to the honor and glory of Jehovah's name. Again they have proved themselves to be a society of ministers. They have faithfully preached the good news of God’s kingdom to millions of persons and have shown what the ‘joy of all the people’ really is. They realize it pays to be different from this old world. The broad way down which the world is fast traveling leads to destruction; the new way, God's way, into which they have entered, leads to eternal life. They have learned of God’s kingdom and the blessings it holds, and it is their keen desire to share in these blessings and bring praise to the Lord God forever. All over the earth it is said by them: “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.”—Ps. 57: 9, A.S.P. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Note that comparison which Jesus makes between the unrighteous mammon and the true riches. True riches are not the material things of this world. They are the enduring riches, namely, the Kingdom truth and the privilege of serving as a pro-claimer and distributor of such truth that brings salvation to all receiving and living up to it. God’s service with these “true riches” is higher than that of using whatever material wealth we have. Of course, we must be faithful in using such earthly riches in God’s service, because, otherwise, he will not commit to us the superior riches of the truth and its continued service. God treats us in harmony with the rule that, if we are not faithful in what is of less or least importance, we will not display ourselves reliable in what is of much value and importance.—16 :10. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any cne intendeth after me to come, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and be following me.—Matt. 16:24, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ words prove that merely getting into the saved condition now by taking the preliminary steps is not sufficient. Besides that, we must follow him, that is, keep following him, and by doing so we must demonstrate that we have indeed left all, even close dear relatives, houses, lands, and other earthly riches and possessions, to keep on following him till the “world to come” is reached. (Luke 18:18-30) There must be no turning back. Peter ignorantly tried to get Jesus to turn back from the course which led to his death on a torture stake outside of Jerusalem. But Jesus refused to turn back. It would have been turning back to destruction. Jesus knew that to try to save his human life which he came to lay down would mean to lose his eternal future life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Peter says God begets the 144,000 again to a living hope &quot;by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead”. He also says they are begotten again of incorruptible seed, but “by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”. He says “this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you”. (1 Pet. 1: 3, 23,25) God the Father begets them again by his spirit, or active force, but this begetting must be in connection with his word which has been written down and which lives on and is preached till this day. For the 144,000 to get in intelligent touch with God they must get a knowledge of his Word of the gospel. This Word must be preached or presented to them, that they may know God’s purposes and the glorious heavenly opportunity that he sets before 144,000 from among mankind. For them to be begotten again to the heavenly hope God sends them his Word as well as his spirit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The situation in the world today invites us to preach, and blessed are we if we accept and act upon the invitation. It comes from countries, lands, states, counties, provinces and territories where there is a need for Kingdom publishers. But more than an invitation, a command comes to us from God: “Let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” (Isa. 43:9,10, A.S.E.) Aye, let the people hear, of all nations, kindreds, tribes, and tongues. Many, indeed, will refuse to hear. It is not to be expected otherwise, because neither did they hear Jesus the Son of God himself. (John 15:20) ft is not the general unresponsiveness of people that determines what we are to do, but the divine command. And in this end of the world, when Christendom is to be destroyed as Jerusalem was in Ezekiel's day, God’s command comes to us as it did to Ezekiel.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Though papyrus paper was at hand in Egypt, the writing upon stone or upon clay tablets was not at once broken off with Moses. The first writing that Jehovah God directly committed to him through an angel was on stone tablets, upon which the “finger of God” had inscribed the Ten Commandments. God’s finger wrote, not in cuneiform nor in hieroglyphics, but in the ancient proto-Hebraic alphabet. That was the living alphabet among the Israelites then; and the law given on Mount Sinai was to be read widely by the Israelites, particularly the Levites, and was to be understood by all Israel That written record was to continue on in the Hebrew alphabet, the characters of which would undergo some changes simplifying their outline, so as to be read in unbroken sequence by Hebrew and Christian scholars down to our own day. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 14,15, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s coming to judgment is here foretold. His chief holy one is the Messiah, Jesus Christ, to whom he has committed all judgment. Jehovah sends him as His judicial Messenger to the temple for judgment proceedings. Hence, as represented in this holy Judge, Jehovah comes and judges by him. Seeing we are in the time of this judgment and the day of execution of sentence draws near, Jehovah lets that ungodly class become manifest and engage in their ungodly works and speeches. In this way he can convict them of all such ungodly practices against his name, his kingdom, and his faithful witnesses. Do not be surprised at their appearance all about us. This “time of the end” is when iniquity was foretold to abound. We should take comfort that their end is foretold and is near. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus by his faithful course on earth unlocked the “mystery of godliness”. The things he taught by word and action w’ere &quot;healthful discourses”; they were teaching which accords with godliness. They lead to spiritual health which both profits us in this life and works for our profit in the life to come in the righteous new world. Christendom’s religious leaders, politicians and social guides agree with what Paul says all through his letter about practical godliness, but the facts show they do not teach and practice what he says. They are not spiritually healthy, but are mentally “diseased about questionings and word-battles”. A form of godliness has no power to save and give health. It does not hide Christendom’s corrupt, dying condition any more. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 0/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All kingdom appointments come from Jehovah, and it is he that made the great royal Signal to stand up on Mount Zion A.D. 1914. (Matt. 20:21-23) The cleansed and anointed remnant are the ones commanded to ‘lift up a signal to the peoples’. Inasmuch as Jehovah installed the Signal, Christ Jesus the King, upon Mount Zion, how can they lift up or raise the Signal? They can do it by exalting the King with praise and giving him prominence above all human rulers. This they have been doing since 1919, and are continuing to do it before all the peoples of all nationalities by preaching the good news of God’s kingdom as established in 1914 with Christ Jesus in the throne. By the gospel message they make Jehovah’s royal Signal conspicuous and call all peoples’ attention to it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.—Uph. 4:7, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing that the spirit and its manifestations are a free gift through Christ, none has a reason to complain because one manifestation of it is given to us and it differs from that given to others. Women have no reason to complain because of the manifestations given exclusively to the men. The God of creation measured the women better than they themselves can. He took their measure in Eden and created Eve accordingly, after Adam. The Christlike attitude is to be thankful for whatever manifestation of the spirit is conferred upon us as individuals. Then cultivate such gifts of the spirit as you have, making fullest use of them. What if others have manifestations you do not yet have or may never have? Such gifted ones are Christ’s present to the congregation. So try to get the most benefit from such gifted orethren. Enjoy their services. They were given for your profit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W S/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 71:18, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Old age and gray hairs do not cause Jehovah God to dismiss his faithful remnant from service or to forsake them. His prophecy on the last days of this world assures the Christian organization: “I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh [young and old] ; and . . . your old men shall dream dreams.” (Joel 2:28) In Bible times the old men were made ambassadors, so that to be an ambassador meant to be old. (2 Cor. 5: 20; Eph. 6:20) Quite so, God causes the remnant of the Christian organization in its old age to see fulfilled the dreams his prophets saw in ancient times, and also to be his ambassadors to deliver the final message of reconciliation at this end of the world. He has honored his anointed organization in its old age with serving as ambassadors of his established kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What we have belongs in reality to another, to the great Giver, Jehovah God. If we selfishly abuse or misuse what he entrusts through Christ to us as stewards now; that is, if we are untrustworthy and unfaithful in that which is another’s, how or why should he commit to us that which would be forever our own as his children in the righteous new world? Whom will God clothe upon with immortality in the resurrection, thus giving them life within themselves? Certainly not any members of his church if they have not proved trustworthy on earth in that which is God’s now, especially by right of purchasing us by the ransom sacrifice of his Son. Neither will he grant eternal life in the new world to his &quot;other sheep” of today if they do not prove faithful in the use of what he commits to them at this end of the world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The prophecies of Jehovah’s Word foretold the time coming when his ministers would be restored upon the earth and would serve him in all parts of the globe. In this restoration the spirit of the Lord God would perform its part. The anointed Jesus was Jehovah’s Chief Minister. He restored Jehovah God to his true and rightful place in the hearts and lives of his consecrated people. His followers, anointed with the same spirit from the day of Pentecost forward, became ministers of Jehovah because they became ministers of Christ Jesus and imitated him. During the centuries following the death of Christ’s apostles the ministry to Jehovah God was ignored by those who proclaimed themselves Christ’s followers. After those many centuries we have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> final fulfillment of the prophecy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If godliness is as profitable as that, then it is a means of gain, indeed. And it really is. By what other way could we gain forgivenesss of sin and the peace of mind this brings? Also the relationship with God as his children and servants, and the joy, knowledge, protection, care and provision, and the privileges of service, all due to godliness. These are all things of the present life. Do not think, though, that godliness does not profit us also physically now. It safeguards us against all the ills, excesses, expenses and dangers to which worldliness exposes us. Pursuing it, we avoid the way of sexual sins and all the physical disease and deterioration it means. As for physical exercise, with all its benefits to the body, think of all the motion in Jesus’ life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Contrary to the unifying work that God is carrying on among his people all over the earth, the mockers use various means to create divisions and to set up distinctions among His people. There is no true show of spirituality about them, but they are animal like other natural men. Although God has poured out his spirit upon his faithful remnant in the flesh, the mockers have not received that outpouring of spirit. (Joel 2:28,29) So there is no burning with zeal for God’s service about them. They assault us with abuse, they stir up strife and contention in companies to produce divisions and to distract us from God’s witness work. They do not gather with the Lord of the harvest, but scatter. This neither promotes love of God nor wins love from him. 17 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

If we would keep on following in his steps, we must likewise hold on to onr ministry to God. Particularly so now, at this end of the world, when Satan and his angels have been cast out of heaven. We must do so, for a special ministry is laid upon us now that Jesus Christ has been enthroned in the newborn kingdom of God. Now, in fulfillment of Daniel 12:3 we must be wise and shine as the brightness of the firmament, and must remain righteous and turn many others to righteousness and thus shine as stars. We must watch to avoid the coils of the dragon’s tail that has cast a “third part of the stars” down to this defiled earth. (Rev. 12:3,4) Let Christendom’s clergy go over to the ministry of the United Nations.

Since A.D. 1919 the anointed remnant have, with their comparatively few numbers, obeyed the command and lifted up the Signal to world-wide conspicuousness by preaching the Kingdom gospel. Multitudes from among the peoples of earth have seen the signal. They have come from tie ends of the earth and converged upon the King Christ Jesus, the Signal on Mount Zion, and have united in pledging him their allegiance as Jehovah’s anointed Commander to the peoples. W’ith self-denial and loving devotion to Jehovah’s kingdom, they unite in exalting his King and making him known to all peoples. We want the Signal of salvation to be beheld by all.

God is “from eternity to eternity”, and, by the way he counts time, he is now moving very speedily. His time of merciful patience, already exercised thirty years since 1918, will expire shortly. The day of the final outburst of divine wrath will be upon this world like a thief for suddenness, and it shall pass out forever. The new heavens and new earth will be here, and those who have appreciated God’s goodness and taken full advantage of his patience will enter into the enjoyment of that new world.

Is it not time to use wisdom and foresight, now that the old world is failing with all its transitory things and a new world without end is at the door?

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The spiritual remnant know they are in line for the Kingdom because they have fulfilled the preliminary requirements in God’s Word. It is not a matter of feeling. It is a matter of hope, a matter of God’s testimony to a person through His revealed Word. The remnant he has begotten by his spirit to be his spiritual children, and by his Word which he has revealed to them they know what their hope is. In harmony with their “living hope” of eternal life in the heavenly kingdom all prospects of life on earth under the Kingdom have faded from their minds and desires. They look forward confidently to Christ’s receiving them to a place with him on the throne by resurrecting them from the dead. (Titus 3:7; 2:13) They confidently confess their hope to all that ask of them a “reason of the hope that is in you”, but they do so with meekness and fear lest they should prove unfaithful and unworthy before the prize is won.—1 Pet. 3:15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Which of you convicteth me of sin?—John 8:46, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Knowing his own origin and his own perfect righteousness, Jesus said these words to his accusers. His disciples, instead of convicting him of sin in the least thing, testify to his unblemished perfection and innocence. Writing to those who had their sins removed through faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, Peter wrote: “Ye were redeemed . . . with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood of Christ: who did no sin.” (1 Pet. 1:18,19; 2:22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By reason of offering to God an acceptable sacrifice, his own perfect human life, Jesus Christ became God’s High Priest for the fallen human race estranged from God by sin. By virtue of his perfection he was a suitable High Priest for us: “Such a high priest we needed—godly, blameless, unstained, removed from sinful men.” (Heb. 7:26, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.A.T.)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hence, “Be you reconciled to God! For him who knew no sin, he made a sin-offering on our behalf.”—2 Cor. 5:20,21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/15 lie who searches the hearts, knows what is the mind of the spirit, because according to God it intercedes on behalf of saints.—Rom. 8: 27, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because we do not understand the prophecies and prophetic prayers, we do not know exactly how to express ourselves and the right thing for which to pray. If we understood the prophecies and the immediate purposes of God, we should pray for just that. But God knows his times and seasons, and he knows what is written down in his Word through his spirit. He knows how such written things apply to us and when. He knows what is the mind of the spirit, or what is the meaning of those spirit-inspired prophecies and prayers, and he lets these intercede for us. He accepts these as being what we should like to ask and pray for, and he accordingly fulfills them. Afterward he reveals to us by the power of his spirit how these prophecies have been fulfilled toward us, and we see that it is just what we should have asked for, had we known and understood. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The gospel which I was called to serve.—Eph. 3: 6,7, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The thing with which Paul carried on his public work was the gospel as founded on God’s written Word and as preached by Jesus Christ. Today, like Paul, Jehovah’s witnesses act separate from all the religious organizations of Jewry and Christendom. They are not ministers of the hundreds of confusing religions of Christendom. They arc in the same classification as Paul and other early disciples, namely, “ministers of the gospel.” It is with the gospel exclusively that they work. It is this gospel, and not the wisdom and religious ideas of men, that they teach privately and preach publicly. It is with this gospel that they are trained. They are instructed and built up in Christian faith with it. Acquaintance with this true gospel, then a dedication of themselves to make it known to others, is what makes them gospel ministers. They reject the religious traditions of Christendom as “old wives’ fables” and as profane.—1 Tim. 4: 7. IF </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.—Luke 11:28, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed, indeed, are the hearing ears today! Blessed, indeed, are our ears because of hearing what God has made possible to hear today, things not perceived by human ears since the beginning of the world, things that kings and righteous men of ancient time did not hear. It is because He has now set up in the heavens the promised government of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ our Ranscmer. When on earth the Son preached the Kingdom and let the people hear, and thus he unstopped many ears spiritually by putting the gospel into them. Mary’s virgin privilege of being the human mother of the Son of God born as a man was blessed, indeed. But Jesus named a blessedness surpassing that of the motherhood of the human Son of God. It is the blessedness of all whose cars hear the word of Jehovah God and who wisely keep it and preach it out to other ears—Luke 11:27,28. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pray in the holy spirit, and keep</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the love of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 20, 21, A.A.T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot build ourselves up in faith and keep in God’s love apart from prayer. We are told to pray “in the holy spirit”. This we do when we pray in harmony with the things which God grants us to see in his Word by the power of his spirit. Praying according to our flesh like natural men of this world will not get any answer from God. Jesus, when filled with God’s spirit, taught us how to pray. All of God’s Word written under inspiration of his spirit shows us what to ask in prayer. We will pray to be filled with his spirit, knowing he is more pleased to give this to his children than earthly parents to give good things to their children. His spirit is an effective protection against the influence of this world and the religious scoffers of the times. If we pray in the holy spirit our prayers will disclose a right heart condition. God loves that. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Never be soared for a second by your opponents; your fearlessness is a clear omen of ruin for them and of your own salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Phil. 1:28, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The more active we are about our heavenly Father’s work, the more we can expect the world to frown and oppose. But why let that dishearten us? There is no use in trying to get on the favorable side with this world. We cannot please it and our God at the same time. So we should never be fearful about speaking the truth, but should present it whether in season or out of season to ourselves. Jesus told us the world would not believe us. The thought of that should not cause us to slack our hand, but should nerve us to face an unappreciative world and to seek his “other sheep” and to appreciate all the more whatever of them we do find by preaching the Kingdom. Press on, then, in your individual expansion work, because if we all do so together, then there will be tremendous expansion results on the part of the organization as a whole. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ue . . . gave gifts unto men. For the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering.—Eph. 4: 8,12, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not begrudge others the measure of grace imparted to them. It is free. For that reason the outward expressions of the spirit are different with different individuals, according to God’s wisdom. But all the spirit’s operations through the various ones is for the common good. God appointed some to be apostles, some prophets, others evangelists, others spiritual shepherds, others teachers. Why all this variety? In order to train, coach and fit the entire congregation for its work of ministering God’s Word to others: yes, in order to build up the entire congregation in faith, nope and love. The very variety of gifts makes for the broadening and enrichment of the congregation, and for the proper balancing of its various members that it may not lack in any part but be able to meet any particular need or emergency. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons f—Jonah If: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God mercifully spared the Ninevites because of the faith in the message of doom and repentance. But Jonah was displeased that God continued to show them long-suffering and patience beyond the forty days. He wanted their instant destruction. But God’s mercy meant the salvation of more than 120,000 persons that could not “discern between their right hand and their left hand”. In the second century after Jonah Nineveh’s doom was pronounced and then executed by God; but the Ninevites of Jonah’s day were spared by God’s tender regard for their repentance. They pictured the “great multitude” of good-will of today. In Jehovah's sparing the Ninevites we can see a reason for his sparing Christendom and the rest of the nations since 1918. His wisdom so directs his actions that these qualities of mercy, patience, and forbearance toward the wicked are not misspent, but result in salvation of some. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The people of God’s mercy have become different and peculiar in the world’s eyes because they are determined to serve the only living and true God. They have become his chosen people. They have heralded forth his message of righteousness; and thousands of others have heard in these last days of the Devil’s organization and have sought refuge within God’s organization. They cannot sing the praises of the worldly nations, single or as United Nations, nor of any sect or religion, for all these are exposed by God’s Word as being idolatrous. They have the Lord’s Word and in it they find God’s instruction to praise him and thus gain eternal life. By faithfully preaching they save themselves as well as others who hear them. (1 Tim. 4:16) From God they receive his holy spirit and go forth speaking the truth, a “pure language”, as it were. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p><img src="yb1949_E_files/yb1949_E-3.png" alt="" style="width:141pt;height:43pt;">

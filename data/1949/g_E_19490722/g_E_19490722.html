<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>HOPE FOR STUMBLING JEWS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">TT IS no secret, World War II failed </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font14">to solve the Jewish problem. Of the 7,000,000 prewar European Jews, 5,600,000 were ruthlessly slaughtered, leaving 1,400,000 destitute, half-dead survivors. Haunting the minds of these unfortunate people are indelible memories of pillage, persecution, horrible ghettos and hideous gas-chambers, memories of friends and loved ones that were tortured to death. Many of Europe's Jews are displaced persons, poverty-stricken, ill-fed, ill-clothed and without a home of their<sup>1 </sup>own. Many have no peace of mind or contentment, are altogether without hope, and languish in fear of the future. Struggling to regain their feet, again and again they stumble and fall backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Seven thousand five hundred American Jews sacrificed their lives in the recent war in the belief that such persecution would be wiped off the earth and in its place freedom for all races would be established. To their dismay the half million Jewish war veterans returned to face the realities of the postwar world with all of the old racial hatreds and discriminations still here. Beneath the surface anti-Semitism still smolders and boils and here and there it breaks out in a nasty sore. Though the majority of American Jews are well off economically, yet they too are mentally distressed and stumble over many perplexing and apparently insoluble racial problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This darkness of despair, and gross blindness to a large extent, causes Jewry to grope along many roads seeking a way to escape from the dilemma. Some think that mutual friendship pacts with other races and religions will lead to better relations. Others champion the Zionist cause, believing that God has ordained them to set up a separate and independent Jewish state as the best means for protecting their lives and interests in this hostile polyglot world of a thousand “isms”. Many other nonreligious Jews shy away from this orthodox theory and follow after a god of their .own creation, the works of their own hands. Worshipfully they point to their education, culture, tradition and accomplishments, believing that if these are highly developed an idealistic, intellectual level will be formed upon which mutual understanding between them and other people can be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then, there are other Jews that condemn any such “visionary” approach to the problem. They boast of being “practical”. With a fever of revenge these push aside the law of neighborly love, <sup>f</sup>Do unto others as you would have others do unto you/ and practice the selfish modern creed, 'Do others before they do you/ The searchlight of honest investigation, however, will show that all these avenues of pursuit are nothing more than blind alleys full of obstructive and deceptive illusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many honest and sincere Jews, believing that the “good neighbor” policy is their best wall of protection, have joined forces with Catholics and Protestants in mutual friendship pacts, the “National Conference of Christians and Jews” being one such interfaith movement This, however, is one of the Devil’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">most</span><span class="font14"> deceptive and subtle schemes, for its brightly polished surface of ^accomplishments&quot;, its window-dressing of better understanding and co-operation between Christendom and Jewry, only blinds the credulous to its hidden achievements. Really the goody-goody lullaby </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">program</span><span class="font14"> of the interfaith movements makes honest criticism appear odious, and is therefore a powerful weapon to suppress the truth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Stumbling-Stones of Double-Talk</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Some people may revolt at the thought that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy sponsors and supports anti-Semitism. This is not surprising, since the Catholic population are only “children of the church” and have no part in the Church’s administrative affairs. Honest, churchgoing Catholics, totally ignorant of the Hierarchy’s duplicity and double-talk, may point to the fact that from time to time local organizations, like the Knights of Columbus in New York, break </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">into print </span><span class="font14">with wordy statements deploring the “bias against Jews&quot;. Has not Cardinal Spellman shpwn favors toward the Jews of New York, has not Archbishop McNicholas of Cincinnati given $1,000 to the Jewish Welfare Fund, and has not the Jesuit Father La Farge, associate editor of the magazine </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">America,</span><span class="font14"> said some nice words about the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And recently, did not Pius XII grant an audience to Rabbi Rosenblum of New York, a member of the executive board of the “Anti-Defamation League&quot;, when he called on the pope to use his office of authority to curb the rise of anti-Semitism? True, But to cite only these isolated instances as conclusive proof is'to close one’s eyes and ears to a multitude of testimony to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Keep in mind the vastness and complexity of the Hierarchy’s organization, how its political tentacles extend around the world, and how, for the sake of expediency, its crafty double-talking policies are made </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">to fit the</span><span class="font14"> local coriditoas of each nation and people. In America, where there is a high percentage of influential Jews, some members of the Hierarchy speak out against racial “bias”, but in a land like Egypt the voice of the Vatican sings a different song. The papal nuncio to Egypt has blasted forth that the Jews in Jerusalem desecrate Catholic churches and persecute Christian Arabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In Scotland, where there are very few Jew’s, this propaganda story was carried in glaring headlines by the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Glasgow Observer;</span><span class="font14"> but not so in America. In Spain, where the Hierarchy is in complete control, Jews are denounced as “enemies” of the church, and the Catechism used in the schools, edited by the Jesuit Maria de Arcos, speaks of “the accursed Jewish race”. For an official expression of what the Jesuits think of the Jews see </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Mind,</span><span class="font14"> Oct. 22, 1934. And St Francis Xavier, said to be “second only to Ignatius Loyola himself in the Jesuit calendar </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of saints”, prayed: “O </span><span class="font14">God, put me some place where there are no Jews or Moslems !&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Anyone who is loath to believe that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been and is the greatest f omen ter of anti-Semitism surely has a short memoiy. It is a short memory that has forgotten “Father” Coughlin’s attack on the Jews in America. Coughlin, a priest of the Hierarchy in good standing even to this year 1949, who, together with other Catholic priests like “Father” Edward Lodge Curran, led the rabble-rousing gang of “Christian Fronters”. Coughlin, whose own bishop backed him up in his hateful diatribes by declaring: “Father Coughlin is an outstanding priest, and his voice ... is the voice of God.&quot; Other fascistic organizations, like William Dudley Pelley’s “Silver Shirt Legion&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">and Gerald K. L. Smith's mobsters, served as anti-Semitic fronts for Catholic Action, These screamed forth that Jewi&amp;h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tonwonism are one</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">and the same thing. In London the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic &gt;&nbsp;Gazette</span><span class="font14"> ably supported the Jew-hating crusade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not only the &quot;’small fry” but also the more eminent members of the Hierarchy threw their weight of authority into the anti-Semitic campaign. “Rev.” A. J, Riley, librarian of St. John's Seminary in Massachusetts, in a pamphlet circulated under the imprimatur of Archbishop Richard J. Cushing, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The position of the Catholic Church with regard to the Jews has been and still is that the Jewish religion represents the direct </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">an</span><span class="font12">tithesis and contradiction of Catholicism. . . . She [the Church] has striven to preserve Catholics from such contact with Jews as might cause harm to the purity of the Catholic faith. , . . Full freedom to nonbelievers must be restricted when their activities interfere with Catholic worship or tend . . . to contaminate Catholic truth.—From a reprint in The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Countercurrent,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There you have it, a full explanation as io why the Hierarchy uses “swords of the Church” like Hitler to segregate Jews into ghettos and concentration camps, Jews so “restricted” do not “contact” Catholics or “contaminate” the whitewashed '‘purity” of Catholicism.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Axte </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Powers Gave Jews the</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ax</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">How any Jew could stumble into believing that an interfaith, bedfellow partnership with papal Rome means salvation from persecution is beyond comprehension. Such must W totally blind to historical events of recent years. Frits Thyssen, an avowed Roman Catholic, admits that he financed Catholic Hitler in order to establish a “Catholic Germany under a Catholic monarchy”. In other words, he tried to turn the clock back to the Dark Ages when the “Holy Roman Empire” was in the height of its infamy. It was Catholic Franz von Papen, a papal knight, who worked with Monsignor Kaas, leader of the German Center party, to bring Hitler into power and thus prepare the way for the Vatican concordat in 1933. Said von Papen: “The Third Reich is the first power which not only recognizes, but which puts into practice the high principles of the Papacy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was none other than Cardinal Pa-celli, now Pius XII, that signed that concordat with Hitler. It was Cardinal Innitzer that flew the Nazi swastika from the top of his cathedral in celebration of Hitler's taking over Austria. It was the Catholic priest named “Father” Staemp-fle that is reported to have been the real writer of Hitler’s “bible”, Mein </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kampf.</span><span class="font14"> It was the Catholic bishop of Muenster, Clemens von Gallen, that blessed German soldiers for their &quot;&quot;bravery-and stamina” in fighting against “Jewish-Bolshevist domination”. It was the Catholic bishops of all Germany that met each year at Fulda and adopted resolutions supporting Hitler's slaughterhouse rule. It was the Roman Catholic priest, Msgr. Joseph Tiso, as dictator of Slovakia that ordered the Jews of that country into the concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not only did the Vatican's blessing fall upon Hitler, but also his partners in brime carried on their wicked rules, including anti-Semitism, with the full blessing of the papal poyrers. Pope Pius XI lovingly spoke of that jackal Mussolini as “a man sent by Providence”. The pope blessed the butcher Franco and Spellman referred to him as a “fine Christian gentleman”. Likewise, Vichy France’s Petain, who persecuted the Jews of that country, was lauded by the pope as the “good marshal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Such an avalanche of incriminating evidence proves that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy openly worked as an intimate partner with the beastly totalitarian powers and therefore must share responsibility for the massacre of more tnan a,uuu<sub>:</sub>uuu Jews. jx is iuulc lor the Jesuits, with their pitchforks of propaganda, to try to dig the Vatican out from under this responsibility -by saying they aided and helped Jews secretly. To say the least, it is sadistic for the Hierarchy to claim they gave refuge to a handful of Jews while at the same time they refused to use their power to prevent millions of other Jews from being killed. All the Vatican had to do was impose the sanctions of excommunication against Hitler^ gang, most of whom were Catholics, and the butchering would have stopped instantly. But no, the cries of hundreds of honest Catholics who begged the pope to use such excommunication powers were completely ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">TFAere </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font14"> Popes </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Have Stood</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Tlje signing of the concordat with the Nazis, the same concordat that the Vatican on January 19 of this year insisted is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">still valid and must continue in force, </span><span class="font14">armed madman Hitler with the ecclesiastical power and authority he needed to carry on a rule of horror. Immediately he rekindled the anti-Semitic tires of persecution by issuing his infamous Nuremberg decrees. “Rekindled” is correct, for the Nuremberg edicts were exact replicas of the anti-Jew enactments of the popes of Rome who reigned during medieval times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Persecution of the Jews as we know it dates back to the days of Constantine, when Roman Catholicism was first made the state religfon. Says the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The accession of [so-called] Christianity to the throne of the Caesars by the conversion of Constantine, opens a new era in the history of the Jews. The equality of rights to which the pagan emperors had admitted them was gradually restricted by the head of the Christian State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The restrictions of the various popes caused the Jews to be separated socially from other people, required them to wear special badges and dunce hats of identification, forbade them to marry Gentiles, prevented them from holding public offices or offices of trust, and denied them many of the basic human rights. The fact that the popes, theoretically at least, condemned acts of violence against the Jews carries little weight in the argument, since the Hierarchy, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">in theory,</span><span class="font14"> also condemned the violence of the Inquisition. In practice they never hesitated to use violence either in the Inquisition or against the Jews when their aims could not be accomnliKhed otherwise. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pope Benedict VHI had a number of Jews put to death on hearsay that they had blasphemed Jesus. Hostilities against the. Jews reached extremes under the reign of Innocent III (11981216), the most powerful medieval pope, who declared: “As Cain was a wanderer and an outcast ... so the Jews . . . . . . although they are hot to be killed, must always be dispersed as wanderers upon the face of the earth?' Again this pope said concerning, the Jews: &quot;They are to us as dangerous as the insect in the apple, as the serpent in the breast”; they “gnaw like the rat” and “sting like the.serpent”. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 added oil to the fire with renewed prohibitions, and Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241) reminded Jews they “should never forget their yoke of perpetual slavery”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thereafter clerical anti-Semitism reached such a murderous state that Pope Innocent IV (1243-1254) was forced to call his pack of Catholic Ac-tionistg off the throats of the Jews in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews. ... In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. &gt;. . . They oppress the Jews by starvation, imprisonment, and by tortures and sufferings; they affiict them with all kinds of punishments, and sometimes even</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">condemn them to death, so that the Jews, although living under Christian princes, are in a worse plight than were their ancestors in the land of the Pharaohs.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But, adds this encyclopedia, “the protestations of the Boman pontiffs do not seem to have been much heeded in the Christian states generally?' In fact, later popes reissued the edicts of Innocent III and added some new ones of their own. Pope Boniface VIII openly insulted the Jews. Pope Eugenius IV, in 1442, laid down the law: “We decree and order that from now on, and for all time,. Christians shall not eat or drink with Jews, nor admit them to feasts, nor cohabit with them, nor bathe with them.&quot; Moreover, he declared that Jews must live in ghettos, and in courts “against them Christians may testify, but the testimony of Jews against Christians in no case is of any worths Pope Julius III (1553) condemned sacred Jewish books to the flames. Pope Paul IV (1555), after taxing the synagogues and forbidding Jews to carry on any commercial activity, graciously declared: “Jews may only engage in the work of street-sweepers and rag-pickers.&quot; Typical of Hitler's order was this one by Pius V in 1569:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We order that each and every Jew of both sexes in Our Temporal Dominions, and in all the cities, lands, places and .baronies subject to them, shall depart completely out of the confines thereof/ . . . [If refusing to go, then] they shall be despoiled of all their goods <sup>1 </sup>and , . . shall become bondsmen of the Roman Church, and shall be subjected to perpetual servitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And many other anti-Semitic crimes could be recalled from the ecclesiastical pages of history: the persecutions under Popes Gregory XIII, Pius VI, Pius IX and Leo XIII; the murdering of Jews over moldy bread (see </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> October 8,1947); the terrible suffering due to the false accusation that Jews used the blood of “Christians&quot; at Passover time. How many Jews lost their lives by the </span><span class="font11">JULY </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">hands of demonized Catholic Crusaders from the eleventh to the fourteenth century will never be known. If Jews in general today knew these facts—they are set forth in their own </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Jewish Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font14"> volume 10—many of them would not ‘ stumble into the awkward position of making an interfaith alliance with a leopard-like organization which boasts that it “never changes&quot; its spots,—Jeremiah 13:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Hope in Zionism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Turning away from the interfaith movements, can Jews confidently place their hope and trust in the Zionist movement! Will the new Jewish state of Israel permanently solve the age-old problems of these persecuted people! Will the establishing of a homeland for world Jewry bring them peace and contentment, happiness and freedom from fear? Many Jews and non-Jews think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The searchlight of truth, however, when turned on the Zionist doctrine shows up many pitfalls and roadblocks in this way of thinking. The basis of the theory is that God ordained by the mouth of His prophets that some day Jews after the flesh would he re-established as a nation within the borders of David's ancient kingdom. Such prophecies as Jeremiah 32: 37 and Isaiah 40:1, 2 are cited as proof. Orthodox Jews, and some religions of Christendom that hold to such a theory, fail to realize that these prophecies were fulfilled in miniature in 537 B.C. when natural Jews returned from Babylonian captivity and rebuilt the temple at Jerusalem. The greater and complete fulfillment is found in “spiritual Israel&quot;.—Galatians 6:16; 3: 7,29;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">, True, a Jewish national state now exists, but not because Jehovah God established it BHtain withdrew from Palestine and purely political forces moved into play to bring about the new government. International politics and high finance pressured the great powers of the world to recognize the government that has been chosen by popular</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">vote. The same type of mudslinging electioneering was carried on by selfish political parties—Orthodox, Socialist, Communist, Nationalist, Radical and Terrorist—the same as in other nations of this world. Jehovah God was in none of their thoughts. They reject God that He should rule over them, even as they did 3,000 years ago. They want to be like the other nations of this world.—1 Samuel 8:7,19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As a nation the new Jewish state spurns God's laws and commandments and precepts, and &quot;The teachings of Aaron David Gordon, a Jewish philosopher, [and his] proposed road to human happiness has been largely adopted in Jewish Palestine”. (From the Jewish paper, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Day)</span><span class="font14"> A constitution is now being drawn up, and, if Prof. Saul Lieberman, of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, is correct, Israel's civil laws will be largely based on the Talmud traditions that make void God's laws. (Matthew 15:3) Nowhere, not at any turn, does this new state seek to be ruled over by God's Theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Why, then, would God bless such a nation T Did He not east them off, as a nation, because of their stubbornness and rebellion against Him? Where is there any evidence that they have repented or reformed? Are they not under Satan the Devil's rule as a part of this old wicked world of religion, politics and commerce, and hence doomed to destruction at Armageddon, as are other nations? As a nation did they not reject God's anointed king, Christ Jesus, that He should not rule over them? and do they not still reject Christ as Messiah?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Chrlrf, a Stone of Stumbling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">There are two reasons why the Jewish population will not accept Christ as the Messiah. First of all, Christendom, by its rank hypocrisy and wicked crimes committed' under the assumed name of Christ, has blinded views to the real character of Christ. You persecuted Jews, get this straight: Christendom is no more Christian than the Devi] himself; hence, the terrible things suffered have not </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">come the hands of real Chris</span><span class="font14">tians. In fact, true Christians have suffered similar treatment as the Jews at the hands of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The second reason why Jewry in general has stumbled over Christ is that they have foolishly followed their blind rabbinical leaders, who have done everything possible that would discredit Jesus in the eyes of the people. Remember that Jesus was a Jew, His apostles and disciples were Jews, and honest-hearted Jews by the thousands, who refused to be led astray by the Talmudic fables, gladly listened to Christ and accepted Him as the promised Messiah. The fact that the scribes and Pharisees stumbled over Christ was one of the sure signs to the faith-keeping, Scripture-believing Jews that Jesus was Messiah, that mighty &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;, Shiloh, unto whom the gathering of people of goodwill of all nations would be. Had not the psalmist foretold: “The stone which the builders rejected is become the chief corner-stone. From </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the Lord is this come </span><span class="font14">to pass, it is marvellous in our eyes”? —Psalm 118:22, 23, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser;</span><span class="font14"> Acts 4:11, 12; Genesis 49: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Stone of Stumbling, Christ Jesus, which the world builders reject has become the precious headstone of Jehovah God's Theocratic Government. Therefore it is high </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">time for</span><span class="font14"> individual freedom-loving Jews who have faith in the Almighty God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to flee the snare of the interfaith movement, avoid the totalitarian myth of Communism, side-step the road-block of Zionism and whole-heartedly accept Christ Jesus as God's anointed and reigning King. This is the Jews' only hope of salvation and deliverance from the impending destruction. It is the only hope for any of mankind, regardless of race, color or religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Some revealing facts about the conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of the war trials</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font14">THE wake of World War II many </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font14">nationals of Germany and Japan were brought to trial. Charges were mistreating, torturing, starving and killing Allied prisoners of war in violation of the rules of w’arfare laid down by the Geneva Convention. The accused were divided into two groups, the major offenders, like Goering and Hess of Germany and Tojo and his 23 associate leaders of Japan, and the minor offenders, consisting of a vastly larger group of enlisted men and officers who actually came in contact with the Allied prisoners. It was decided that these men should be tried according to democratic ideals of justice rather than by the harsh procedure of court-martial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Judicial procedure as practiced *in democratic lands, and which is Based on English law, eliminates ancient methods of getting confessions by torture or imprisonment of accused men until they will ^talk’k Under the democratic system a man is considered innocent until proved guilty in a fair trial conducted by an impartial and unbiased judge. The accused is provided with a defense lawyer for his protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For a judge to be impartial, he must be trained so he is able to sift out facts from hearsay, gossip, opinions, guesses, untruths and statements calculated to inflame the mind by passion rather than persuade it by facts. The judge must be free and independent to render a decision without fear of consequences. All personal interest in the case must .be detached, and his position, promotion, salary and citizenship must not depend on</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tiqTakiiaHo/iday</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">his judgments. The prosecutor never wins or loses a case; though it is common practice to say he does. His duty is to see that all available evidence of a criminal nature is impartially tendered to the court. A fair trial according to democratic procedure requires that a defense lawyer shall have full opportunity to cross-examine all evidence to aid the court in determining the truthfulness of the charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The court must be concerned in determining whether the defendant is guilty, what his motive was, and whether he was of sound mind. Then, in imposing a just sentence the judge must be concerned as to whether the sentence is for punishment, or is an expression of vengeance, or vindictive retribution, or whether it is for curing and reforming the offender, or is merely for the protection of the public from further assaults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Theoretically, the war crimes trials were supposed to follow this model or pattern in order to make sure that only men guilty of crime would be punished. It is not always so, in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Judges VFhoWtf </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unqualified</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The trials in Germany and Japan were held before commissions made up of military officers: colonels, majors and captains, the great majority of whom had no training in law or in the art of sifting out evidence of fact from surmise, opinion, gossip, hearsay or passioninducing statements. These men were all subject to promotion and an increase in salary if .they did their jobs in a manner that pleased their superior officers. In theory, a captain was free to disagree with a colonel; in practice he could not. Army custom requires that subordinate officers must obey their superiors and not express opinions in disagreement with their orders. Captains and majors, knowing full well that an entry could easily be made on their personnel record cards to the effect that their 'services on court-martial work is unsatisfactory^ found it “unhealthy” to hand down decisions that were in disagreement with those of a colonel that was presiding as president of the war trial commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Court procedure at these trials was a far cry, from that used at home. Defense attorneys were greatly hampered in their work. For instance, in America the accuser is forced to fcaee the accused, and his testimony is subject to cross-examination by defense counsel. But such procedure was out of the question in these war trials, for mistreated Allied prisoners were back in Australia, England, Canada and the United States; some on farms, some in hospitals. So, to avoid the impossible task of having these men return to Germany and Japan and stand before their enemies and accuse them openly, written statements or affidavits were substituted. Oftentimes these affidavits contained a percentage of truth and a percentage of patriotic hatred, resentment and vindictive statements intended to make former prison keepers take the rap, When twenty or thirty of such written statements were thrown against an accused man at one of these trials it was impossible for him to refute it, since he could not cross-examine the writers.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Trial by Inquisition</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Probably the most tragic part of this whole business has been the &quot;self confessions” that some investigators obtained by using physical and mental brutality, &quot;third degree” methods, ruses and similar stratagem. The use of these tactics in the Malmedy war trials in Germany, in which 137 Nazi defendants were fnistreated, have shocked all decent people. Senator Langer charged that &quot;confessions” were gotten by &quot;beating and brutal kickings, knocking out teeth and breaking jaws, mock trials, solitary confinement, torture with burning splinters, posturing as priests, very limited ratioiis, spiritual deprivations and false promises of acquittal”. One &quot;standard operating procedure” consisted of &quot;kneeing” or kicking the accused in the &quot;groin”, a parlor description of an atrocious act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is reported that ''mock trials” were held in which the accused were brought before investigators dressed in army uniforms. Thus disguised, they sat behind a black table upon which was a crucifix and two candles that furnished the only </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font14"> in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font14"> room. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">In this eerie </span><span class="font14">atmosphere the victim was given a sham trial with false witnesses, and was sentenced to be shot at dawn. Then, when the first streaks of daylight appeared someone called on the victim with a prepared &quot;confession”, telling him if he signed he would at least escape with his life. Using another ruse, an investigator dressed as a Catholic priest entered the cell of the accused, heard his confession, and then upon leaving suggested that he sign whatever the authorities gave him even if it was not the truth. &quot;It will get your freedom,” and &quot;I can give you absolution now in advance,” he was told by the bogus priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Hundreds of years were spent in developing the Magna Carta, Habeas Corpus and various Acts in an effort to curb just such &quot;star chamber” proceedings as this. And though the present democratic procedure frequently seems technical, cumbersome, long-winded and sometimes unjust in that it 'permits criminals to escape for lack of judicial </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">proof, it is the </span><span class="font14">best safeguard against the jailing and execution of innocent men. Yet, the way the colonels and army officers at these war trials let down the bars and admitted all manner of improper &quot;evidence” reveals their scorn for judicial justice and their sublime pride in their own personal integrity. Remarked Senator J. R. McCarthy: &quot;How can we condemn the Russians for the way they conduct trials, if we do just as bad, or worse?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The sentences handed down by these commissions were also out of line with what is considered proper in civil courts. The army has its own methods of punishing those it finds guilty. If an offense actually warrants five years' imprisonment, it is increased to seven, ten or fifteen years in these war trials. This way the army holds a club over the head of the prisoner to force him to exercise good behavior. After a couple of years in prison the sentence can be ci^t down, or at the conclusion of a few more years the prisoner can be set free with all appearance of clemency. Occasionally there are exceptions, and the accused are acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Judicial Justice in Name Only</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">To answer the question, Are alleged war criminals given fair trials according to democratic concepts? those that are familiar with the proceedings cannot give an unqualified answer in the affirmative. The judges are neither neutral, independent, unbiased nor detached from an interest in the eases. They would need to be citizens of neutral countries to qualify as impartial. When sitting on a commission with a colonel, no captain or major gives full rein to his own independent judgment with his salary increase at stake, with a promising future and his promotion at stake. The admission as evidence of gossip, hearsay and opinion, untested by cross-examination, loads the judge's mind against the accused. Safeguards against railroading an innocent man off to prison are missing, Also the sentencing procedure does not allow these military judges to assay fair penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Moreover, members of these military commissions are not unbiased. How could they be, after reading home papers during the war, which, as standard propaganda practice, required omission of the enemy’s viewpoint? As one American captain, after hearing sentence pronounced on a Japanese captain for not restraining his men from mistreating Allied prisoners, declared: &quot;Well, I'm glad it isn't the other way around. I had 105 men under me in Okinawa. After what we had been told* what cruelty the Japs had used on our men, I sure wouldn’t want to be responsible for what they did after they were loosed on the enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Once found guilty, the sentence imposed does not altogether reflect the democratic spirit of justice. This is ber cause the individual criminal and his degree of guilt is lost in the overriding determination to issue a national punishment on the defeated enemy. Judges, therefore, are not free to consider whether the sentence imposed will cure, reform or correct the one guilty of committing war crimes. At the best the sentence is punishment; to the extent that it is the minimum it is retribution; to the extent that it exceeds the minimum it is vengeance; to the extent that it is based on exaggerated or inflammatory evidence, it is vindictiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Man has little reason to boast of his justice, for since the days when Nimrod stepped beyond his own borders in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font14">campaign of conquest, all nations have been embroiled in wars and counterwars. And who is able to ferret out and bring to justice the real culprits, the callous beasts, the monsters and morons who are guilty of fomenting such wars? Or who is able to punish with just retribution the multitudes whose hands are stained with participation in crimes of war of one sort or another? How forcefully recent events—years of bloodspilling wars followed by years of guiltsearching trials—show that no government today is able to administer justice or cope with the staggering problems of this wicked world! Surely, what lovers of peace and righteousness and justice need and desire is Jehovah God's Kingdom government that will put an end to all wars, abolish boundary - feuds forever, prohibit war crimes, and establish a just and righteous rule!—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Contributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">(feathered Incubator Operators</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;L Long before man thought of artificially incubating hen eggs certain birds were successfully in the business for themselves. Taking advantage of the environment at hand, or building a suitable oven if Accessary, these birds use various means other than their body heat to hatch their eggs. Their devices are sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but always efficient, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;f Probably the best-known bird that uses “artificial” heat to hatch its eggs is the African ostrich. Scooping out a shallow saucer in the sand for its eggs, it lets the radiant sunbeams &quot;do the work. The Egyptian plover, also using the sun's heat, knows that too much of a good thing is too bad. So, after depositing her eggs in the warm sands, lest they become hard-boiled in the shells, she sits on them during the heat of the day to shield them from the torrid sun. Out in the East Indies on the Moluccas </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">islands there is</span><span class="font11"> a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">bird that buries its eggs</span><span class="font11"> 14 to 24 inches deep in the sand along the beaches. At such a depth a uniform temperature is maintained night and day (the heat is furnished by the sun), and seepage from the ocean provides proper moisture.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490722_files/g_E_19490722-3.png" alt="" style="width:285pt;height:170pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">&lt;f The whole family of fowls </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Hfeffapeditdae), </span><span class="font11">similar in classification to domestic chickens, but not being nest-sitters, use some very interesting methods to incubate their eggs. These birds include many species of brush turkeys found in Australia and many of the islands northward to the Philippines, One species that lives in the Celebes buries its eggs in the vicinity of hot springs, while another goes up the slopes of an active volcano and leaves its eggs in a crevice where they can soak up warmth from the boiling mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Other members of this interesting family build an incubator capable of generating its own heat. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Zei&amp;oa oceilaia</span><span class="font11"> of southern Australia </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">digs a </span><span class="font11">hole in the sandy soil and fills it with leaves, trde bark, twigs and other vegetable matter’that will ferment. This compost pit develops quite a temperature during the months that follow; in fact, a temperature too hot for the eggs. The bird knows this, and waits till it cools down to about 85-95° Fahrenheit. Then it digs a hole into the center, lays its eggs, covers them, over with a layer of sand, and then fills up the hole with a mixture of sand and compost. But this is not all: on dear, hot days these birds call around in the mornings and open up the nest down to the last layer of sand that covers the eggs. Then, at the close of the day they carefully cover up the nest so that the soaked up heat will not escape. Smart birds I &lt;[ Many species of these incubator builders construct a mound of compost material rather than dig a pit, which seems just as efficient. A curious thing about the Australian brush turkey, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aledora lathami,</span><span class="font11"> is the fact that when it looks like rain the cock opens up the top of the mound, and then when the rain is over he closes up the hole. This </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">might seem like a foolish thing to do until it is </span><span class="font11">explained that the moisture thus taken in increases the rate of fermentation, and consequently raises the temperature, while at the same time provides an ideal humidity beneficial in hatching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In such an incubator as. that built by the Aus* tralian brush turkey the temperature is bo low, 85-90’ F,, it is a wonder the eggs hatch at all. Hen eggs would not. But God in His infinite wisdom took care of this in designing the eggs. The brush turkey’s eggs are very large, weigh as much- as 17 percent of the mother’s weight, and have yolks that are something like 200 percent the size of the albumen. The yolks of hen eggs are only 62 percent as much as the albumen; hence the brush turkey’s eggs generate much more heat in themselves than chicken eggs, and consequently need less exterior heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A strange and unsolved mystery is the fact that this group of birds all deposit their qggs in a vertical position with the large end up. Somehow, it is believed, this feature has something to do with the hatchability of the eggs in these bird-made incubators.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">O</span><span class="font14">NE hundred million dollars is a lot of money to lose. Yet conservative estimates say American homes suffer this much loss each year due to the ravaging effects of moths. Others figure' the annual damage amounts closer to $200,000,000, with thousands of tons of costly material totally ruined. “In one year,&quot; says George Stimpson in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Information Roundupj</span><span class="font14"> “the larvae of one female [moth] can easily destroy as much wool as a dozen sheep can produce.&quot; Here then is a deadly enemy of the family budget, one that every household should he on guard against. Know your enemy, her characteristics and habits of life, and also know your weapons, their power and effectiveness; then plan your strategy, win the njoth battle, and save yourself a lot of money besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">. There are some 6,000 species of moths in the United States but very few of these come uninvited into people's homes and there carry on their work of destruction. Clothes moths are not natives of North America. They' emigrated from the old country as stowaways in the trunks of early settlers. Both they and their relatives, the carpet and fur moths, there being several species of each, are lepidoptera belonging to the family named </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Tineidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the wing in the adult stage they are all very harmless. Banish the thought! They would not think of nibbling even on the most tender fiber of wool. Why, their mouths and stomachs cannot handle such mundane material. Many moths in the reproductive stage of adulthood have sufficient reserve energy to carry on without eating, while those , that do take nourishment sip only on dainty nectars of delicate flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Instead of food, Mrs. Moth has another matter on^her mind, that of finding a suitable nest in which to lay her eggs. “Suitable” means a warm woolly place in the folds of a sweater, the pleats of a skirt, the cuffs of trouser legs, or between the cushions on the sofa. It must be a dark hideaway too, for moths 'love darkness better than light because their deeds are evil'.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Babies the Villains</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">The Mrs. is a busy gal. She has a lot of work to do and her short life-span is only a few days, at the most' only a few weeks. When finished ovipositing she has laid from 100 to 300 eggs in 2-dozen batches. Still no harm done. But woe unto the garment the day the eggs hatch! In normal summer temperatures this takes from 4 to 8 days, but in a cool place they may remain dormant for three years. Emerging from their shells, the tiny imps, about 1/16 of an inch long, begin gnawing on anything and everything they come in contact with that is made of wool, fur, feathers or horsehair. No vegetarians, they by-pass all cottons and linens, and synthetic fibers such as rayon and nylon. If undisturbed the larvae caterpillars may spend the summer eating the seat out of hubby’s winter suit, growing fat, and reaching a length of 1/4 to 3/8 inch. No wonder moths have been called “the best-fed household pest!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At some time during this larvae stage the worms or caterpillars build themselves cocoons, the design of which identifies each species. Some fashion themselves a movable cylindrical casef a sort of house-ear in which they live, as they eat their way </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">through your wardrobe. </span><span class="font14">The carpet moth spins a cobwebbing retreat of silky threads among the piling of the rug. Other species of clothes moths cannot be bothered with cocoons until they have finished their job of destruction and are ready to sleep through their change in life, the pupa stage in the life cycle. This chrysalis </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font14"> pupa stage varies in length from 8 days to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font14"> weeks, and it is during this time that wings develop as well as the reproductive organism of adulthood. Emerging as. full-fledged moths, the cycle has been complete which may have taken five years, although it can then last but 55 days. In the wanner climates, and in steam-heated buildings, the cycle seems to' go on continuously, but in seasonally cold climates it is interrupted from time to time with dormant periods of inactivity.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Planning the Battle Strategy</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Only the wool-eating worms do the damage, it is true, but if the eggs are killed or the industrious mother is prevented from ovipositing, then the cycle is broken, the brats never hatch and the battle is won. There are many weapons, as well as tactical maneuvers, that can be employed both offensively and defensively in this battle. Circumstances should dictate which are to be used. Frequent washing and dry cleaning are two of the best moth-proofing treatments there are, and if used there is no neces-sity of storing the garments away during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The disconcerting fact that bachelors seldom have moths proves an important point in moth-control, for bachelors don’t pack away their clothes in good housewifely fashion. They just keep them cleaned and hanging in the closet. Deplorable as it seems to the tidy feminine mind, it’s a lot safer than storing them away under the usual partly &quot;moth-proof” conditions.—JZouse </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">and Garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, winter clothing, used only a few months in the year, should be stored away in the spring. Sweaters, scarfs, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">underwear, blankets and such like can he </span><span class="font14">washed; suits, overcoats and ponwash-ables can be dry-cleaned. If impractical to either wash or dry-clean, then brisk brushing, especially under collars, inside pockets, etc., and exposure to the sun for several days is very effective. Articles that are subject to fading should not be placed in the direct sunrays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When storing woolens for the summer one of the most important things to watch, a point so often overlooked, is to make sure that every hole and crack is absolutely tight. This holds true whether cedar chests, trunks, boxes, garment bags or closets are used. Ordinary wrapping paper is plenty good, provided it is sealed tight with sticker tape. If the convenience of an extra closet is available it too should be sealed throughout lest moths find their way in through the wall partitions. Gummed paper or, better yet, scotch masking tape should be placed around the outside of the door. Remember that all this effort may be wasted if one faiJs </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">to. cover the keyhole. Another </span><span class="font14">very good suggestion for storing blankets is the use of new galvanized ash cans, making sure there are no small holes around the bottom seam. The lid too must be made airtight with strips of masking tape.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Gas and Gun Warfare</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">If there are no eggs in the garments when they are put away, and it is impossible for moths to get to the articles, it is not necessary to spray or use moth balls. However, as a double precaution, just in case a moth does get in, it is good to use some sort of repellent. So many women think that Mrs. Moth finds the faint smell of moth balls as objectionable as they do; but this is not true. Moths have no sense of smell, hence the hanging up of a few moth balls in an open closet or half-open trunk is no more protection than a superstitious rabbit foot or horseshoe or an African fetish. Moth balls made of naphthalene, or the newer and more powerful paradichlorobenzene flakes (<sup>ff</sup>para” for short), evaporate as a gas, and it is this gas that kills the eggs and larvae provided it is concentrated enough. Therefore, for every 75 or 100 cubic feet of storage space there should be at least one pound of these chemicals present</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Guns, that is, spray guns, can be loaded up with potent ammunition and fired at prospective maternity wards of baby moths. There is an attachment for modern vacuum cleaners that lays down a heavy fog of moth-repelling spray, and it is very useful in spraying large areas, such as rugs and draperies. Some sprays are supposed to be effective for a year. Be careful to give an even coverage, for any areas you miss the moths will find. It is, of course, a waste of material to use these sprays on any materials the moths do not attack. Antique sprays of forty &lt;&nbsp;years ago, consisting of a weak solution <sub>r</sub>of corrosive sublimate and strychnine in alcohol, have been replaced with DDT and other synthetic chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Furniture with mohair upholstery is a vulnerable target for the air attacks of fuzzy-winged moths. And since these articles of the household cannot be put up in &quot;moth balls” they should be cleaned frequently with the vacuum. Also needletype spray outfits are available that will put a fumigant deep in the cushions. Moths go for the felt used in grand pianos, a place you probably overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For furs, the best mothproofing is offered by the cold storage vaults that are now available in all the larger cities. Moth eggs will not hatch and larvae become inactive in cold storage. During the war a “shock” treatment was announced for ridding furs of moths. By placing the furs in a quick-freeze unit and suddenly chilling them to subzero temperatures and then restoring them to normal temperatures the larvae are killed. Then repeating the process catches any eggs that withstood the first cold-snap shock</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mothproofing</span><span class="font14"> Woof</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One of the latest ideas in the battle against moths is to treat blankets, furniture coverings, rugs and carpets and drapery materials with moth-repellent chemicals in the process of their manufacture. The effectiveness of such treatments is said to withstand five washings and cleanings and last five years. Men's suits are now advertised, the fabrics of which have been “Boconized”. This means the wool in them has been treated with a substance that chemically and permanently unites with the molecules in the fiber and prevents moths from even sampling the goods. Anyone can now get this chemical, made by the Bo-con Chemical Company, of New York city, and spray or dip one's suits and sweaters and other wmolens in it. It is guaranteed to withstand 25 dry cleanings or 5 water washings, and is said not to damage the wool. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The havoc wrought by the offspring of moths is not a menace peculiar to modern times. Sixteen centuries before Christ poor sore-eaten Job likened himself to “a garment that is moth eaten”. As for winning the battle against moths, there is no better advice than that given by Christ Jesus when He said: <sup>c</sup>‘Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, ana where thieves break through and stepl: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.”—Job 13:28; Matthew 6:19,20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">C </span><span class="font11">But on April 10, 1949, Columbia Uni ver- ft sity announced that long-term experiments with 0 bacteria provided further proof that change in ft environment does not influence heredity in any ft way. The scientists showed that certain micro- ft organisms that appeared to have changed as a ft result of changed environment actually had in- ft herited those changes before alteration of en- ft vironment.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Palomar “Eye” Still Nearsighted</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The San Diego Union, March 2, 1949, gave the following interesting report on Palomares telescope: “The 200-ineh telescope on Palomar mountain, taking a look twice as far as man ever saw before, has made its first great discovery. There is no outer edge to the universe of stars even that far away, the distance light can travel in a billion years [it travels more than 186,000 miles in one second]. Even out there, the telescope found families of stars like our own Milky Way. The discovery is the first step to great things. It may mean a restudying of Einstein’s theory that the universe is limited. Possibly there aren’t any limits. This new, far-distant part of the universe was photographed February 1 by Dr.^Edwin Hubble, the astronomer. Hubble, in lining up the new telescope for further polishing of its mirror, turned the instrument northward and upward to shoot for distance. In this north region, the stars of the Milky Way are less numerous. It is good for looking into the complete unknown. He got some pictures, pin-point size. They were announced at the California Institute of Technology as nebulae, a billion light-years distant. . . . The 200-inch telescope probably can see farther than the billion years of its first longdistance shots.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">C. </span><span class="font11">But Palomar’a “giant eye” is still too nearsighted to see the expansiveness of Jehovah God’s universe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Blips” are the light spots on the viewing screen of radar equipment, caused by the reflection of radar waves that warn the operator of objects located. Heretofore unexplained blips appearing on the screen are now said to be flying insects in the lower atmosphere that reflect the radar waves in the same way that they are sent .back as echoes from a plane. A powerful searchlight beam pierced night blackness while observers at different levels of a, 200-foot tower counted insects and radar operators counted blips. The sighting of insects and blips coincided often enough to justify the explanation, and insects fit the descriptions of the heretofore mysterious, blips. They are small, move at speeds comparable to wind velocity, with and against the wind, are present both day and night, and there are more in warm weather than in cold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">P</span><span class="font14">IRT ROYAL was once a pirate's paradise, but today it rests on the bottom of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The latter half of the seventeenth century unveiled West Indian history in dramatic episodes with Jamaica in a leading role. From the clutches of Spain the island went, by conquest, into British possession. During this period Port Royal, then the capital of Jamaica, became chief hideout for buccaneers, those rollicking rascals who roved the high seas in those days. Jamaica's governor welcomed these wild ayid lawless characters; for his was a constant dread of attacks by revengeful Spaniards, of whom the buccaneers were avowed enemies. Now, the foul spirit of plundering, being thus invoked by authority, soon manifested itself in more daring evil emissaries—the marauding, murderous pirates!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With such piratical protection, coupled with the bristling command of old Fort Charles, Port Royal stuck out like England's glittering saber brandished in the face of the Spanish colonial kingdom. Near by, did lie the golden principality of Panama, and the lustrous treasurelands of the South Sea. A glorious lure for Port Royal’s brood of pirates indeed! And never did they spurn such lure, as the run of succeeding years well revealed. Port Royal soon became their treasure chest,</span></p>

But her crest was yet to be set a-glitter by many another of her barbarous brood. Roberts, Avery, Kidd, “Blackboard,” and all the evil crew of the “Jolly Rogers”, were the most notorious scoundrels and cutthroats of her pirate wolf-packs. For years, like falcons, they swooped down through the Spanish Main, robbed the Spanish treasure ships, played havoc with shipping that flowed through the Florida Channel, and for merriment, with their rich spoils, crowded into Port Royal, a speedy refuge and a quick market for their pillage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But the most notorious of them all, and the one whose name, until this day, haunts the remains of Port Royal, was Sir Henry Morgan, the one-time lieutenant governor of Jamaica, and conqueror of Panama, That arch fiend was the son of a poor Welsh farmer, and, as a youth, was sold into slavery in Barbados. During his days as a slave he was inspired with enthusiasm for his later adventures on the high seas. Numerous were his evil exploits, but his bloody plunder of Panama in 1670 was his crown for rapine. Away from that massacre he sailed, with six hundred persons, men, women, children and slaves, and with 175 muleloads of silver, gold and precious stones. After this staggering success, then Morgan swindled his crew of its share of the booty, left them marooned on a desert island, and, with the entire spoil of £70,000 and other treasures, put out to sea. And for where! His unholy haven, Port Boyal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When pirates thus returned </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">to Port </span><span class="font14">Royal (and seldom did they return without much booty) the old capital, with added evils to increase its constant state of wickedness, became a devil’s den of sword-clanging and hilarity. The riches accumulated over long years by the Spaniards were squandered in taverns and brothel houses in a few nights,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>A Den of Debauchery</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">A continual carnival of craze and corruption, Port Royal’s sins were many: drinking, swearing, gambling, whoring, killing—“indeed the place has been one of the lewdest in the Christian World, a sink of filthiness, and a mere </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Sodom” </span><span class="font14">&quot;The state was barbaric but splendid. No form of vice was wanting, no indulgence too extravagant for its lawless population/’ Revealing one source of the town’s notoriety, Sir Thomas Modyford, friend of Morgan, the pirate and governor of Jamaica at that time, wrote: “The Spaniards wondered much at the sickness of our people, until </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">they knew the </span><span class="font14">strength of their drinks, but then they wondered more that they were not all dead/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pregnant with riches and evils, so in her glory, flourished this pompous em-Sorium of her day. With two thousand ouses (and many of them as good as any in London at that time) she reached her pinnacle of splendor. Ab in wealth she increased, so in wickedness she flourished. This was Port Royal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Sweltering midday, Tuesday, June 7, 1692. Came a gentle shudder of the earth. Another, more marked than the first! From the distance—a horrible sound like Nature moaning in anguish, From sea, from sky or from land, no om could tell. Horror-breeding, terrorizing, soul-devouring rumbles! A jarring quake with Earth writhing in wild convulsions ! A colossal gape of Earth’s ravenous jaws! A desperate struggle with lashing great billows, &gt;&nbsp;and with a thunderous </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">crash!—down went Port Royal!</span><span class="font14"> Screams of anguish, shrieks of horror, men, multitudes, buildings, and wharves loaded with merchandise, in a moment swallowed down by Tragedy with one aqueous gulp! Like an ill-fated galleon, ladened with bounteous booty, and with all her crew of scoundrels, down, down, down she plunged to the bottom of the seal</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So perished presumptuous Port Royal. It was as though divine judgment had been wrathfully expressed against her. As <sup>&lt;f</sup>being a dreadful warning to a sleepy world : or God’s heavy judgment showed on a sinful people, as a forerunrier of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">terrible</span><span class="font14"> day of the Lord” was Fort Royal’s sudden destruction in the sight of Captain Crocket. (1692)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of the violent panic that gripped her in her last hysteric moment, few of her despairing population were left to telL Memorially, of that few was one Lewis Galdy. On his tombstone at a place not far </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">from Port Royal, an inscription tells </span><span class="font14">us: “Here lies Lewis Galdy, Esquire , . . who was born in Montpelier in France, but left that country for his religion and to settle in this island; where he was swallowed up in the great earthquake of 1692; and, by the Providence of God, was by another shock' thrown into the sea and miraculously saved by swimming until a boat took him up/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Legend has it that on clear days with calm weather the decayed ruins of old Port Royal may yet be seen cradled deep beneath the sea. About fifty yards from shore floats an old buoy called “Church Buoy”. At this spot, in 1859, a diver is said to have gone down and successfully identified the remains of old Fort James.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In later years, settlers rebuilt Port Royal, But Fate seems to have pronounced a lingering curse upon the unfortunate town, for in 1703 she encountered a disastrous fire,, and was again overwhelmed with destruction. Years after, like a haunt of the old buccaneer days, trom the ashes oi disaster rose a third Port Royal, only to haye the fatal year of 1722 blast her with a tremendous hurricane, devastating her irreparably. Only a “ghost-town” remained. Finally, in 1744, persistent Fate, in alliance with the dreadful, tumultuous, demolishing combine of earthquake and hurricane, besieged the ill-fated town, and laid her to the sands,</span></p>

The very sight hears all the aspects of a sequestered graveyard. And like a melancholy epitaph expressing worlds of irony and tragedy in one word, lingers faintly the ill-fated name, Port Royal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Old Port Royal, Jamaica's lost capital so long by sea and time obscured—is she really lost? Almost beyond a probability, her environs, her busy marts, her noisome dens, her rowdy taverns, and her lusty brothels, which once reeked with gross abominations are lost, gone forever! But as for her vanished population, what? What can be said of them? Vile though the majority of them were, yet perhaps some few may benefit by the promise of Jehovah's sure Word; “And the sea gave up the dead which were in it . . * and they were judged every man according to their [future] works.”—Rev, 20:13,</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Would you recover that immense wealth? Without enumerating the many hazards that would surely obstruct you in such an adventure, wise you would be to let perish all thoughts of it. “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness ; and all these [needful] things shall be added unto you” is the advice of Jesus Christ for all conscientious treasure seekers of these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because the majority of men have spurned such advice, today the stormy sea of mankind is overridden by modern pirates—pirates in the persons of big financial speculators, greedy grafters, black marketeers, and bureaucratic buccaneers who employ even the “Ship of State” in their ruthless raids upon the poor and oppressed masses. Their ill-gotten booty, indeed, in staggering sums, lies heaped. But for tragedy “they have heaped treasure together for the last days”! More and more by the thousands, even from the ranks of the common man, petty pirates, chancing the winds of fortune, are launching out upon the overcrowded sea of speculation* All are impelled by the same cutthroat spirit of “get what you can regardless of how you get it, and forget the other fellow”. A spirit of piracy for sure!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All such treasure seekers are certain to meet with disaster.

Wooded hills and mountains encircle her boundaries, and on the giant peaks the snow continues to glitter throughout the summer months. Gentle rivulets and sparkling brooks murmur unceasingly; swiftly-flowing str earns,, their turbulent waters foaming at the weirs, churn their several ways through fruitful pastures, between mountains and hills.. Waterfalls thunder from the mountain heights, plunging into the ravines to pour their waters into the transparent lakes reflecting as in a mirror the fleeting clouds and surrounding scenery to the delight of ^.we-struck admirers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Near the formerly inaccessible Macocha precipice are situated the far-reaching Katharine caves which lead to the Punkwa Stalagmite caves, named after the mysterious Punkwa river. In the northern part of the Karst region, peculiar blind and half-blind valleys are grouped together through which streams are flowing, disappearing from sight, however, within the great rocks, to plunge into the dark bowels of the earth beneath as they reach the hole-riddled limestone strata. It is not precisely known the course the waters follow, but they converge and reach the Macocha Plain in one powerful river appearing from the darksome unseen not Jar from the Macocha under the name of “Punkwa”. Scientists have succeeded in investigating only a part of the subterranean course of the Punkwa during the past 150 years.</span></p>

Just beside the staircase there hangs a 4-meter-long stalactite in the form of a cone, which, owing to its position, has been designated “The Watchman”. In the middle of the Dome stands a gigantic alabasterwhite column formed from a frozen waterfall with numerous, frozen streams-leading out to join the “Chancellery” not far distant. Above this brown-tinted colossus, which constitutes the largest stalactitic column of the Moravian nether world, stand a number of yellow and -white pipe-like stalactites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Following a gloomy concreted canal, we find ourselves in a spacious hall, called “The Reichenbach Dome''. To reach the far side of this room we must mount steps and ascend the pathway which takes us 27 meters higher in altitude. Great windows have been made in the roof, and numerous chimneys, and the floor is strewn with massive rocks. Away up here the dissimilarity and wild character of this Dome is clearly discernible. The stalagmite gangway varying from 10 to 18 meters in width through which we walk is characterized by a steep incline formed from piles of fallen rocks. The ceaseless dropping of these calcareous deposits has softened the hard lines and decorated these massive rocks as with a garment. Suspending from the roof are thousands of little stalactites on which the drops of water sparkle and glisten in the light like diamonds, giving us the impression of having entered an unreal “fairyland&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the “Rear Dome&quot; that we now enter, a deep stillness, peace and serenity reigns. Over a surface of about 80 square meters [about 96 square yards] a host of the most varied stalagmite columns are distributed. In the middle a huge snow-white caldron stands with smaller companions at respectful distances attended by a host of little basin-like pools. To the south of this group stands a deformed figure with a ludicrous cap on his head, and a nose extending a meter long on which he is balancing a bowl Above is a high chimney with a long echo. Too numerous indeed are the statues and columns here to describe and we pass on from this peaceful scene through a well-constructed tunnel leading to the “Balcony Caves&quot;, first discovered in 1808, in order to reach the base of the Macocha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At first we have the impression that before us lies a wide, green meadow, and only as we take in our bearings more carefully do we recognize that we</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">are facing a steep, green moss-covered wall of rock, and that we have come into a deep hoDow through this underground route. Two green lakes call forth our admiration, the upper one being 20 meters in depth and the under one over 30 meters. From the one above flows a narrow stream, the Punkwa, fresh and spritely, bounding over the stones into the lake below, which in turn loses its waters within an abrupt cliff as they follow their underground course. Here trout revel in their freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A bridge has been constructed over the Punkwa, and from the other side of the hollow we can see a deep, yawning cavern, the overhanging wall conveying the impression of the form of wide-open jaws, and which, owing to its wild awesome character, has been named “The Jaws of Hell&quot;. As we, look above us to the little top bridge, the depths we have reached are fully brought home to us. It resembles a, bv^d's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aivd the</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">of the people above are mere dots. The panorama before us is magnificent, breath-taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Boating on the Punkwa</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A shorter and more comfortable underground pathway leads us up again to the earth's surface, and we can continue our wanderings. We now take the boat and follow the Punkwa's underground course, viewing other caves and grottoes as we pass. The water becomes ever deeper as we continue our passage from Dome to Dome. Sunken</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">water, revealing fallen rocks in all grotesque forms. The walls on each side ire smooth, with little shallow pools hollowed out by the perpetual dripping of water. We travel about 300 meters within earth’s interior and on the return journey we leave our boat at an underground landing stage on this great lake and make our way to the Masaryk caves.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Masaryk Caves</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Our guide leads us along a passage through stalactite curtaihs to a domelike opening whore formerly a veritable beaver cemetery was found; a whole colony, large and small, lost their lives as the unusually swollen waters of the tide overwhelmed them. A wider but low,-er passage leads us now into the “Masaryk Dome”. Deeply stirred with amazement we stand silently on the threshold, which is not surprising, for the snowwhite magnificence is overwhelming in its beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At the very entrance our gaze falls upon a mighty, alabaster-white column down which water ceaselessly ripples. But this is not. the center of our wonder and enthusiasm. Bather the thousands of stalactites, both white and crystalclear pipes and cylinders, hanging from the roof like icicles, up to meters long, and we wonder within ourselves how it is possible for a tiny stalactite 4 millimeters thick and 2 inches long to bear a “carrot” weighing 50-60 pounds. And why do some, not all, of these cylinders suddenly leave their normally perpendicular hanging position and branch put horizontally or slope upward, so forming hooks or little branches like trees? It would be impossible to describe^ in detail these magnificent works of the Creator, and so we will content ourselves with the assertion of scientists that this alabaster-white stalactite cave is one of the most beautiful in the world. But are .all known to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In this alpine region of Moravia there are still other caves and grottoes. All have their special beauties, their bizarre and grotesque figures. However, we must leave all this glory and visit also the Slovakian Karst or alpine region.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Marvels of Demanova Caves</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Not far from Liptavsky Sv, MikuUs the Demanovd caves are to be found. Only in 1924 were the public first admitted to this one-kilometer-long (a little over half a mile) “Freedom's Dome”. This is comprised of several domes and v’e will endeavor to describe some of tiiem, There are certain differences in these caves as compared with the Punk-wa caves, they being two-storied. Across terraces we walk over an underground canyon and cast many a glance down upon the green waters of the River Lucan -ka, which falls into the depths on reaching the first dome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A peculiarity of this grotto is the pearl pisolites, pea-size globular concretions formed either by the crystal aragonite mass around a grain of sand, or by the polishing of stalactite crumbs by constant movement in the eddying streamlets. A second peculiarity is the petrified moss, which carpets the floor of the Dome in certain places; it came about by the drying out of shallow water basins or hollows in which fine plantlife more like sea-fungus sprang up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the beautiful ^Main Gallery”, “Jewel Chamber” and “Chapel”, we see long, delicate white haulms or stems at the end of which are little ear-like heads in yellow, orange or purple-red. The sinter crystalline walls are usually dark red, explained in the rich iron content, carried by the water from the upper strata of earth. The fine hanging haulms, their colors varying from golden yellow to orange and dark purple-red in the “Chapel”, convey the impression of the rays of the setting sun streaming through painted glass windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the “Dome of the Dead” we see the form of a gigantic petrified skull. The “Great Dome” is outstanding for its purple-red vases. In the “Jurkovicgang” is a most beautiful frozen waterfall. Beyond the Great Dome is the delightful blue-green “Tesnohlidek Lake”, with its banks covered with fine crystalline frost which it is forbidden to touch. Drops of water fall lightly to the lake below, the size of the drops varying the modulation of the tones. Thus the waterdrops have conversed with the lake throughout the ages.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Underground Gardens</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Many little golden and silver water basins are here, and standing beside one is a delicate statue of a woman. Little drops of water fall from her dainty fingers one by one into a purple-red vase. Upon the surface of another “lake” with a golden ground swim purple-red water lilies; the lakeside and the flowers are bordered with silver fringes. How beautiful it all is! Around us we see fine stalagmite blossoms, hushes and figures, and suspended from the roof, in the form of cymbals is a group of dark-red stalactites. When tapping on the side of these cymbals with a piece of broken stalactite a mighty voice tones forth and vibrates as a long echo, as though a bell had been set into motion. And all this magnificence is set as a gem in a background of a snow-bedecked stalagmite pine forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In “Kulihrasek Dome” are streams and hollows with pealike crystalline pisolites, some adhering tightly, others in constant movement and made smooth in the bubbling waters, until they glisten like pearls. Here we find also a 2-meter-high, rose-colored stalagmite group, with the petrified roots of a tree near by and the waters gushing forth in a spray. And here the river has gained momentum and roars like waters descending the rapids. This mysterious underground world has also its so-called “Dante's Inferno” and in the depths of this gruesome abyss roar rushing waters. And here is the largest stalactite column of central Europe, measuring 15 meters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the vicinity, in the “Dobsina” region there is another ice cavern in the Duca mountain. A wooden staircase leads into the^ cool “Small Hall” where our attention is attracted to the first ice formations. These are like tombs, and there is a miniature of the High Tatra mountains and a frozen waterfall. The electric light enables the visitor to see the grotto in all its loveliness, and the electric cables heavy with frost give the appearance of ropes of pearls.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Skating Rink</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">In the “Great Hall” situated deeper in the earth's interior we see a still further wonder. This hall, which measures about 130 yards long, 66 yards wide and 12 yards high, has a floor of pure ice. In summer skating competitions have been held here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In descending to the floor below we can see that the entire room above is formed by a tremendous glacier with a weight of many thousands of tons. From here it is also quite discernible how the ice increased, and from this antechamber we can convince ourselves that the whole floor of this hail is composed of ice and not of ice-covered rock. Our way leads us farther to a deep abyss. After wandering an hour through this underground ice cavern we once again reach the earth's surface. And while we ponder'on many questions that arise in our minds about these underground marvels, we are glad to bask in the warm rays of the sun and warm our chilled members.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A Righteous Standing with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">RIGHTEOUS standing with God means to be free of the condemnation of sin in His sight. Why, you say, we are all born in sin inherited from our first parent Adam, and it is impossible to have such a standing with God! But there you are wrong. It is now possible 'to have such a standing, no, not by our own efforts at righteousness, but by faith in the righteous Son of God whom Jehovah God provided as a sacrifice for our sins. This righteous standing means justification, and a message telling of such would be good news, would it not* Yes, and such is the good news that God preached to Abraham centuries ago.—Galatians 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">gospel</span><span class="font14"> means </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">good news,</span><span class="font14"> and it is received by man from God. It is good news, indeed, to learn that God has provided for man a way to be free from the condemnation and to live under divine approval, and the gospel reveals how man can obtain eternal life. But who has brought this good news or gospel to the knowledge of man? Certainly no worldly scientist or evolutionist nor any heathen religionist such as Socrates, Plato or Pythagoras. The Bible answers: “God . . . hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and’ grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.” —2 Timothy 1: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By these inspired words it is seen that Christ Jesus has brought life and immortality to light by His first appearing nineteen centuries ago, and this proves that the popular religious doctrine about the inherent immortality of the human soul is an. absolute falsehood and is of Satan the Devil. Almighty God preached beforehand this good news to Abraham, but Abraham could not understand how salvation would come; but, regardless of this, he had complete faith in the truthfulness of God's promise and God counted him' righteous because<sup>1</sup> of his faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Before Abraham’s resurrection and return to life God's kingdom by Jesus Christ must be fully organized and in power. The coming of Jesus Christ in power and glory marks the beginning of His reign as King, according to Matthew 25:31. When He ascended to heaven He received command from God His Father to wait until God’s due time for Jesus to begin His reign. (Psalm 110:1; Hebrews 10:12,13) In the meantime God proceeds to select from among human creatures those to be associated with Jesus Christ in His heavenly kingdom. That selection God does according to fixed rules governing persons who have faith in Christ. As respects this selection of persons of faith Jesus said: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, eometh unto me.” —John 6: 44, 45.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Those who receive knowledge from God </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">awakei </span><span class="font14">and about Jesus Christ the Redeemer, and who then exercise faith, are the ones whom God draws to Jesus Christ. Such persons are seeking the way to life. Jesus' disciples were the first to conform to the rules leading people to be members of the heavenly kingdom, and since then all persons who have become true followers of Jesus Christ were required to take the same course. To all such Jesus says: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24) Within the meaning of Jesus’ words, to deny oneself is to put one's own selfish will aside and agree to do God's will. That step is what we are accustomed to call nowadays “consecration&quot;, This is what it is reported that Jesus did: “Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:7,8; Hebrews 10:5-9) After a person makes a consecration to God, then he must “take up his cross” and follow Christ Jesus. The term “cross” here does not mean a literal tree or stake of wood. As here used, it means the. reproaches that fell first upon Jehovah God and then upon Jesus and that must also fall upon all who follow-in Jesus' steps. Concerning such course it is written: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should *follow his steps.”—1 Peter 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By inheritance from Adam all men are sinners and hence imperfect. So how could God accept a born sinner as a follower of Jesus Christ, the Perfect One! By reason of that sinner's faith in God and in Christ as his Redeemer and by his agreeing to do God's will concerning the divine purpose and so devoting himself to God. Then God counts that person as a righteous man, as perfect or righteous in the flesh. That it is by reason of the person’s faith and obedience that he is counted righteous by God, we read: “Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God ; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God ” (Romans 3:22-24 and 5:1,2) Thefee words prove beyond any question of doubt that the benefit of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus results only to those who exercise faith in God and in Jesus and who render themselves in obedience to God's will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is God's will that all those who are made members of the heavenly Kingdom shall die as human creatures and be resurrected from death and live in the spirit with Christ in heaven. Such faithful ones die as the Lord Jesus died, sacrifieially. For being faithful to death, they have a part in His kind of resurrection, which is the chief resurrection. Those ^elected to become prospective members of the Kingdom are therefore now justified because of their faith, and thus they are the first ones to receive the blessing spoken of to Abraham, namely, 'Tn thee shall all the natipns be blessed.” They are then counted as dead with Jesus Christ and are begotten to life as spirit creatures. “Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.” (Romans 6:3-8) And where they will live with Him is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The remainder o£ mankind who exercise faith in Jehovah God and in Jesus Christ as their redemptive sacrifice will gain a righteous standing with God on* earth through the operation of Christ's kingdom for a ‘ thousand years. His thousand-year reign is near at hand and thereby the realization of the hope of righteousness for men of good-will.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>&quot;Copper-Civilization”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font25">I</span><span class="font14">N 1888 Cecil Rhodes sent an expedition to visit the African chief of the Matabeles, Lobengula. He controlled much of the territory now called Rhodesia, which is named after Rhodes. The expedition was under Charles D. Rudd, and on October 30,1888, was signed the historic “Rudd Concession”. By this agreement Chief Lobengula was to get a thousand rifles, ammunition, £100 a month cash and a steamboat on the Zambezi; in return he was to cede “complete and exclusive charge over all metals and minerals situated and contained” in his domains. Here was indeed a virtual title deed for the Rhodesia of the future, and as soon as Rhodes had it in his hands he approached the government for a Royal Charter and formed the British South African Company for the open</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ing up </span><span class="font14">of Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Though from then on much prospecting and exploring was done, it was not until the late 1920's that real, extensive development was commenced on Northern Rhodesia’s fampus Copper-belt, Today copper-mining is the country’s chief industry (it makes up over 85 percent of the total mineral output), a prosperous modern industry, a top dollar-earner for the British. The Copper-belt, comprising the four mining towns of Luanshya, Nkana, Mufulira and Chingola, has its own refining and smelting plants where the ore is crushed, concentrated and smelted. Electrolytic refining is also carried on. During 1947 close to 200,000 tons of refined copper were produced, with a value of over £20,000,000. One copper mine, besides producing blister and electrolytic copper, also obtained from the ore mined cobalt alloy, gold, silver and selenium. Controlled by British and American interests, “Copper” has become a “multimillion-dollar industry”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>in Northern Rhodesia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">. Let us take a look at this “copper-civilization” by paying a visit to a typical Copper-belt mining town, A mile or two from the mining plant lies the township housing the European employees and their families. It is pleasantly laid out, with the houses spaced well apart yet set in orderly lines along tree-shaded streets. No cramped industrial town this, but more like a garden city. Each house has plenty of ground and most have picturesque and well-tended gardens in which the placid lawns are bordered by a profusion of brightly colored flowers and flowering shrubs. The almost artificial-looking zinnias with their variety of color predominate among the flowers, while the bougainvillaea with its shades of orange, red and purple prevails among the shrubs. Then, to add to the colorfulness of the scene, there are the many flowering trees which line every street. What tree can match the jacaranda when bedecked with its delicate mauve-tinted shawl T</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And it is amid such surroundings that the thousand or so European employees live with their families. The houses they live in, permanent dwellings of red'brick, are of various sizes and are allocated according to the number of the employee’s family. The mining company lets out these homes partly furnished at low rentals averaging about £4 a month. Wages are high, and spending high too. Most families can afford to own a car, and until recently a steady flow of American cars came into the Copper-belt. Now, with the import restrictions on American goods to conserve dollars, the demand for new ears is more than the supply. Parents here can also afford the luxury (?) of having children without undue strain on the bank balance. It has been reported that the Northern Rhodesian Copper-belt has the highest birth rate in the world—certainly there are plenty of young children about, and the staff of doctors and nurses at the well-equipped, company-owned hospital are rarely without maternity, cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To provide their employees with somewhere to spend their leisure time, and incidently to spend some of their surplus cash, the company has built a recreation center. The focal point of social activity is &quot;‘the club*’, a large group of assorted buildings housing a bioscope (cinema)—also used for dancing, gymnasium, library, billiard saloon, tearoom and, of course, the bar. (Northern Rhodesians have the reputation of being hard drinkers.) Adjacent to the club are tennis courts, bowling greens, football and cricket grounds, and, by far the most patronized, a large open-air swimming pool which would do justice to any large city in the States. Not far away is the 18-hole golf course also with its own clubhouse, and bar! The shopping center is to be found in the adjoining government township, where Indians, Jews and Scotsmen vie with one another for the town’s trade.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Condition# for African Native</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Some distance from the European township lies the compound housing the African mine employees and their families^ It has a population of some 30,000; the ratio of native to white labor being about 10 to 1. The Africans living in these compounds enjoy, from the European viewpoint, advantages which they never had in the “bush”. Not that their living conditions are in any way comparable with the European standard; nor is there the attraction of much money earned quickly for them, for their average wage is but a fraction .of that of the white man. The huts are laid out in orderly pattern, with washing places and lavatories located at regular intervals. Attention is given to recreation and social welfare. A native hospital operates for the care of the sick under the supervision of Europeans, as are also the other activities of the compound life. There is even a &quot;club” and bioscope, with “Wild'Westerns” a favorite with the audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is also in the large compounds that the government started experiments in mass-literacy in an effort to reduce the percentage of illiterates among the adult African population. A school is provided for the education of the children. Prominent in the educational field in the compound are Jehovah’s witnesses, and at their local Kingdom Hall of grass and logs as many as 1500 Africans meet weekly lor Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But there is a debit side to the picture. There are disadvantages for both European and African alike. From its birth to its rapid maturity the Copper-belt’s prosperity has intoxicated, literally and figuratively, many of its European beneficiaries, Consumption of liquor per head would rate pretty high in a world survey, and this has brought its inevitable consequences. The saying “money to burn” might have originated here, for almost everybody smokes—50-a-day not being considered unusual. In fact, &quot;a box of 50 and matches” is regarded as almost an essential part of one’s attire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For the European the climate is not favorable. True, the winter, six months of fairly mild rainless sunshine, is pleasant. But the hot months of September and October, before the rains, are too “tropical”, and with the rains come the mosquitoes and malaria. In the early 1930’s malaria was the rule rather than the exception; enteric, blackwater fever and meningitis also took their toll. Today these latter diseases are unusual arid malaria is no longer the danger it was; although, despite the anti-malaria measures, there are always some cases each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The rapid association of so many African natives with European civilization has produced some' big problems. The detribalizing of the natives and their being resettled in large compounds; the quick change-over from a rural, primitive life to urbanization; the sudden impact of civilization; all have had their repercussions. Though finding it difficult to adjust themselves to the different standards of the white man’s way of life, it has been easy for many to absorb its evils. It is readily admitted that the African in the bush, as yet unaffected by civilization, is a better type than his urbanized brother. Not a good recommendation for “civilization”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All the usual difficulties associated with the South African color question are to be found here, and political issues associated with the native problem are prevalent. The effort by the government to introduce trade-unionism among the African mine workers as part of its policy to encourage the African to shoulder more responsibility has been received with mixed feelings by the mining companies and European employees. If, it is asked, trade-unionism among “educat-ecT peoples has produced undesirable results at times, what will it produce among the semieducated Africans Might it not lead to further friction between white and black, with strikes and the possible reoccurrence of riots as in 1936 and 19401 Though it appears that there are many years of commercial prosperity ahead for the Copper-belt, yet it is feared that the future is likely to see a heightening of the native employment problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But the Creator in preparing and enriching the earth for maifs habitation did not have in mind a civilization fraught with such perplexities and problems. He created it to be the eternal dwelling-place of a perfect and righteous race living in peace and prosperity. His purpose will not fail. In the righteous New World at hand this purpose of the Creator will be fulfilled and Obedient mankind will enjoy to the full the riches and blessings of the earth.—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font14">correspondent in Northern Rhodesia.</span></p>

Various proposals were made for the solution of the German problems before them, but nothing of any consequence was arrived ah The agenda consisted Of four main points: (1) German unity; (2) Berlin; (3) a German peace treaty; (4) an Austrian peace treaty. After much discussion Secretary of State Dean Achlson of the U. S. made a proposal (June 8) which gave matters a new turn. The Big Four, who had been able to reach no common approach to anything, felt they ought to pass the buck, so to speak, hence sent a directive to the Berlin trade negotiators to reach an agreement ‘by Monday”, June 13. While waiting for results Russia’s Andrei VI-sbinsky proposed that drafts of a German peace treaty be prepared by the four powers within three months and that occupation troops be withdrawn within a year after a treaty is signed.

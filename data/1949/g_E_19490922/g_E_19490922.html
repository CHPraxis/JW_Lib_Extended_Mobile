<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark28"></a>TELEVISION’S TRIPLE CHALLENGE To Movies, Radio, Home</span></h6>
<p><span class="font24">A</span><span class="font13"> MILLION and a half people now own television sets which they will tell you about and demonstrate as happily as they would show you the new baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But for a variety of reasons, including expense, inaccessibility to telecasting stations, and disappointment with programs and reception, the majority of families might be catalogued by television sales firms as “prospects, decision reserved”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On the other hand, for many crowned heads of radio and the movies, the rise of television has already developed an ominous roar. The public may pleasurably dabble in the lapping waters, but for them, the tide's increase—projected at 3 million receiving seta by 1950, and 400 sending stations by 1951—is like viewing from your beach house the approach of a tidal wave. The chief though silent lamenters in Hollywood, where words were never rare and speechlessness is well-nigh scandalous, have lately resorted to the harried politician's “No. comment” to queries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Pained most acutely are the Big Five in the film industry, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century-Fox, Loew's Inc. (Metro-G-oldwyn-Mayer), and RKO (“so classified because of their control of the theater chains”), the multimillion-dollar picture producers. So rich from former exploits that, quipped one writer, a Big Five executive could not afford the time to pick up a five-dollar bill if he dropped it, they sire now reportedly weeping m theixushampagne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">While the threat to the standard radio broadcasters has been equal to if not more imminent than the menace to the movie monopoly, the transition or conversion to television, which many have commenced, does not offer such thorny problems. In addition, Television’s challenge comes at a time when the cinema combine has other headaches: dwindling home revenue, loss of foreign markets, and the unfavorable U. S. Supreme Court decision on ownership of theater chains. Laden with astronomical overhead and unaccustomed to economies, the major companies can only enter the new and admittedly promising field of making inexpensive half-hour films for television, after severe flesh pounding and painful prunings.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Movies for Telecasting</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To bring this point home it is necessary only to remember that according to production. head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, Dore Schary, a picture cost of “only $1,500,000 isn’t excessiye these days”, while Jerry Fairbanks, Ine., and Hal Roach, formerly famed for their comedies and educational shorts, for example, have turned to the production of “television film quickies” at a few thousand dollars for a half-hour show. It is not always easy to sell 30-minute shorts to television sponsors for these prices;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">so it is easily seen that markets are now, as far as television advertisers are concerned, and may likely always he, nonexistent for million-dollar films.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the present outlook, television, far from supplanting the motion picture, will undoubtedly stimulate its production. Short-sighted American magnates, Who have refused to release any but the oldest films for telecasting, have been surprised at the eager reception of ten-ana fifteen-year-olds. They were even more horrified at the release recently of 52 British films, most of which the movie monopoly had excluded from exhibition in America, and which featured such fine actors as James Mason and Gracie Fields, for </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">telecasting</span><span class="font16"> in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Do these rumblings portend a breach in the censorship barrier also? Will others, to fulfill the expanding need for films for television, which some estimate may reach ten times the present demand for all types of films, turn their talents to this field? Will they then dare to risk the unusual, the varied, the factual, the edifying, breaking through the tiresome-ly circumscribed Hollywood mode? Life’s interests are not limited to &quot;boy meets girl”, religious processions, distortions of history, implausible dilemmas of fortune’s handsome and curvaceous^ sagas of the West, played with the repetitiousness of creative sterility. May the people now begin to learn how to use newly designed </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">jacks,</span><span class="font16"> home modernizing, first-aid procedure, practical landscaping, carpentering, sales approach, public speaking, as well as receiving novel entertainment, all by the effective audio-yisual method? In a word, will the puolic, so much exploited and restricted to religiously censored movie fare, now get a break?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Most authorities believe that telecasts will constitute almost one-half of film presentations. “Motion pictures,” opined Eric </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Johnston,</span><span class="font16"> president of Motion Picture Association, ‘‘in my judgment will be the sturdy backbone of television. I think the overwhelming bulk of television programming will be built on motion pictures for two principal reasons: (1) their guarantee of technical and pro-</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">gramming perfection, and (2) the assurance</span><span class="font16"> of repeat performance and wider distribution, which they can bring television.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Points to Ponder</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Problems of production bombard <sup>&lt;f</sup>live show” dramas. Half-hour plays require 20 hours or more for rehearsal, permit only about as much change of locale as an actor can make in a minute, make script impossible and whispered promptings worse .with consequent strains on players’ </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">unexceptional memories, allow </span><span class="font16">no &quot;retakes”, magnify mistakes, are impractical for circuit exhibitions. Furthermore, when the telecast reaches the receiver it is a motion picture, whether it originates from televising “live” actors </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consequently it is not the demand for pictures that television will curtail. The publicity director of Jerry Fairbanks stated that their company alone last year produced the equivalent of 57 feature pictures, chiefly for television. Compared on a footage basis this exceeds the output of any of the major companies, who, all together, produced an estimated 375 films in 1948. Admittedly the masters of technique, the major studios apparently fear the change-over, if they attempt it, to Jess </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">expensive productions, and loss </span><span class="font16">of theater audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Whistlers in the dark” count on “the gregarious instinct” to maintain theater attendance, even when television has flooded the country with 1,000 stations and a 60,000,000 audience anticipated in five to six years. Others, including the magnate Samuel Goldwyn, look to “phonevision”—a device for sending “called for” feature pictures over individual telephone line at a fee collected with the regular billing—to prevent the dispersion of filmdonfs status quo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However much or little these factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.W AKE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">may modify future changes in public custom, they will not dam one popular trend: If you can see a good movie at home, it will take a much better one to cause you to breast wind, weather, parking problems, traffic hazards, and spend time and money to go out. Indeed the omens are very good for some changes, very interesting to a public buffeted and regimented in their movie fare*</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY GROWS UP1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">A burning question of related interest concerns the course of C a t h o 1 i e censorship of the movies. Television is under the control of the Federal Communications Commission. Already the FCC has issued the dictum forbidding ownership of more than five television stations by a single interest. Paramount, which had invested in DuMont and KTLA and indicated its intention of further entering the field of television, observed the official frown. For this or other reasons two of the Big Five have attempted no invasion of the television field. If then by failure to dominate the television industry, control of the cinema passes frem the hands of the Big Five, what will happen to their self-imposed censorship, placed so cravenly in the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy? Will the Breen office, which kept the major companies cowering in the religious corner, be able to force its dictatorship on the FCC?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Television Races Beyond Forecasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even such enthusiastic developers as David Sarnoff, board chairman of RCA, and called the “Father of American Television” did not envision the full scope of postwar television expansion. In his epochal speech of September, 1947, when there were only 13 stations on the air, his predicted total of 750,000 receiving sets distributed by the end of 1948 encountered some disbelief. Thirty-three percent beyond General Sarnoff’s figure, the yearis close saw approximately a million receivers in operation. Still leaping ahead, the flood is given another startling measure by the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font13"> of April 24,1949:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Today there are 1,500,000 seta, with a regular audience of upward of $000,000. Id one year the number of stations has jumped from sixteen to sixty-four, making television available to 40 percent of the country’s population. . . . By the end of this year it is estimated that 3,000,000 receivers will be in use, and by the end of next year 6,000,000. With</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the opening of coast-to-coast network service, expected in 1953 at the latest, television looks forward in four years to serving 19,000,000 families an&lt;l a total audience of better than 50,000,000. In six’years the number of stations is expected to reach 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Merlin H. Aylesworth, first president of NBC, estimated in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Look,</span><span class="font13"> April 26, 1949, that &quot;by the end of the year 4,000,000 homes will have television” and that . from New York a “coaxial cable will reach the West Coast early next year”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Television^ Beginnings</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The idea of transmitting light and shadow by electricity was suggested as early as 1873, when a telegraph operator noticed that his transmitter worked differently on sunny days from the way it worked on cloudy days. Twenty-five million dollars and much labor, study and research gave the .idea a concentrated treatment to solve the technical problems of television just jip to the close of 1946. Londoners, however^ as early as 1912, witnessed at Selfridges Department Store the first public debut of television carried over wires. Progress slowed for many years. It was not until 1928 that General Electric televised the first great news event—Al Smith accepting the nomination for the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Up until the 1930’s the machinery for television was so heavy that one exhibition collapsed a Baltimore stage. All this ended with the development of the cathode-ray tubes, credited to Vladimir Zworykin and Philo T. Farnsworth. Yet amusing defects pestered the manufacturer. At times the entire picture dissolved in a snowstorm effect An actor often appeared in duplicate or triplicate. At times the back of an actor would stick to a chair while the front of him would get up and walk across the stage, the intermediate part stretching out like an accordion. In another case the red sash of a dancer televised the same color as the background. On the receiving set she 'performed her number with a large section sawed out of her waist. While television still has several types of interference, particularly from generators of near-by airplanes, the images are often very clear-cut. Plans are presently under way to commercially produce sets that transmit color, although some years may elapse before </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">they reach the </span><span class="font13">general market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theaters and producers have been quick to adapt television for screen exhibition. Paramount in New York, about a year ago, presented “the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font13"> fullscreen theater telecast of a news event” —a Brooklyn prize fight; In June, 1948, &quot;Twentieth Century Fox, using equipment developed in collaboration with RCA and Warner Brothers, successfully projected the Louis-Walcott fight on the screen of the Fox Theater in Philadelphia. This was the first time that a major news or sporting event originating at a distant point—in this case New York—was projected directly on a theater screen in another city.” By 1952, it is expected, most important theaters will have television screens. For theater screen presentation the telecast is either enlairged by lens or “kinetoscoped (filmed) and almost instantaneously fed through the regular projector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Problems Posed by Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Since virtually every part of television is four or five times as expensive as radio, and since few sponsors feel that they can get returns comparable to news or radio advertising, television is still in the red. NBC's television loss is said to equal $13,000 per day. In order to reach only a fraction of radio's audience, the telecasting sponsor must pay </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">more </span><span class="font13">for time than in radio. One New York affiliate of a telecasting network charges $1,500 for an evening's hour, while the comparable radio charge is $1,400. In addition, the sponsor must pay for show productions which in the case of the Ford Television Theater run to $20,000 for each performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, the effectiveness of the sight ^and sound advertisement is capturing the attention of large-budget advertisers. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Radio Best</span><span class="font13"> states that the Coca Cola Company has canceled three of its radio shows. <sup>ff</sup>The money is going in video.” Application of the adage that a picture is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">worth ten thousand words</span><span class="font13"> may lead theaters to telecast movie trailers (previews) to lure the alleged forty percent of the population who do not attend. Reputable advertisers are apt to be able to present a more accurate display or demonstration of their product This field is beckoning, particularly as the number of set owners multiplies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides money, television takes a lot of room on the air. The effort to accommodate many stations to the air, without interference, has called forth diligent effort and vast research, “Because it transmits both sight and sound the television station requires a channel 6,000 kilocycles wide. The channel of a radio station is ten kilocycles.” The band formerly used exclusively for teleyision, the very high frequency band (VHF), has been found inadequate as accommodating</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">only about 7 stations to a locality* Now another band, the ultra high frequency band (UHF), has been approved by FCC. The opening of this band will permit “sufficient stations to provide a television system comparable to today's radio setup”. It is said that present sets can be adapted for use on the new band for about $50,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When will television come to the ratals t Again expense makes the answer difficult. Television signals can usually be picked up only from 50 to 100 miles from the station telecasting. In connecting distant towns in networks the signal of such tremendous band width must be carried by a special conductor called a coaxial cable. Only recently the East was connected with the Middle West as far as St, Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In addition to extending the networks to the West, full coverage of the United States includes the installation of relay towers or the flying of airplanes on fixed courses. The system of picking up signals by planes and retelecasting is called “stratovision”. By this method, one scientist believes, transoceanic hookups will be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effect on Radio and Home Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As far as radio is concerned the forecasts of its life expectancy are constantly shortened. A year ago the’patent was thought to have ten or fifteen more years to go. Comes now a bulletin just released by </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting</span><span class="font13"> that a poll of the &quot;majority” of 35 leaders in &quot;radio, television, advertising, and allied fields”, “people who are close' to the picture/’ thought that by 1954 television will practically supplant radio. Aylesworth predicted that ^within three years the broadcast of sound, or ear radio, over giant networks will be wiped out. Powerful network television will take its place”. This transition is going to be costly. A modest radio station costs $100,000.. A modest television station costs a million dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When this scientific “child” has the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER S2<sub>f</sub> 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">run of the house, what then! What about the effect <sup>on</sup> human children brought up </span><span class="font13">under the influence of a continuous show in the living room! At present it is said they sit justas goggle-eyed before sporting events as they do at Howdy Doody o» the Lucky Pup. One set owner complained that now his two young daughters are doing nothing but wrestling. Whether the children are at last forced to take time for homework, and whether father ever rebels against endless television guests and the inevitable coldspam dinners, it is certain that the new gimmick will affect American life profoundly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The day is hastened by cheaper sets. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Radio Best</span><span class="font13"> says that the best equipment obtainable costs only $500, that any price paid above that is charged for cabinet accessories, finish, etc. Sets with small screens can be purchased for $100. As an integral part of American life television will likely develop its opportunities for intimate appeal to the family group. The householder will probably be drawn in more as a participator than in audience’ of the show. International telecasts may encourage good-wilL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Exposure of the insincere campaign demagoguery and ballyhoo, revealed more readily under the camera eye, may affect the political picture. The same searching scrutiny may embarrass the correspondent accustomed to slant and garble his news stories. Specifically, may not the vast size of the conventions of Jehovah's witnesses, usually belittled by the press, appear through television in their true perspective! May not Jehovah let the joyful, beautiful young faces, speaking gracious . words, light up some of the despondent homes seeking comfort! In this changing world of crisis, television may indeed open up a more truthfully anatomical dissection of life, and release it to public gaze. Just how it eventually may be used by the Maker of light and sound will be interestedly watched by all true Christians.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">The total peace of the New World wil. be ushered in through righteous tota war. Men should not object to this. They justify their carnage by the peace they promise will follow, but which never seems to quite catch up to mankind. However, the promised peace that follows hard on the heels of righteous war will overtake the generation now living on the earth.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wvr<sub>f</sub></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Famthe, Pestilence</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After the white horse comes a /horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword”. In 1914 and thereafter this red horse of war has run wild, pounding the seas of humanity with its steel-shod hoofs, leaving in its bloody wake millions of maimed and dying and dead. This notches Jesus’ words at Matthew 24: 3,7 that at His enthronement in heaven nation would rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. Right </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font13"> time, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">when the Gentile</span><span class="font13"> ?¥mes ended in 1914 and Christ’s reign began, World War I broke over the earth and the red horse of war ran wild.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After the red horse, 'T,o a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his nand. And I heard a voice . - . say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.” Food wag to be scarce, rationed, doled out in small quantities. The black horse of famine was to ride in the wake of the red horse of war, and the facts show that from and after 1914 famine has claimed more lives than war. Only three years ago it was widely published that one-fourth of the world, some 500,(XX),(XXJ persons, were starving. Again this matches Jesus’ words at Matthew 24 predicting famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And He also said there would be unprecedented pestilence, and in Revelation 6 we see after the black horse of famine comes a “pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell [the grave] followed with him'\ Since 1914 the pale horse of pestilence has wasted humanity worse than war and famine. Even the advances of modem medical science have failed to overhaul the runaway horge of pestilence, have failed to stem the rising tide of plague and disease. Cholera, polio, cancer, heart disease, and many others, are knocking over victims as never before in man’s history, and the psychiatrists recently said that the mere publicity given to the mounting toll of such killers as cancer and heart disease is turning the people pale and sick and neurotic with fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Does this not dovetail with Jesus’ prophecy that there would be &quot;upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the -sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth”? (Luke 21: 25,26) Since Satan and his demons were shaken out of heaven to this earth they have been bombarding men with woe after calamitous woe. War, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, racial prejudice and religious hate, these are but a few. Without needlessly consuming space to point out a parallel at once obvious, read the following description of the &quot;last days” and note how our times match:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mark this, there are hard times coming in the last days. For men will be selfish, fond of money, boastful, haughty, abusive disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, irreverent, callous, relentless, scurrilous, dissolute, and savage; they will hate goodness, they will be treacherous, reckless and conceited, preferring pleasure to God—for though they keep </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 22, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">up a form of [true] religion, they will have nothing to do with it as a force. Avoid all &amp;ruch. Bad characters and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves,—-2 Timothy 3:1-5,13, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt*</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Total War Before Total Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After Jehovah God through Hiff witnesses has given full warning and called attention to the signs marking the ‘‘last days”, then &quot;‘shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be”. (Matthew 24:21) That tribulation will be the righteous war of Armageddon, a total war that will open the portals to total peace, It is not a needless slaughter on' God’s part. It is realistic, practical- His purpose is to create a new world, not repair and . repaint this old one. He does not purpose to put a new patch on an old garment; the entire will be new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Would you plant a garden in a weedpatch? This world has become a weed-patch, a hotbed of bloody militarism, grafting politicians, cheating commercial giants, hypocritical religious parasites, treacherous'trucebreakers, immoral delinquents and hardened criminals. And in their midst they cultivate such thorns and thistles and poisonous plants as racial hate, religions prejudice, blasphemous dogma, creature-worship, athe-lam, and that silly, silly myth of evolution. This wicked world has become a global weedpatch infested with insects and pests, and Jehovah God will plow it under to make way for a completely new world of total peace!</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Over the hill of Armageddon will unfold'vistas of peace, limitless horizons of peace. Abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth. How war-weary humanity will delight itself in the haven of peace that will encompass the globe! And it </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font13"> be a peace far surpassing the dreams of men and nations. Peace on every front. Total peace.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Peace Between Men, Animate, Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace between men. Now men and nations beat plowshares and pruninghooks into weapons, make scientific study, of warfare, and burst </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">into</span><span class="font13"> a red explosion of cftrnage that gives the world a bloodbath. But none of that folly in the New World!—“They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into prumnghooks: nation shall not lift u$ a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more/<sup>3</sup> (Micah 4:3,4) The red horse of war will he stabled forever 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace between men and animals. Now men trap and slaughter, vivisect and torture animals, kill for mere sport rather than for necessary food, till the very scent of man strikes terror in animal hearts and sends them flying for cover. And in the woods some animals prey on men. But this enmity will vanish in the New World: “In that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the ^eld, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely/’—Hosea </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace among the animals themselves. Now they prey upon one another, in a constant hunt to kill that they might live. Only through death of others is the road</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">10</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">to life for themselves. Not so in the post Armageddon world: “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox &quot;&nbsp;(Isaiah 11:6,7) Even the roaring lion turns vegetarian!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace between man and the earth. When man was expelled from Eden he was told that the ground would bring forth thorns and thistles and that only by the sweat of his brow would he be able to wrest his food from the earth. It has been a constant battle against poor soil, crop failure, drought, weeds, thorns anjl thistles, insects and plant disease, for man to eke food from the ground to stave off famine. But after Armageddon the promise will apply: “Instead of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thorn</span><span class="font13"> shall come np the fir tree, and instead of the brier snail come up the myrtle tree. . , . Then shall the earth yield her increase.&quot; (Isaiah 55:13; Psalm 67:6) No more will the black horse of famine trample life from millions of bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peace Within Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace between man and his own body. As soon as man is born body cells are used up and must be replaced. While young he wages a winning war, making more cells than die oft, and as a result grows in size. After maturity he holds his own for some twenty years, renewing the cells about as fast as they are consumed. But as old age approaches and vigor wanes, his body cells perish faster than they are replaced, and muscle shrinks, skin shrivels, bones become brittle, senses dull. Degeneration catches the creature and death inexorably takes over. If he does </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">hot</span><span class="font13"> die of old ago, war </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font13"> famine or pestilence cuts off his existence. Constantly the body fights disease, but in the end bows to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But no waging of losing warfare to</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font13"> TF A </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">K E I </span><span class="font13">disease and degeneration and death in Jehovah's new world! Flesh will return to the freshness of childhood, and stay that Way. No inhabitant will then say he is sick, for Jehovah will bring in health and cure and heal all diseases. Death itself will be destroyed as eternal life triumphs. (Job 33:25; Psalm 103:3; Isaiah 33:24; Jeremiah 33:6; Revelation 21:4) Stabled to no more ride roughshod over suffering humanity, the red horse and black horse and pale horse and the grave that followed after lose forever their power “to kill men with sword and famine and plague”—Revelation 6:8, Jfo/-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">fait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Peace between mind and flesh. Now men may be fully set in their minds to do good, but the good intentions often return void, mockingly. The mind may be righteously disposed, directed by God's Word, desirous above all else of living up to requirements; only to fail in the face of the lusts of fallen flesh. Willing mind and spirit, but weak flesh of imperfection! Even this conflict will end, victory over sin coming from God through </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Christj as perfection of mind and body </span><span class="font13">bring peace to this internal battleground. The apostle Paul put it in forceful simplicity, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We know that the law is spiritual, but I am physical, sold into slavery to sin. I do not understand what I am doing, for I do not do what 1 want to do; I do things that I hate. But if I do what I do not want to do, I acknowledge that the law is right. In reality, it is not I that do these things; it is sin, which has possession of me. For I know that nothing good resides in that is, in my physical self; I can will, but I cannot dp what is right. I do not do the good things that I want to do; I do the wrong things that 1 do not want to do. But if I do the things that I do not want to do, it is not I that am acting, it is sin, which has possession of me, I find the law to be that I who want tx</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">But even during this time of unprecedented woe peace is possible. It is the &quot;peace of God, which passeth all understanding” (Philippians 4:7) Possessors of this peace do not have the fear of the future that now causes distress of unctions and perplexity and heart failures. They see the woes today and know that they come from Satan the Devil, that they are the death-throes of &quot;this present evil world”, that they are the foretold signs that soon Jehovah God's glorious new world will shine through to dispel forever the gloomy darkness that hangs like a pall over the peoples of earth. Those who have eyes to see these things and ears to hear them look up and lift up their heads and rejoice.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">C </span><span class="font10">Female scorpions, spiders and mantiees carry matters to the extreme. Unless the male beats a quick'retreat after fathering the next generation he is liable to be gobbled up by his own mistress. A»d no wonder, since in many cases the ladies, if they can be called that, are 20, 50 or 100 times as big as their husbands.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">C </span><span class="font10">Many other dwarf males, whose mistresses want to dominate the household, decide they might as well take it easy and live the life of a parasite while the female rustles for a living. For example, the male of a certain worm-like marine creature, being a wee mite only one-fifteenth the size of the female, climbs on board her proboscis, works his way into her mouth, and finally finds a little recess in the excretory duct where he lives until his services are needed to fertilize the eggs as they pass out. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">C </span><span class="font10">In another case where the female Mr-self feeds as a parasite in the gill chambers of shrimps, the male would never find her unless he tagged along on her apron strings. So as a parasite on a parasite the male takes up living quarters in the posterior appendages of the female before she enters the shrimp.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">W</span><span class="font13">HEN in the year 1945 Berlin was taken over by the four powers of occupation—U. S. A., Great Britain, Russia, and at last France—the four seemed to be of one heart and one mind. But Big Four warmth soon chilled and the cold war broke out. The crisis was brought to its climax by the introduction of the Western mark as separate currency for Western Germany, and thereafter the introduction of they Eastern mark in Eastern Germany arid for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font13"> of Berlin, as the Russians declared. Therewith they claimed the economic control over the whole ciiyTwith the argument tha^ Berlin be a part of the Eastern zone. The Western powers raised the objection that the Western sectors belong to the West, and they introduced the Western mark in Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The political structure of the whole city as well as the so far existing commercial communication between Eastern and Western Germany now became strongly influenced and more and more stagnating by these two different currencies, caused by political and commercial stubbornness. The exchange of goods between East and West ceased fully, because the Russians clamped on their blockade and Western Berlin became an island; or, as the Western Berlin press expressed it. “the besieged fortress of the cold war?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Airbridge</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even in normal times it is a problem to supply three and a half million in a city with food, fuel and clothing. So when the West</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEP</span><a href="http://riS3fiJE.fi"><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">TEMBER 2</span></a><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">era powers answered the blockade with the declaration that they would feed their sectors by airplane,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the Eastern press responded with roaring laughter. Daily the papers wrote of the impossibility of such an undertaking. But what in the beginning seemed to be a dream became a matter of course. In summer of 1948, thousands of people stood round the airfields in Berlin, Tempelhof and Gatow, but in spring 1949 the airbridge was no more a sensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the beginning not only the Russians and the masses standing under Russian rule doubted that it would be possible to bring the necessary amount of goods to Berlin, but also many of the* people of Western Berlin were quite prepared that the enterprise would end in a failure and they would come under the power of the Soviets. Even after the airbridge had functioned nine months, the Eastern press announced that the ‘/rats were leaving the ship”, meaning that the responsible politicians and economists were moving into Western Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But when the airbridge had served its purpose for some time, the Western Allies suddenly raised the daily food rations of the population, to show the efficiency of their enterprise. This provoked the Russians to raise the rations as well in their sector, and, at the same time, they invited the Western Berliners to get their food from them; and, since winter was at the door, they offered 18 hundredweight of coal per household* But, astonishing as it seems, only very few people made use of this offer.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490922_files/g_E_19490922-14.png" alt="" style="width:485pt;height:170pt;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">After the Western powers had improved the two airfields in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Gatow</span><span class="font13"> and Tempelhof (American) and erected a third airfield in the French sector, they really proved that it is possible not only to feed two million people by means of the airbridge, but also to transport the necessary coal for the production of electricity, packed in sacks in the Ruhr district and brought into Berlin by airplane, One of the Berlin papers, Per </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Abend </span><span class="font13">(The Evening), reported on April 6, 1949, that in March, 1949, 100,000 tons of coal had been brought into the city, against 17,000 in the beginning. If the neutral observer stood outside one of.the blocked airfields, especially in Tempelhof, nearly in the center of Berlin, he was able to watch a really splendid achievement* The constant landing and starting with the employment of radio communication and the radar instruments is proof of an organization that can be compared to the clockwork of a chronometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Everything possible is transported over the airbridge. AH kinds of victuals, iron and steel for handicraft and industry, coal, petrol and raw oil for autos and machinery for the production of light, papers in large rolls for the many daily papers of Western Berlin, textiles, shoes, etc. Yes,’ as unbelievable as it sounds, even thousands of young trees for the replanting of Berlin's famous park the “Tiergarten&quot; have been brought over by plane, <sub>&lt;h</sub>in spite of the fact that there are in the surroundings of Berlin many nursery gardens, from where enough trees could be brought into Berlin in a few minutes. Much of the goods, however, are flowing into the secret channels of the black market. In spite of the strong guard much finds its way into the hated East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The enormous costs of the airbridge are borne partly by the Allies, and partly</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">14</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">by the taxpayers of Western Germany and Berlin. While the unprejudiced observer acknowledges the efficiency of the airbridge, the latter is in reality—after the Western powers declared themselves the defenders of the Western democracy —a question of prestige. At the same time it is a splendid military training for the pilots in blind and night flights. It is a demonstration of Western power, a showcase of Western democracy toward an advancing Eastern enemy.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Breathing Space During the Cold War</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When in the first days of May rumors about the lifting of the blockade went through the world, hundreds of thousands of Berlin’s citizens just smiled in skepticism and said: “We do hear the message, but believe it we cannot P Too often they had been disappointed by the many vetoes and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Nfa's</span><span class="font13"> (no's) or the Russians. But when on May 12 the turnpikes at the control-points of the zone boundary went up, there was new hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Their eyes were turned toward Paris, where in fruitless discussions the four ministers of foreign affairs made efforts to end another one of the many unsuccessful conferences “successfully”, Was it not that one of the points in the program concerned their city? The only success of the many public and secret conferences during several weeks seems to be the.very doubtful product of the “modus vivendi” with regard to Berlin, the Russians binding themselves not to inflict a blockade again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What was it that made the Russians yield? Doubtless the airbridge, which naw existed a whole year, had given the proof that the Western powers are not to be pushed out of Berlin unless by force of arms. Furthermore, the industries of the Russian-occupied zone urgently needed raw materials, tools and parts of machinery manufactured in Western Germany, to be able to meet the requirements of the Russian power of occupation, namely, to procure more toward the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font13">costs of reparations. It even seems that the ceasing of the blockade permits a breathing space in the cold war, whereby both parties want to gain time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There will be no peace treaty made with Germany for the time being. Germany and Berlin must further on remain split up in two spheres of interest, in spite of the tremendous propaganda of “unity and just peace”. The Western powers announce; “Germany must become free, peaceful, industrious, healthy and prosperous I This is the main object of the American politics” (McCloy, July 2,1949, in a press conference) With help of the EBP (the Marshall Plan) they want to filter new vigor into the living corpse of Germany and to continue using Berlin as a showcase for Western power, Western standard of living and Western democracy. On the other hand, the East believes in the victory of the communistic idea by propaganda, by the failure of the Marshall Plan, by elimination of free expression of one’s opinion and by spying and ruling the people with all means of a system of totalitarian power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even with the blockade lifted, the Americans and the British did not think of withdrawing the airbridge. “The time of its discontinuance is a military question.” (McCloy, July 2 in Berlin) After the cessation of the blockade trains and thousands of motor vehicles, in addition to the average 800 to 1,000 airplanes daily, bring coal, food (even all kinds of luxuries), clothing and all sorts of articles for daily use. The Russians have agreed to allow daily 16 goods trains to roll into Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But sure enough, they try to keep control over the import. While the consignments for the German Economy Commission, which is under their control, never are refused, the trains carrying mail and motor vehicles with Western Berlin as destination are stopped and led to the Eastern sector for .“control”. Both parties overwhelm each other with protests, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 22<sub>t</sub> 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">repiyofs about breaches of contracts. Manifestly the Russians do not want the abundance of goods in the Western world to have any detrimental propagandistic $ifect. Motorists report that when passing the Russian zone on the highroads hungry begging children try to block their way to get something of the load which their vehicles carry.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Strike of the Railway Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The railway in Germany, which used to be an institution of the state, is now under the control of the Russians in the whole of the Eastern zone and in Eastern and Western Berlin. The payment of the employees of this institution was made in Eastern marks. But because the Western Berliners—since the introduction of the Western mark as sole means of payment in their sectors—have to meet their liabilities in Western money, 16,000 railwaymen living in Western Berlin came into the position that they practically get only one-sixth of their wages. (The Western mark has much higher purchasing power, and many exchange their Eastern money—in the proportion of 6 to 1—at the money changers in the streets.) Therefore they requested the payment of their wages to 100 percent m Western marks, acknowledgment of their independent union by the Russian railway management, and no reprisals toward the strikers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This strike lasted five weeks. As a result the electrical city railway inside the Western sectors and all railway lines crossing Berlin were idle. The Russians tried to end this strike by force in ordering thousands of policemen out of the Russian zone into Berlin. Shots fell and there were dead and wounded. But the 16,000 railwaymen remained steadfast under the protection.of the Western powers. But there was danger that the Parisian Conference would become impossible, and therefore the Western military commanders gave the order to break up the strike. The railwaymen have the as-suranee, indeed, tha, their wages paid in Western marks, but neither has their organization been acknowledged nor do they have fail protection against the measures of reprisal from their Russian-controlled employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The end of the strike creates the foundation for regulated railway eommuni-eatoon upon the one-traek railway Unes from Western Germany to Berlin, but there is no guarantee for an unlimited import without control and a possible confiscation of the goods by the Russians. The blockade may start again at any time.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> correspondent in Germany.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Buddhism’s Twin Sister</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">V The following is quoted from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Papery, the Foe of the- Church and of the Republic,</span><span class="font10"> by Joseph 8. Van Dyke, pages 98-100:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That Romanism is indeed the twin sister of the Buddhist religion none surely can deny. A comparison of the two will force conviction upon even the most incredulous. Antedating Christianity by several centuries, and spreading over all the countries inhabited by what are now known as the Indo-European races, Buddhism has ever had, and now has, precisely those features which mark the Papal Church, consisting partly of maxims of morality and partly of dogmas of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">faith on</span><span class="font10"> subjects transcending the reach of reason, it rests conjointly on the authority of certain sacred books and the decisions of early councils—called, like Rome's oecumenical, and blindly venerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The worshippers of Buddha in Burmah, Siam, and the Chinese Empire-—numbering more than the adherents of any other religious system known in either ancient or modern times—have their relics and their images, the objects of supreme veneration; their temples costing fabulous sums of mc&amp;ey; their saints canonized by ecclesiastical authority; their priests with shaven heads, vowing chastity, poverty and obedience; their wax candles burning night and day; their penances and self-inflicted tortures; their endless traditions, and hair-splitting moral distinctions; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">even their confessional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“They have also their Lent, when for four or five weeks all the people are supposed to live on vegetables and fruits; their acts of merit, repetition of prayers, fasting, offerings to the images, celibacy, voluntary poverty, enforced devotions, and munificent gifts* to temples, monasteries and idols. Even the rosary, a string of beads used in saying prayers, and supposed by Papists to be a device specially revealed to St. Dominic, is part of the sacred machinery of the devout Buddhist. *1? “And their monasteries, into which priests retire from the world, and engage in the instruction of the young, especially in the mysteries of their sacred books, almost startle one by their close resemblance to those of Popery. And to see the worshippers of Buddha, each with a rosary in his hand, pmstmte </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">themselves before an image</span><span class="font10"> And repeat their prayers, whilst priests in gaudy vestments, bowing before lighted candies, mutter their incantations in a language which has long since ceased to be spoken, forces upon even the least reflecting the conviction that though Rome has ever claimed the power of working miracles, she has shown little inventive genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Not even are shrines and sacred, places a monopoly with Rome. There are plenty of them, and pilgrims- too, in India. And why not, since they have their preaching friars, spending their time alternatively in sacred oratory and in begging- Nay, even modern miracles, though by no means so numerous, and certainly not so astounding, are performed by Rome’s elder sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If “And to complete the picture, they have their infallible pontiff. At Lhfissa, as well </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">as at Rome, </span><span class="font10">dwells one whom the faithful </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">make believe</span><span class="font10"> cannot jerr when speaking </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedrd.</span><span class="font10"> With two infaj-libles, one in Asia and one in Europe, the world certainly ought not to err in faith and morale I&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">with our burdens of modern civilization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Let us board the modern magic carpet, a twin-motored plane of the Pan American World Airways at Miami at breakfast time and fly southward. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day we come into view of one of the wealthiest countries in South America, Venezuela, a country that is distinguished by the fact that it has no national debt</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Our first approach is a view of Lake Maracaibo, which is shaped like a bottle ready to be filled from the Gulf of Maracaibo. It is a larger lake than we can possibly imagine even from our high aerial view, for it covers 8,000 square miles, and from the narrow entrance at the Gulf to the far end is a distance of 125 miles, and at its widest point it is over 70 miles across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Lake Maracaibo has taken on an international interest today because of its great yield of oil, making it one of the largest, producers of petroleum in the world. It was discovered in 1499 by a Spanish explorer, Alonso de Ojeda. On entering the lake he and his fellow explorers noticed the thatched huts oh stilts—Indian villages which had been built out in the shallow waters*as a protection from their rival enemies and the wild animals that roamed the region. Because these lake dwellings reminded the</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">explorers of the Venetian waterways, they called the country </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Venezuela,</span><span class="font13"> meaning “Little Venice”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As we step out of the plane at Maracaibo, second-largest city in Venezuela, a gust of hot, humid air strikes us in the face. We feel as though we were stepping into the middle of a frying pan.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Market, Place</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What we want mostly to see is the market place, an institution which will be passing away with the encroachment of modern civilization. We’ go direct to the water front where there are two huge </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">mercados,</span><span class="font13"> a Spanish word for “markets”. These are large covered buildings containing dozens of booths where one can buy the many varieties of tropical fruits and vegetables that are brought down from the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are also sections where cheese is sold, and farther along is the meat market, where hung-up pieces of bloody meat are arranged in rows and oir the counters are the tails, eyes, brains and livers of the animals, which the natives relish. Sandwiched in oetween these booths are tiny restaurant stalls where the farmers stop to get a plate of fried meat or black beans and strips of plantain fried in oil, a fruit very much resembling the banana but larger. The stench of Jhis indoor market makes us want to get outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We walk along the streets, or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">calles </span><span class="font13">as they are called in Spanish, where there are dozens of canvas-roofed stalls. Their wares are spread far out into the street, and every article from safety pins to expensive cameras, from birds and</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font13">ducklings to lambs, kids and little pigs can be bought. As we linger at one of these stands a little Indian boy tugs at oar clothing sad begs for money. We are told that the Indians depend on begging for their means of support, and the children are early trained to hold out their hand to evesy passer-by. The women have suspended from a band around their forehead or top of their head large, heavy bags filled with food that the good people of Maracaibo have given them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are almost startled as we find ourselves staring at the Indian women with painted faces. Many have their entire cheeks and chin covered with a thick paint of either bright red, orange, brown or black. It is difficult to find an explanation of the custom, because when questioned they will merely say, &quot;To protect our faces from the sun/' Many natives believe it is a mark of their civil state, that is, whether they are virgins, married, or widows. Their long flowing gowns made from brightly colored cotton or rayon have large Bertha collars and long, loose sleeves. They often have a trim of fancy braid or rickrack, and a flounce af the bottom that drags the dirty streets except when they lift it up as was the custom of society in the days gone by. On their sandals are large pompons made from brightly colored wool yarn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is ever-changing scenery in the market streets. Instead of waiting for the city to install park benches for the weary shopper, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the Indian women gather </span><span class="font13">up their loose-flowing gowns and squat right down on the sidewalks and sit on their &quot;haunches” for long periods. There are the ever-present photographers with their painted backgrounds and little stiff chairs waiting to take your picture and develop it while you wait. Tnere are the coffee venders selling tiny cups of strong, black coffee. Down the road comes a burro ambling through the dust, half hidden under the load of his rider and two large barrels filled with bakery goods for sale.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Primitive Bookkeeping</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We decide we have seen enough of the market, so we take a ride out to the outlying </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">aeetions of the eity and stop in to </span><span class="font13">visit a small corner grocery store. There we find they still use primitive methods of bookkeeping. There are a couple dozen small bottles hanging on hooks, partially filled with kernels qf corn. Each bottle represents a customer, and each Kernel of corn represents a unit of currency. Each time the customer makes a charge purchase the kernels are dropped into the bottle, and at the end of the month, when the customer comes in to pay his bill, the bottle is emptied on the counter, the kernels are counted and the bill is paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As we turn away from the little grocery store we look out over the neighborhood and see hundreds of little houses broiling in the sun. Some are made of cardboard, others from large wooden boxes, cement, brick and clay. Glistening in the heat are the roofs of tin and tile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Riding back to the airport we note the many new beautiful homes and modern buildings being erected by commercial houses, modem hospitals, paved streets, clubhouses, and small parks. For a moment <sub>(</sub>We forget that we are in South America and feel as though we were driving along a boulevard in Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the sun sets on a busy day we have time to feast our eyes on the beautiful flowering trees of the tropics. We see many beautiful flamboyant trees with their bright orange flowers, the lovely orchid trees and the bougainvillaea of purple and red alongside, the stately palms, all of which makes us glad that nature will not change its customs as will the customs of these fascinating people we saw in the market today. The increase of wealth derived from the discovery of oil will soon make the primitive market place of today but a picture in our album of memory.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> correspondent in Venezuela.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Jersey Justice, Low and High</span></h5>
<p><span class="font25">r</span><span class="font10">HE ease of the “Trenton Six” dates back to January </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">27,</span><span class="font10">1948. On that day a second* hand furniture dealer and his wife were attacked in a petty holdup and as a result the husband died the next day. The wife said the attackers were three white men or light-skinned Negroes. Another witness testified he saw only two teenage Negroes leave the store. During the next two weeks special police squads made an intensive search for the killers, and in the end rounded up, not two, not three, hut six Negroes, none of whom were teen-agers. These, it was announced, had confessed to the murder,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When brought to trial all six men denied and repudiated their “confessions”, declaring that they signed such under the duress of “third degree” police tortures which had lasted four days, during which time they were held incommunicado and were permitted to see no one. Without such extortion of confession, which U. 8. Supreme Court decisions have declared of no value, the state's case against the six would have fallen flat. More than 30 witnesses—neighbors, employers and co-workers—testified that the accused were far from the scene of the crime at the time. The judge also refused to allow fingerprint records to be entered that were supposed to show defendants’ fingerprints on soda pop bottles used to club the victim; but after the trial it was admitted there were no prints on the bottles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">*1? The trial lasted 44 court days and cost Mercer county $72,000, thus making it the longest and most expensive ease in New Jersey history. At its conclusion, the all-white jury declared the six men “guilty”, and, because the jury failed to recommend mercy, the judge, on August 6, 1948, sentenced all six to die in the electric chair. The public, already shocked by the police tactics in “solving” the murder, were stunned by the court's verdict and sentence, the first mass conviction for murder in the state. During the months following the conviction, while an appeal was being taken to the higher courts, certain newspapers and left-wing political parties began a concentrated campaign of propaganda. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">National Guardian,</span><span class="font10"> styled as a progressive weekly papery the Communist </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily ’EPTEMBEH 22, 1949</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worker</span><span class="font10"> and the Civil Rights Congress, labeled subversive by Attorney General Tom Clark (dow appointed to Supreme Court by Truman), were quick to see the gross errors of the trial and they seised the opportunity to stop forward in the role of champions for civil Liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Using this case to fan the flames of racial hatred, they called it “one of the most sordid, cold-blooded, fascist-like attacks upon the Negro people ever witnessed in America”, a **frame-up”, a “lynching Northern style” arflS a “Northern Scottsboro case”. They circulated petitions to arouse the public, and, for publicity's sake, an attempt was made to have the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations investigate the case. Communist elements in England and France picked up the story as grist for their machines. For example, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds News</span><span class="font10"> of England headlined it: “They Must Die for Being Black.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the six had spent many months in the death-house, the case finally came before New Jersey’s highest tribunal composed of seven jurors, which handed down a unanimous decision reversing the lower court and ordering a new trial. This Supreme Court did bo, not because of pressure from the Civil Rights Congress, as the CRC boasted, but because of gross errors in the trial record. For example, the lower court judge, in refusing to allow fingerprint evidence to enter the record, violated the Constitutional rights of the defendants; the judge also eiVed in hie charge to the jury; and the jury failed to specify the degree of guilt.</span></p>

Again, the higher courts of the land have shown higher integrity to justice in setting aside a low-justice decision of a lower court, when such violated the civil, human and Constitutional rights of the citizen. The laurels of victory in this case, therefore, fall around the neck of the American judicial system with its safeguards, rather than on the necks of those who seek to overthrow the system, and who “muscle in” on this case as a means of spreading their propaganda. As to the charge that this was a racial case, the American Civil Liberties Union reported that “there is no evidence of racial discrimination in the record”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">I</span><span class="font16">N 1943 the first comprehensive medical care measure, to be financed by taxation, was defeated by Congress of the United States. Although some form of “socialized” or “state medicine” has been adopted by forty foreign countries, including Britain and Canada, American doctors, legislators, social and religious organizations', are still plunged into a battle that promises to be intensified in the months to come. The American Medical Association has assessed all of its 140,000 members a fee of $25 each to cover expenses of an “all-out” fight against state- or government-paid medical service. While spearheading the attack, they have enlisted other organizations to help—the American Legion and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On the opposing line-up are the advocates of the Truman bill for nation-wide compulsory health insurance, following the British “womb to tomb” model, “designed to meet all the ordinary hazards of life”, and sponsored by Senators Murray, Wagner, Pepper, Chavez, Taylor, McGrath and Humphrey, and Representatives Dingell and Bierniller. Enlisted in their support are both major trade unions, AEL and CIO, most farm organizations, many liberal organizations, and a contingent from the doctors themselves, variously estimated as between .15,000 and 20,000. Aware that something must be done the Republicans have introduced substitute bills. Review of the power of the forces involved, and the intensity of their animosity, foretells a bitter struggle that will probably reach its final phase in the next session of Congress. Meanwhile the public will be assailed with argument and propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Need</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Practically all of the controversial forces agree that most Americans do not get adequate medical attention. The recently announced census figures gave the United States population as 148,000,000. Of this number estimates as to how many received adequate attention reach as low as 3| million, and the most optimistic will admit that nearly a hundred million people are neglected medically to various degrees. This means that for lack of facilities, lack of funds, or for lack of inclination, the vast majority of American citizens do not get sufficient medical attention. “Comprehensive plans, including preventive care, [include] only St-million people . . . Eighty-five million Americans have no protection against crippling sickness,” says Senator Hubert H. Humphrey. Said Representative Andrew J. Bierniller:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Voluntary health insurance, excellent aid though it is, affords comprehensive medical care to not more than 4,000,000 persons. The great clamor about how 45,000,000 are covered by some plan or other—and therefore there is no need for any further concern—is definitely misleading. Twenty-five millions of these 45,000,000 have insurance for hospitalization only. Others have even less adequate protection. Furthermore, many voluntary plans, including those operated by state and county medical societies, have contracts full of jokers. When you need to claim benefits you, find that you are so beset with ifs, ors and whereases, that you end up by owing the doctor and the hospital a lot more than you bargained for. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">[Consumer Report,</span><span class="font15"> April 1949]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Advocates of the compulsory insurance bill further assert that 325,000 deaths are preventable each year if granted adequate care; .125,000 die from communicable diseases that might, have been cured; 115,000 fall victims to cancer and heart disease that might have been prevented; 30,000 unnecessary maternal and infant deaths occur; 60,000 from other causes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Extreme conditions prevail it the Southern rurals where doctors number only one in 3,000. Senator Humphrey avers that ‘‘only one out of two Southern mothers can afford or receive needed childbirth care”. Result: <sup>4</sup>Tn the low income states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina, the death rate among women in childbirth, for ex-amplej is three times as high as in Com necticut, Minnesota or Rhode Island.” The reason: “The price of medicine in the market place is too high.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even worse than this is the situation in that dismal wasteland assigned to the Na^ajos. In this vast Indian “concentration camp” lying mostly in New Mexico and Arizona, with portions overlapping into Utah and Colorado, .an area of the size of West Virginia (24,000 square miles) live 61,000 Indians. To relieve so much misery “there is only one doctor, one nurse, and one dentist that do any traveling through this reservation!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">It is repeated: the need is generally admitted.

Self-employed persons would also be eligible by paying full in-stMjance premium. The cost will amourit to 1| percent of pay roll up to $4,800 a year. The employer will match this amount with another 1| percent, and unless self-employed the highest cost will be $1.40 per week, which covers not only your own medical bills but those of your dependents as well. The National Health Insurance bill, as it is called, also provides for appropriations and grants-in-aid to the states for public health service, maternal and child health services, services for the aged and chronically ill, industrial hygiene programs, prevention and control of tuberculosis, venereal diseases, mental diseases, cancer and.heart diseases.</span></p>

Besides arguing that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">compulsory insurance alone</span><span class="font13"> will fill the need, which appears to be proved by the fact that when the government experimentally offered indigent Southern families medical care at low rates only 50 percent availed themselves of it, proponents declare that costs will be no greater 4han the present national expense, while much less for low-income families.

<p><span class="font13">In 1946 Americans spent five and 'a half billion for all medical and hospital services, medicines and supplies, health and accident insurance. Proponents believe that billion will cover cost of compulsory insurance, with much better budgeting, distribution, organization and elimination of duplication. The total income of Americans for 1948 was $224,-000,000,000. Four percent of this sum would equal 9 billion. Evfing estimates that all services, including social security and old age pension, will not exceed 12 to 15 percent of pay roll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Dr. Channing Frothingham, twice president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, gave full support to the Compulsory Insurance bill, as chairman of the Committee for the Nation's'Health: “The president's program is a sensible plan to get more and better care to all our people without labeling self-supporting families with the stigma of charity as other proposals, like Senator Taft's, would do.&quot;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Controversy Splits the AMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Last December the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association, during an interim session in St Louis, voted to levy a $25 assessment on each of its 140,000 for the alleged purpose of building a $3,500,000 “war chest&quot; to fight “socialized medicine&quot;. Dr. Morris Fishbein's “dukes were up&quot; against compulsory insurance, reiterating, as editor of. the AMA journal, the oft-repeated cries of “socialism 1 communism! revolution!&quot; The leaders brought around the heavy artillery to blast the bill, but not all was well in the rank and file of AMA membership. Rebellion kindled from a group of eminent members, “the blue book of American medicine,&quot; at first 148, and later swelled to over 200, all objectors, to the assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“If the funds,&quot; reads their indictment, &quot;are to be used for legislative lobbying instead of developing a comprehensive medicai-care program, we are heartily opposed to the levy and refuse to pay it.&quot; They cautioned against the public “suspicion that the association's objectives are primarily economic and selfish&quot;. King's County Medical Society of New York repudiated the levy altogether. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's</span><span class="font13"> further reports: “The New York County Medical Society, .largest county society in AMA [the AMA is made up of 2,011 county medical societies, which in turn are grouped into 53 state and territorial associations}, in three of the most blustery meetings in its history, at first affirmed the assessment, later repudiated it, and finally reaffirmed it. The confusion of hisses, boos and cries of ‘Sit down, Doctor!' made such a battle as staid old Hosaek Hall has rarely seen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During this conflagration Dr. Frothingham added fuel to the fire by charging that AMA's ruling body, the House of Delegates, was not representative of the association's 140,000 members, that the leaders were “pursuing a course unworthy of the medical profession and repugnant to the ethics of Ainencan doctors”; and that the officials were failing “to take the leadership in conjunction with farm, business, labor and consumer organizations to work out a program to bring adequate medical care within reach of all Americans”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Individual doctors continued the defection from AMA, although it was admittedly dangerous business, often endangering hospital appointments. Cooperatives, admittedly victims of the AMA, and colored doctors, excluded by AMA, brought pointed accusations. Another, but not unexpected blow fell from the Physicians Forum, a group of 3,000 members of the AMA, who have long criticized association policies. The forum's chairman, Dr. Ernst P. Boas, from 1938 to 1948 a professor at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, at Columbia University, was directed to wire the chief executive: “Physicians with vision and faith in the future are cheered by your message today [April 22] and heartily endorse your national health program including the proposal for a system of compulsory health insurance which you presented to Congress today. We are confident that, with full access to the facts, the majority of the medical profession will stand behind you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">While pressed by the heat of controversy, the AMA, “true to form/ as one of its leading members expressed it, “is putting its worst foot forward” One very bad move was carried out by a group closely associated with AMA, the National Physicians Committee, “often called the ‘propaganda arm' of the AMA.” A letter denouncing “socialized medicine” was sent to doctors all over the country. As a reprint of “Dan Gilbert's Washington Letter” it was recalled by many that Gilbert was an associate of the notorious Gerald Winrod. Angry response forced the AMA to deny sponsoring the National Physician's Committee “letter”, but quite a lot of the mire stuck on because “on three separate </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 22, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">occasions the AMA House of Delegates </span><span class="font13">officially endorsed and commended the National Physicians Committee's efforts”. One irate doctor wrote in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Rocky Mowntctin Medical Journal:</span><span class="font13"> “If the American Medical Association is to remain great and become greater, it cannot afford the handicap of a triggerman, a goon, or a bodyguard in the guise of the National Physicians Committee” —Dr, William H. Halley, AMA delegate from Colorado.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Charges Against AMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The rift in medical ranks afforded government officials sponsoring the bill opportunity to level other charges. Senator McGrath, Democratic National Committee chairman (newly appointed attorney general), asserted that AMA was. “coercing” its member doctors, and that &quot;the association's own slush fund of $3,500,000 to combat the Fair Deal health program’ was being augmented by another million dollars contributed by drug concerns who support the National Physicians Committee, an antihealth insurance lobby front*.” Corroborating McGrath's charge, In </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Fact</span><span class="font13"> recently focused attention on “29 Patent Medicine, Drug Firms” as “Main Subsidizers of Propaganda Lobby Against Health”. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Miami Life,</span><span class="font13"> Jan. 22,1949) “At leajst six of these firms,” the report adds, “have been cited by the Federal 'Trade Commission for false and misleading advertising, and at least two have been accused by the government of selling packaged drugs dangerous to the public health.” Evidently these firms were &quot;pressured” by AMA because of their vital need for AMA endorsement, and not because they feared lessened sales under the Compulsory Insurance Plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Government officials accused AMA of “negativism, obstructionism, and of do-nothing-ism” ; that “it was a reactionary trade association chiefly interested in doctors making a lot of money”. AMA's charge of “communism” was lightly</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">brushed aside by comparing public schools, social, security, old age insurance, and other tax-supported programs as not endangering liberty. Patients could still choose the doctor and hospital they desired; doctors might enroll or stay out as they saw fit; no coercion would be encountered- The doctors might still earn over $20,000 a year, and suffer no losses through failure to collect. Other arguments of officials include the fact that Britain and Canada like the arrangement, that Norway and Denmark, as well as over thirty-five other coun-tries, have operated successfully under modified forms of public medical care for many years. Said Churchill of the British plan: “Insurance is employing the magic of averages for the benefit of the individual?* </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Lancet,</span><span class="font13"> long established independent British medical publication, appraised: “Both doctor and patient are pleased with their new and easier relationship . . . Patients are also grateful to observe that the new service is truly comprehensive ... Complaints are few?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In all soberness, however, too much may not be expected of socialized medicine. The ills of this world, physical, social, moral, are past human curing. Jehovah's kingdom alone will bring completely comprehensive relief. Further, tax-supported schemes are open to this serious criticism: “The big danger here at home is not outright Communism, but gradual Socialism. Our people oppose the confiscation program of the Communists, ... Americans are not yet aware that they may be socialized by way of crushing taxation, but as thoroughly as by a sudden seizure of power. They may be Socialized, as well, by an ever invading competition of government with private enterprise?'—Pettengill, in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Southern California Rancher,</span><span class="font13"> June, 1949.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Blood Transfusion Scriptural?</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">M</span><span class="font13">ANY people today think that blood transfusion in medical practice is a recent innovation. But not so! It is ।____-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">sands of years old. Did it originate with God? Was it a feature of the Theocratic organization of Jehovah and according to His law given through Moses to the Israelites? This question may arise, in view of the International News Service dispatch from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, dated July 11, 1948:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“A cargo of 13,000 pounds of blood plasma and medical supplies for the infant State of Israel will be flown to the Holy Land tomorrow from Philadelphia. . . . Included in the cargo are 1,000 pounds of'plasma, 2,000 blood transfusion sets, 10,000 units of gas gangrene anti-toxin and 216,000 hypodermic needles. The shipment was prepared by American representatives of the Bed Star of David, Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The practice of blood transfusion, however, did not originate with God’s organization, and for very fundamental reasons not. It originated with the enemies of Israel and of God. Concerning this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font13"> re-vised edition of 1929, says on page 113^ column one, of Volume 4, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Transfusion of blood dates as far back as the time of the ancient Egyptians. The earliest reported case is that practiced on Pope Innocent VIII in 1492, The operation cost the lives of three youths and the. Pontiffs life was not saved. Great strides in the research and practice of transfusion on animals were</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 22, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">made after Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of blood in the middle of the 17th century. Physicians in Germany, England and France were ^specially active in the work of blood transfusion after this discovery. They reasoned that as the blood is the principal medium by which the body is nourished, transfusion, therefore, is a quicker and shorter road to feed an ill-nourished body than eating food which turns to blood after several changes. So transfusion was thought of not only as a cure, but also as a rejuve-nator. Attempts were then made to cure various diseases, such as fevers, leprosy, insanity and hydrophobia. .Lamb’s blood was used for transfusions into human beings with varying success. Curious to relate, the Faculty of Medicine of Paris refused to recognize Harvey’s discovery and also opposed any progress made in the art of transfusion. They persecuted those who were active in the research work of transfusion. It was in the end of thfi 18th and in the beginning of the 19th eentuiy that the most active work in establishing transfusion as a surgical procedure after haemorrhage was done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Shall we now .say that those three youths, whose lives it cost to provide the-unsuccessful blood transfusion for Pope Innocent VIII in 1492, fulfilled Jesus’ command: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends”? (John 15:13) This must be countered with the question, Is it right to break the strict commandment of God in order to try to provide life for another! Is breaking God’s commandment love of God, even if it is done while trying to preserve one’s own and another</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">person's present life a little longer! (1 John 5:3) Of course, to a pope it means nothing unscriptural to take directly into his system the blood of three, youths, especially when the pope claims by the repeating of the words at mass, &quot;Hie est sanguis mens,&quot; to transform the wine into the literal blood of Jesus Christ and then claims to drink such literal blood. Blood is blood to a pope, be it that of Jesus Christ or of other human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the medical men used lamb's blood for transfusions into hurtian blood streams, they disregarded God’s law to Moses forbidding the mixing of the blood of different species of animal life, namely: “Keep these rules of mine: Never let any of your cattle breed with a different kind; never sow two kinds of seed in your fields; never don a robe made of two different kinds of cloth. You shall not eat any meat with the blood in it.” (Leviticus 19:19,26, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font13"> When they poured the shed blood of the lambs, not onto the ground, but into human blood-vessels, they further despised the import of the same Mosaic law: &quot;If anyone belonging to Israel or any alien who has settled . among them captures by hunting any beast or bird that may be ^aten, he must pour its blood out, covering it with dust; for the soul of every creature is bound up with its blood. Hence my order for Israel is, that you must never taste the blood of any creature, for the soul of every creature lies in its blood; anyone who tastes it shall be outlawed.”—Leviticus 17:13,14, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The law of Moses was given after the Israelites left Egypt, and so when the ancient Egyptians practiced blood transfusion, were they altogether excusable! No; for the law of God which bears upon the subject was given before ever Mis-raim was born to Noah’s son Ham and became the father of the Egyptians. When Noah, Ham and the other six emerged from the ark after the flood, Jehovah God established an everlasting covenant with them that extends to all their descendants to this day, and that covenant insists on the sanctity of human as well as other animal blood, God said to.them: “Only, you must never eat flesh with the life (that is, the blood) in it. And I will avenge the shedding of your own lifeblood; I will avenge it on any beast, I will avenge man's life on man, upon his brother-man; whoever sheds human blood, by human hands shall his own blood be shed—for God made man in hfs own likeness.&quot; (Genesis 9:4-6; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font13"> Of course, the flesh of animal creatures might be eaten to sustain life and without violating the sacredness of the life which is in the blood. Yet. if the blood was eaten or drunk in conjunction with the flesh, then the one partaking of the blood was judged by God </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to be guilty of wanton slaying of the </span><span class="font13">life of such creatures and was a breaker of the covenant God's regulation clearly showed that one's partaking oK the blood was not necessary to sustain human life and that it was not in the same classification as the partaking of flesh as food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It cannot be said that such regulation applies to the blood of animals lower than man but not to human blood. If the blood of lower animals was considered so precious, it representing life from the Creator, then certainly the blood of the higher creature, man, was to be rated as not less precious. For that reason, if an animal killed a man, the blood of such human life taken was required of the killer beast; it must be killed. This decree therefore brands as criminal the heathen practice according to which bloodthirsty warriors, after killing a mighty man of their enemies, would drink his blood in the belief that by absorbing such blood they would at the same time appropriate the mighty qualities of the slain one. Among the bar bar-: ous and fierce, savage nations of old, such as the Scythians, Tartars, desert Arabs, Scandinavians, etc., who lived mostly on animal bloody there tvere some even who drank the blood of their foes after making cups of their skulls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The everlasting covenant as to the sanctity of creature blood carries beyond the abolition of the Mosaic law covenant Years after Jesus’ death His disciples had a conference concerning Gentile Christians. Then the disciple James said: “My sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols, .and from fornication, arid from things strangled, and from blood?' Then that conference of apostles and elder disciples framed a letter. Besides telling the Gentiles they were not under the Mosaic law covenant, they inserted this: “For it seemed good to the holy [spirit}, and to us, to lay upon you nu greater burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled [not drained of their blood at slaughter], and from fornication?' (Acts 15: 6-29) That the Christians stuck to that decision for years afterward is evident from the account at Acts 21:25. Christians to this day are letting that decision influence them in their decisions respecting medical bloodtransfusions. They do not view such transfusions as acceptable sacrifices made supposedly for the lives of others, but remember King David's words in his prophecy of Christ: “Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offdr.”—Psalm 16:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font13">HE Returned Services Association in New Zealand is supposed to be the nonpolitical and nonsectarian organization of returned servicemen. There is no doubt that many truly patriotic men are in that organization. However, there is a danger present of its members' sleepily allowing a few totalitarian-minded ones to act and speak for them in the guise of patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Last year the R.S.A, got itself into trouble by slandering a schoolteacher in Taranaki, claiming that she was “ousted” from her job as a schoolteacher through the instigation of the R.S.A. and because she was one of Jehovah's witnesses. But they had their wires crossed. This teacher, a housewife not in need of a job, was asked to teach on a temporary basis by members of the education board. As a favor, this teacher agreed. When she finished her teaching assignment, the R.S.A., seeking to discredit her personally and the organization of Jehovah's witnesses, printed the slanderous accusation in their official paper</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Review” that she had been “ousted”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This brazen lie backfired when they heard that they were going to be shed for slander. The result was that they were forced to publicly apologize to the teacher, not only in their own paper, but also in the public press, as well as pay out a sum of money for damages, in order to have the suit called off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Now, recently, pseudopatriotic members of the R.S.A. stoop to try to muzzle free speech and worship and to try to break up Christian meetings. This latest occurrence took place on June 5 in Tau-rtinga. That week-end Jehovah's witnesses were having their semiannual circuit assembly in Tauranga, to be climaxed on Sunday by the public Bible talk “The Government of Peace”, which would be given in the Town Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Around 2:30 p.m. the mob began K gather up the street from the Town Hal], under a shop veranda, close to sixty of them. And, just before three o'clock, when the talk was due to begin, they marched in and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But it appeared that there rfas </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">n </span><span class="font13">split in the ranks of the R.SjV. members, Some observers advanced the onin-ion that apparently the older non-Cath-olic men were trying to restrain the younger ones from causing trouble. At any rate, the Catholic element separated from the larger group and sat on the right-hand side of the hall. The others sat together on the opposite side and, let it be said, remained quiet throughout the discourse, many of them paying close 'attention. The later disturbances originated with the Catholic element on the right To handle any riotous conduct, enough ushers were on hand, and a number of these stood near the mobsters to keep an eye on them. This was, of course, an unexpected development for the mobsters. They did not know whether to view the Witnesses as pacifists or not</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was time to begin and the chairman introduced the speaker, who proceeded to deliver the speech “The Government of Peace &quot;. The entire talk was given without serious interruption, despite heckling from the Catholic Action section. As the cnairman started to make his closing announcements, yells from them demanded that the speaker answer questions, The chairman pointed out that such was not part of the program, and he dismissed the meeting. He and the speaker walked off the stage. This turn of events was too much for the Catholics of the mob, who stirred the mob to stard and sing the national anthem, “God Sa ze the King/’ but the rest in attendance ignored them and their childish antics. (About 250 people were in attendance.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But the ringleaders were still bitter about their failure. During the week after the talk, the chairman of the public address, C. D. Keogh an, lost his job. His boss succumbed to pressure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">White Paper on China</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">$ The steady advance of the Communists across China continued to pose a major problem for the U. S. in July and August. Costly aid to China had been of no avail and it looked as if it had all gone down the drain. A Republican-led section of Congress hotly criticized the Administration, charging (1) that the U. 8. had sold out China at Yalta; (2) that U.S. aid to the Nationalists had been insufficient; (3) that the U.S. had failed to give military guidance to Nationalist forces, and (4) that in spite of Nationalist reverses the U. S.^had followed a do-noth-Ing policy. The release of the White Paper on China (August 5) raised a storm of Congressional criticism. It was called an “alibi” intended to Cover up the government's ineptitude. The White Paper, a book comprising 400 pages of narrative, 600 pages of documentation, and a 15-page statement by the U. S’, secretary of state, Dean Acheson, traces U.S.-Chlnese relations over a hundred years, stressing the last five years. It charged that U. S. aid to China ($3,000,000,000) had been wasted because of corruption and graft in the Nationalist regime. Mr. Acheson In.his foreword warned Chinese Communists to keep hands off the remainder of Asia, saying the U. S. should encourage “all developments in China” which tended toward “throwing off the foreign [Communist] yoke’*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Military Assistance Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; In world affairs the everdeveloping pattern (If the mess things are in can be said to have a pattern) was decidedly martial </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">tone at the beginning of August. Talk of war and war preparation continued to fllhg a mantle of gloom over all efforts to extricate the nations out of the postwar debacle. While the Unit-; ed Nations continued to mark time, the Atlantic Defense Pact made more tangible progress as ratification by member nations took place. Tn the U. S. Congress discussions of arms aid under the Military Assistance Program (MAP) progressed steadily enough, but it was evident that the $1,450,000,000 arms bill would have tough sledding. Top foreign policy spokesmen wanted to hold the program to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">modest “Interim” basis until a co-operative defense plan could be properly drawn up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gen. Omar Bradley, U. S. Army chief of staff, revealed the general outlines of a master defense plan that would come Into effect In case of aggression. It provided for strategic bombing of the attacker and for use of the atom bomb by the U. S. Britain, France and nations nearer the scene of action would be assigned short-range attack bombardment and air defense. Keeping the sea-lanes clear and conducting essential naval operations would be handled by the U. S. navy and Western European union powers, while ground defense would come from other European nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Secretary of State Acheson testified the program was necessary because Russia hes built up, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font10">said, “the greatest combination of military forces” ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Said Henry Wallace, “when we are taxed presumably to stop Russia and Communism by shipping arms to other nations we open the door to the real aggressors against all people everywhere—waste, depression, hatred and finally that supreme waste, the frustration of unemployment, the rotting away of men and resources unused.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Chiefs of Staff</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; During the first week of August the U. S. chiefs of staff, Gen. Omar N. Bradley of the army, Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg of the air force and Admiral Louis E. Denfeld of the navy, discussed military problems involved in the defense of Western Europe. They stopped at Frankfort, London and Paris and visited also other parts of^fcurope, They consulted with the military leaders of the Atlantic Pact nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Smearing U. N. Staff</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">^VThe U. S., which was so anxious to have the U. N. headquarters located fn its territory, was being embarrassed in July </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">investigations on the part </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">Congressional committees. The Immigration Subcommittee went so far as to release a bitter attack on the secretary general Of the U. N. by an anonymous witness, as well as to suspect other U. N. personnel. The U. N., by acting secretary Byron </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Price, </span><span class="font10">protested to the U. S. secretary of state, Dean Acheson, who replied that freedom of expression in the U. S. permitted even the publication of such attacks, which he discounted, however, as not to be taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Council of Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; Delegates of ten Western European nations met in the city </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Strasbourg August 7 and elected Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium president of the consultative assembly, the Council of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">German Elections</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people of Western Germany for the first rime since Hit</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ler </span><span class="font10">came into power had opportunity to choose their own government In the elections of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">august 15. </span><span class="font10">They rejected both Com</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">munism </span><span class="font10">and Socialism and, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">endorsing </span><span class="font10">the new republic, chose </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a rightist regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ha Loan io Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">+ The Senate oh Avgust 4 voted 55 to 86 to bar Spain from receiving $60,000,000 in Marshall Finn recovery loans, upholding a decision by Vice-President Barkley that the proposal was out of order because Spain la not In the Sphere of the ECA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy and the Pact</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">4&gt; </span><span class="font10">While Communists in Parliament argued against Italy’s joining the Atlantic Paet, two truckloads of petitions bearing 7,000,000 objectors* signatures were unloaded at the Parliament building, Mean whhe Russia seat notes saying that joining the pact do-latefi the peace treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The vote taken by the Chamber ratified the pact 323 to 100. The Italian Senate approved the pact (July 80) 175-81.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tugoelwvta va. Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">$ The propaganda battle between Yugoslavia and the Kremlin centered around the arrest by Tito’s government of certain Russians In late July. The Kremlin charged Yugoslavia with illegally holding these Russians and demanded their release. Tito replied hi forceful terms that these men were assassins who bad fieri from Russia In the first place, and that they had engaged in subversive activity in Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Balkans</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font10">Greek government troops were reported to be meeting with success as they stepped up a drive against the guerrillas Id early August. Albania protested that Greek troops had invaded her territory. Greek troops elsewhere were pushing guerrillas Into a trap from which they could not escape Into Yugoslavia (If Ttto kept his word not to assist them). Tito in a speech to 350,000 Macedonians (August 8) asserted that the time would come when the pro-Comlnform governments of Bulgaria and Albania would be overthrown. He said be would help them in case of a revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Rumania vs. Catholic Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; Rumania’s Communist-led government on August 1 gave Roman Catholic orders in the country until August 15 to wind up their affairs. An official announcement said monks and duds were not needed for so-called welfare work as the state took care of these things. Monks and nuns received two weeks to decide on (1) retiring to three cloisters and two monasteries set aside for them, (2) entering old age homes, or (3) registering for regular jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Syrian Coup d’Etat</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">4&gt; </span><span class="font10">In eariy August the Syrian Cabinet was drafting a new constitution under which Islam (Mohammedanism) would no longer be the state rellgkm. Then, August 14, for the second time in lees than five months Syria had a new government. As the result of a military coup President Husnl Zayim and Premier Mohsen el Barazl were arrested, court-martialed and executed. The new government quickly issued an announcement that the whole count-try was normal and calm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Israel and the Refugees</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&amp; Israel, which Is having difficulty In absorbing the great numbers of Immigrants that continue to arrive in Palestine, in the first part of August offered to take hack 100/100 of the 600,000 Arab refugees who had been driven from their Palestine homes in Jewish-Arab fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">No Peace in Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Claims of peace in Palestine and settlement of the Arab-Israeli differences were denied In early August by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Khalil Totan? </span><span class="font10">the executive director of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the in</span><span class="font10">stitute of Arab-American </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Affairs, </span><span class="font10">He said: “In the face of Jewish aggression the Arabs have beguii to arm.

<p><span class="font10">It to oppose the raiding of the public treasury for private religious ends is antl-Catholle, then the majority of Americans are ant I-Catholic. They found a spokesman in Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, who expressed herself candidly and impartially as to not favoring federal aid to private, parochial and religious education. She provoked the ire of Cardinal Spellman, who did not scruple to stoop to innuendo In seeking to defame the former first lady, She answered with dignity and poise, to the delight of millions of freedom-loving Americans, courageously main' tabling her position and asserting her right to freedom of speech on all public questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Naive Belief</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;£&gt; Truman, speaking at a reception given by Jacob Arvey, Democratic county chairman, at Chicago, said he knew of a meeting between the pope and the president of the N. Y. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> and that the latter had said he could assure the pope that Mr, Truman would not be in the White House after January. Said the newspaper executive later, ‘T have always assumed that a conversation with the pope was as confidential as one that might be had with the president of the United States, and I shall continue to adhere to tpy naive beliefs.” The Time* president can' console himself with the thought that this is not the first time a pope has made fools of some of the more reputable of America's prominent men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Five-Percenters”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; Home freezer units and the president’s wife were prominently mentioned In the Investigation of “five-percenters” in early August. Major general Harry Vaughan, President Truman’s military aide, assumed full re* aponslblllty for the gifts of home food freezers to Mrs. Truman and high government officials. But he had some difficulty in explaining matters. “Five-percenters&quot; are those who assign government contracts on consideration of a proportionate donation to their personal pocketbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">War Contract Frauds</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lindsay U- Warren, controller general of the U. S., charged in a report to Congress (August 4) that more than $11,500,000 had been overpaid to government war contractors through fraud and waste.

<p><span class="font10">&lt;$&gt; Norris H. Dodd, director general of the U. N. Food and Agricultural Organization, said (July 19) that he was enthusiastic for what “just a little money and just a little brains&quot; can accomplish in improving the miserable lot of hundreds of millions of people living on Dear-starvation diets. He indicated that about ail some diplomatic big shots know about the problem is that they are sure “hundreds of millions of dollars are needed&quot;. He asserted - “What people need to realize Is that you don’t start with vast, expensive projects of mechanization. If we could bring half the world from the era of the sickle to the era of scythe, we would have moved ahead a hundred years In one jump/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Unemployment In the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a world where there is so much to be done unemployment Indicates that there Is a dog in the manger somewhere. In early August unemployment in the U. S. passed the four-million mark, the highest figure since 1942. Total civilian employment continued to be close to sixty million: agricultural 9,647,000 and non-agricultural 50,073,000.</span></p>

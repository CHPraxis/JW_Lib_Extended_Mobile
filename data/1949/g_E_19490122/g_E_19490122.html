<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Quebec City, Bring Forth Your Witnesses!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">J</span><span class="font13">EHOVAH is a God of trath, but He does not fear error. What is the chaff to the wheat? Will not fiery Bible truth consume the ehaff? And what is the rock to the hammer? When the hammer of truth cracks down on stumbling-stones, will they </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> crumble away? The hailstones of truth will sweep away the refuge of lies. There are no hidden errors that will not be exposed, no dark deeds that light will not make manifest Hence Jehovah God fearlessly ‘ says, Let the false priests and prophets go ahead and prophesy, and let those that have My word speak My word faithfully.—Jeremiah 23:25-29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So be it Jehovah’s witnesses know that organized religion teaches doctrine that is rooted in human tradition and paganism, that conflicts with the Bible, that blinds eyes and deafens ears to truth, and that by blacking out these windows to the mind organized religion has left the people in the dark as to God’s Word. Nevertheless, God says to let them babble their blasphemies, for His truth like a hammer will powder them, and His Word like a fire will burn them to ashes. Christ Jesus said it is the workers of evil that love darkness and hate light. (John 3:19-21) Hence Jehovah's witnesses seek to suppress no speaker, but let all word and doctrine stand or fall in the purging fires of public discussion. They abide by Jehovah’s decree of free speech, as stated at Isaiah 43:8-12:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>f&lt;</sup>Bring forth the people that are blind, yet have eyes, and are deaf, yet have ears! All the nations are gathered to-gether<sub>v</sub>and the peoples are assembled; yet who among them could foretell this, could announce it to us beforehand? Let them bring their witnesses to prove them in the right, to hear their plea, and say, Tt is true? ” </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">[An American Translation) </span><span class="font13">After thus inviting error to produce its witnesses, Jehovah God calls notice </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font13">the ones He will put on the stand to represent Him t “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah ; and besides me there is no saviour. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God?’—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Such free speech is practical. In these turbulent day£ when truth and error spring like grass side by side, how is a separation to be made except by scrutiny of both I Truth need have no fear; only error need tremble and oppose the examination. Only error does. Posing in the garb of truth, frightened error screams that truth is false and should be denied freedom to circulate, should be suppressed. Error does not wish to fering forth its witnesses; not when they must face cross-examination by truth. Generally, organized religion does not want to do it. Particularly, the Boman Catholic Hierarchy does not want to do it. More specifically, Catholicism in Quebec City does not wish to do it. But she did. She maneuvered herself into that embarrassment. Here is how it happened.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>No Freedom of Worship in Quebec City</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Quebec City is overwhelmingly Catholic. Though in lands where the Catholic Church is a minority she of necessity tolerates freedom of worship, in areas where she is a powerful majority she casts aside this galling toleration of freedom. Hence at her hands the small group of Jehovah’s witnesses in Quebec City has suffered much persecution and imprisonment. One instrument of suppression has been a 'piece of mischief framed by law’, a by-law that prohibits circulation of printed matter without police permission. (Psalm 94; 20) This law allows the police chief to censor literature or forbid its distribution, though it merely he Bible instruction. Now one of Jehovah’s witnesses, Damase .Daviau, has challenged this ordinance on the ground that it contravenes freedom of speech and religion, and is seeking a permanent-injunction against the city to prevent the city authorities from interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses’ freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The case of Daviau against the City of Quebec and the Province of Quebec was called for trial before the Superior Court in Quebec City on November la, 1948, before Justice Leon Casgrain. Attorney for Daviau was Sam S. Bard, but the vice-president of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Ine., and legal counsel for the Society, Hayden C. Covington, was present to direct court tactics. Mr. Covington took the stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For half a day he gave testimony under direct examination. He outlined the history and structure of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses, the methods employed by them in training and preparing themselves as ministers, their ordination, their methods of preaching and reasons therefor, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font13"> missionary nature of the Society. Thence he summarized the outstanding doctrines taught by Jehovah’s witnesses, climaxing with the most important one, the kingdom of God. The more recent literature of the Society was introduced in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then began cross-examination, conducted by the city attorney for Quebec City, Ernest Godbout. He was assisted by the solicitor general, Noel Dorion, the chief counsel in the courts of the province for Attorney General Duplessis. It was evident that the city attorney, with the aid of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic priest, had</span><span class="font13"> carefully examined the doctrines and books of Jehovah’s witnesses. He was not content to stop with the resume given M Mr. Covington on direct examination. He introduced in evidence many additional publications of the Society, among which was that little leaflet that has gen erated so much heat in Quebec, entitlec “Quebec’s Burning Hate for God am Christ and Freedom”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Organized Religion Exposed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Early in cross-examination the cit attorney waded </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">into the controversy </span><span class="font13">doctrines. He produced the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ene mies.</span><span class="font13"> Did Mr. Covington agree with it identification of the Roman Catholi Hierarchy as a part of the whore o Revelation? Yes; the Bible uses wome to symbolize organizations. The Catholi Church has relations with this world, i entangled in fEs wars and politics an commerce, is therefore guilty of spiri ual adultery, according to Janies 4:4 hence is fittingly embraced in the syn holism of a whore. Even Webster’s m abridged dictionary lists the Roma Cathoiic Church as one of the definitioi of “whore”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do you think it right to circulate sue doctrine in a province where the peop are 95 percent to 100 percent Cathoiu Yes, the witness thought so. Bible tru' affects the life prospects of all men, its presentation is most vital. If the Roman Catholic Church told the truth she would not object to having her teachings meet the test of discussion. Emphasis was placed on the fact that these adverse judgments of Catholicism were God’s Judgments, that Jehovah’s witnesses only declared them in obedience to His command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The cross-examination bore down relentlessly with its contention that Jehovah’s witnesses were not a religious organization, hence freedom of worship was not here involved. The witness shelved the Bible distinction between religious formalism and Christianity. The Jews were warned about religion; Jesus denounced the religious scribes and Pharisees, their ceremony and tradition that voided God’s Word (Matthew 15:1-9; chapter 23); Paul said other religionists worshiped the demons. Today organized religion has been, snared by ceremony, formalism, lip-service and traditions that conflict with the Bible.- ■ Still, when legislation speaks of religion and religious liberty it is not concerning itself with distinctions within that broad field, and certainly it does not mean to exclude Christianity. It is guaranteeing freedom for all inodes of worship. The Scriptures draw<sup>1</sup> finer lines of definition on religion and Christianity than do dictionaries and laws. Within the legal meaning of the term &quot;religion” comes the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Since you say the Devil is the ruler of this present world, do you think this court is of the Devil? That does not necessarily follow. When men have laws that are in harmony with God’s law, or do not conflict with God’s law, they should be obeyed; and'courts that seek to insure justice according to these laws serve a good purpose. Jesus said to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. Obeying worldly laws that preserve order and provide for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">necessary oversight to prevent anarchy </span><span class="font13">is a part of rendering to Caesar that which is his; but when laws of men would prevent us from rendering unto God that which is His, then we must follow the apostles’ decision: &quot;We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 5:29; 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Quebec's &quot;Boly Trinity&quot; of Experts</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'Space forbids further recounting of the cross-examination, but it took a full day to complete. After Witness Duncombe testified on the local organization in Quebec City and Witness Daviau told of his ministerial activity in that territory, Mr. Godbont began the city’s defense. It was reported that the city’s attorney had spent about $3,000 of the city’s money in getting into book form &quot;expert evidence” from a &quot;trinity” of clergymen, Catholic, Protestant and Jew, that became as one to expose Jehovah’s witnesses. But the work and money went down the drain when the judge would not admit the book as evidence. These &quot;expert witnesses” sought to inject their error into the court record by means of this book, and thereby escape any embarrassing cross-examination. Quebec did not wish to have to bring them forth as witnesses, but the judge’s action of not admitting the book forced the city’s hand. But even admitting them as &quot;expert witnesses” was illegal, for such prejudiced clergymen -had no right on the stand to judge Jehovah’s witnesses and babble their opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">First &quot;expert” on the stand was &quot;Father” Herve Gagne, French Catholic priest. He condemned the Witnesses, outlawed them, found them beyond the commonly accepted definition of religion, said that preaching from door to door or in homes was not an act of religion, nor was distribution of printed sermons or preaching from a pulpit. He was effeminate in his attitude, insulted oyer the pictures in the Society’s publications, and when given free rein &quot;took off</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">fajtq the stratosphere” of philosophy and prattled about &quot;inner man” and &quot;outer man”, “inner religion” and “external religion”, and after one such &quot;take-off” flew on for forty-five minutes into these flimsy abstractions till even those who understood French could not understand him. Judge and lawyers looked blank, and finally' the judge mercifully ended the flight by asking the city attorney to ask another question. He showed abysmal ignorance of the Bible, said he could not discuss the Bible since he was only a priest and not of the Hierarchy of the Catholic Church. But he did contend that a Christian should comply with all laws of the land, even those that conflicted with God's law. What would the &quot;Father” do if the civil law forbade the celebration of mass? That was the question under which he squirmed when </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">court</span><span class="font13"> adjournment, for the day rescued him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Rabbi” and Unprotesting &quot;Protestant</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The completion of the testimony of the Catholic priest did not resume the nqxt day, but in his stead the city put on its next member of the “trinity” of “experts”, a Jesuit-trained “Rabbi”. He loved everyone, all religions, and would criticize none. He unctiously swayed and dipped his corpulent body in the witness box, playing as much to the spectators as for the judge. He did say freedom of religion stopped when it was used to criticize other religions. Then on crossexamination he got all fouled up. He could not criticize the Witnesses because he did think they were religious, and he had said he would not criticize anyone because of his religion. He admitted Jehovah's witnesses were religious and their books religious. He had to read scriptures from the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel wherein they criticized and condemned religious practices. When he finished he backed and scraped his way out of the courtroom, and that was the last seen of “Rabbi” Solomon Frank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After the “extinguished” rabbi came the “Very Reverend” Kenneth Fvaris, loaded down with high-sounding titles and docility, at first. He said Jehovah's witnesses were religious and had a right to do the work they were doing, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">on </span><span class="font13">the fifteen or twenty questions put to him did not hurt the Witnesses' case bub only impeached the priest and rabbi in everything they had said to hurt the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But upon his return to the stand the next morning he showed evidences of being diligently coached to be a better witness for the city. He condemned the Witnesses, specially the doctrines exposing the Catholic Church and the leaflet </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Quebec's Burning Hate.</span><span class="font13"> He did not even want to look at the literature, and his excitement reached such a pitch that he was suddenly asked if merely reading the literature would incite him to do violence. Throwing his hysteria into reverse he replied slowly and quietly, “Why, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font13">am a very mild and peaceful man,” But the affectation was so obvious the entire courtroom burst into laughter, including judge and lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before he got off the stand this Anglican had to read Jesus' scathing denunciation of religious hypocrisy, at Matthew 23, and Isaiah 56:10,11, where religious clergy are called “dumb dogs”. He did not object to that language by Jesus and Isaiah,* hence if the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">contents </span><span class="font13">of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Quebec's Burning Hate</span><span class="font13"> were true would he object to it.1 Only a threat of holding him for contempt of court made him answer, that assuming the contents to be true it was proper to print and distribute it. He was glad to leave the stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Catholic priest resumed the testimony previously interrupted. He still had to answer what he would do when the civil authorities forbade mass. Would he obey worldly authority or do God's service as he saw it? He refused to answer. A motion for contempt of court was made, with an alternative motion that he be forced to answer. The judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ruled he should answer. The priest said </span><span class="font13">the Church would not oblige him to say mass in defiance; of civil authority. But the biggest snare for this philosophywise, Bible-ignorant priest was his claim that the Catholic priest was mediator between God and man. When he was confronted with the Bible text, “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,” he had to admit the priest was not the mediator. (1 Timothy 2:5) At this point the case was adjourned until January 24, 1949.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Some of the Public Response</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Quebec brought forth its witnesses, “experts,” no less. But these witnesses brought forth could not provfe Quebec City in the right, could not make the listening persons in the courtroom say, “It is true.&quot; After hearing the Lord’s witnesses that He had there to testify, many thought they were proved right The case started in a small courtroom, but ended in the largest one, with never nfore than standing room. The newspapers of Quebec City gave the trial much space. Incidentally, one newspaper clipping from New York that proved a conspiracy between the police and the Catholic priest was received in evidence. Regardless of the outcome of the case, the Lord has used it to give a tremendous testimony to His name and people in Quebec City. It attracted public notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Feel with us the public pulse as it beat at the trial. One of Jehovah's witnesses got in a taxicab and remarked, “I’ve been attending the trial this morning.” Forthwith the driver pulled over to the curb, switched off his motor, and parked for an hour and a half while the Witness explained the truth. Another taxi driver attended the trial, and remarked afterward: “I’m going to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In court, after Mr, Covington had finished his testimony, a court attache came over quickly and whispered: “You have told us things we have never heard </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">JANUARY 22,1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in our life, and we are glad to hear them. You have more friends here than you realize,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During the trial the Catholic bishop came in and sat among his French parishioners. He saw one Frenchman write on a piece of paper, “What is religion?” and another in answer merely write, This bishop saw in the courtroom two little girls who were related to some friends of his. He asked them, “What have you come here for, to be converted?” Their short reply was, 'Wes; we have and we are,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A stranger walked up to a graduate of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead while in the courthouse and invited the Witness to his home. Ten Catholics were there. The priest came in the middle of the Bible discussion. The Witness and the priest discussed the Scriptures, and after several hours of discussion and much embarrassment for the priest when he could not Scripturally answer, the priest asserted, “Well, the Catholic Church is the preserver and interpreter of the Bible.” Thereupon the householder who arranged for the meeting turned on him, “When have you ever taught us the Bible!” He asked the others present, “Has he taught you?” All present answered No; and the priest retreated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Quebec City has taken fresh courage, and boldly witnesses now. They had many Bible studies going in and around the courthouse during the trial. They have many new back-calls in their file to be cared for. One afternoon a crowd of strangers were arguing outside the courthouse, vehemently. The question was whether or not the Catholic Hierarchy was the whore of Revelation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the trial in Quebec City is resumed on January </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font13"> and “Father” Gagne again takes the witness stand, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> will have a correspondent there to give a report to its readers. Perhaps by then “Father” Gagne will have read the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Dispensing justice is a complicated process today. Ask any lawyer as lie wades through the hundreds of law books that stand as paper bricks of his library walls. But a thousand years ago justice was simple, and by simple we mean foolish, silly, senseless. And cruel. Trial was by ordeal. For instance, there was the <sup>t</sup>'ordeal of the cross*'. The accused and accuser were stood before a cross and told to stand still. The first to move his feet or fall over was guilty of lying. In another ordeal bread blessed by a priest was given along with cheese tb the accused. He was ordered to eat both quickly. If he choked on it as he tried to swallow, he was </span><span class="font11">guilty. </span><span class="font9">Then there was the test where a stone was placed in boiling water. The prisoner plunged his </span><span class="font11">I are </span><span class="font9">hand in and snatched up the stone. If his hand was Raided, he was guilty. </span><span class="font11">There were many other </span><span class="font9">trials by ordeal, such as carrying a piece of red-hot iron in the hand </span><span class="font11">for * distance of several </span><span class="font9">feet.

<p><span class="font19">O</span><span class="font13">FTEN the great political situations . of the world have their echoes in minor situations throughout the earth. That is the case with what occurred this past June in Mexico city. The incident has to do with people that have little love for each other, the.Communists and the Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It all started out very inconspicuously in a new hotel, Hotel del Prado, claimed to be one of the most beautiful in the world, with hundreds of spacious rooms, large dining room, swimming pool, theater, stores, all within the hotel. They claim that the hotel is so complete that a person could live there without ever leaving it. Hotel del Prado is built on the wide and beautiful Avenida Juarez, facing the park, La Alameda Central. Without a doubt,' the hotel was built to attract the thousands of American tourists that yearly pour into Mexico a gold mine of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">About four years ago the construction of the building was started, and shortly afterward the architect and director of the project, Carlos Obregon Santaeilia, solicited the services of the world-famous Mexican muralist, Diego Rivera, the Communist millionaire, to paint a large mural in the spacious dining room. Rivera, the 62-year-old artist born in Guanajuato, Mexico, “early in his career . . . became a Communist,” according to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">World Book Encyclopedia.</span><span class="font13"> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">En~</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* cyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> continues by saying that his favorite subjects are </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r A</span><span class="font13"> revolutionary and labor ques-I tions. And his last mural in</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hotel del Prado practically <sup>canse</sup>d a minor revolution in vL/ Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Rivera, when first contracted to do the job, made a small ^4 drawing of the mural he was to k paint in the new hotel. It was to be a scene of the park La Ala-\ meda Central, across from the hotel, showing a water fountain and a number of men and women of the nineteenth century walking through the park. About a year ago Diego Rivera started his project, and it was not long before people started to notice that his work was not just a general park scene, but a mural showing Benito Juarez, Cortes, Ignacio Ramirez and other people famous in Mexican history, mixed in with some fruit peddlers, a^few witches and a pickpocket. Juarez has in his hands a copy of the Mexican Constitution while standing in front of him is the famous Mexican teacher and writer of the nineteenth century, Ignacio Ramirez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Ignacio'Ramirez, also born in Guanajuato, Mexico, was as much a radical in his day as Diego Rivera is at the present time. Ramirez, known as the “Necromancer” in the literary world, is also represented in the mural as holding a script in his hands-which contains the sentence legible to all that caused such an uproar a few months ago in Catholic Mexico. The sentence reads, “God does not exist.” Ramirez himself first wrote the sentence in his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Luis Osio, the manager of the hotel, noted the sentence in Rivera's mural and, realizing that it might cause trouble, asked Rivera to remove the historical quotation, Osio probably remembered the trouble Rivera caused a few years ago with one of his murals in</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Hotel Reforma. Rivera promised to remove it. But he never did keep his promise-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Enter the Archbishop</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Then, as is the custom in the Catholic world of blessing bridges (remember Pacelli, now pope Pius XII, blessed the Oakland-Bay Bridge at its inauguration), wars, buildings, and any other object, the directors of the hotel asked the archbishop of Mexico, Luis B. Martinez, to bless the. new hotel. The archbishop readily accepted the offer. In touring the large hotel he noted in the dining room Rivera's mural and the disturbing words of the “Necromancer”, “God does not exist.” The archbishop stopped there and then and stated that he “could npt bless a building which contained a phrase denying the existence of God”. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{El Universal;</span><span class="font13"> June 2, 1948)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This exploded in Mexico the incident which ended up in a Catholic newspaper attack against the Communists, In two days every newspaper and radio station in Mexico were blasting out their hate against Rivera and the Communist party he belongs to, the PP, or Partido Popular (Popular Party). Some of the headlines were quite interesting. One reads: &quot;All the Catholic World Against the ‘Monkey PainteP.” </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(La Prensa,</span><span class="font13"> June 3, 1948)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The fight continues, Rivera refuses to erase the disturbing statement, and the archbishop refuses to bless the hotel as long as Rivera’s mural contains the disputed sentence. Later Rivera proposed a solution to the problem to the managers of the Hotel del Prado. Hig solution is that Archbishop Martinez bless the building with the exception of the disputed mural, upon the which, says Rivera, he could put a cursing. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(La Prensa<sub>t </sub></span><span class="font13">June 2,1948)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the subject of Hotel del Prado was causing more excitement in Mexico than all the trouble in Europe. Then in a number of cities throughout Mexico appeared the sentence, “God does exist/* written on the walls of homes and bund ings. On June 3 </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La Prensa</span><span class="font13"> carried statements of the public in general concerning the topic, and one says, “If it were in my power to punish Biego Rivera I would slowly torture him to death so that he would realize how to love God.” What a strange way to manifest one's lovd for God! The Inquisitionists once showed their religious zeal by means of torture, but Mexico is no longer in the hands of the Catholic Inquisitionists, So Rivera was not tortured to death.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Enter Violence</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Since no one would compromise in the situation, violence was finally resorted to. By this time the hotel was under guard. On the afternoon of June </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font13"> about 100 Catholic college students entered he hotel in groups of two and three so that their plans would not be thwarted. At a given signal, the entire group rushed into the dining room with knives in their hands and in a few minutes scraped away the words “does not exist* leaving only the word “God” on the mural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mexico greatly rejoiced when it heard that the atheistic sentence had been erased. But the incident did not fend there. The original fight of Rivera and the archbishop continues. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">That</span><span class="font13"> very same evening at midnight Diego Rivera and another Communist muralist David Siquieros, leading a mob of about 150 people, forced their way into the dining room and there Rivera nervously penciled in the sentence “God does not exist”; after which Rivera and Siquieros each gave a short talk to the mob and then departed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Now the situation really became tense. No one knew how it would turn out. Secretly some person erased the sentence the second time. But then the whole incident stopped as suddenly as it started, when the government started to investigate the matter and prohibited</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Diego Rivera from rewriting the sentence. The hotel managers then covered the troublesome mural with a curtain and moved its dining room to another part of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the incident of the archbishop of Mexico versus the Communist Rivera neither side won, because up until* the present time the building has not received the archbishop<sup>J</sup>s blessing, even though it seems that that has not affected the prosperity of the new hotel, and the mural cannot be seen &quot;by the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span><span class="font13"> of June 4 showed how Diego Rivera used all the publicity he gained to attempt to enlarge the Communistic Sock in Mexico. At a Communist meeting which took place during the heat of the battle Siquieros stated that “the Communists were ready to fight and back up Diego Rivera&quot;. Then Rivera spoke and “repeated some of his usual phrases against imperialism, the hotel managers, Franco, etc., and, after praising Soviet Russia, he invited all those present to join the Communist Party&quot;, or the Popular Party, as it is known throughout Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is too* bad the archbishop of Mexico goes about “blessing” hotels, and straining at a gnat, while he and the rest of the Mexican hierarchy continue to keep the millions of Mexican Catholics in ignorance of the God in whom they claim to believe. As for Diego Rivera, the God he claims does not exist, Jehovah, puts people like Jiim in a class by themselves by stating, in Psalm 14:1: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.&quot; </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Awake!</span><span class="font13"> correspondent in Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Concentration </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Camps in America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">*3? Walter Winchell charged that the “Hopley Report, sponsored by Secretary Forrestal, waa a greater attack the liberty every &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than ever dreamed, of by Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">or Stalin”, After saying this over the radio, Winchell wrote in his column a few days later (New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span><span class="font9">, November 26, 1948) that on page 39 the Hopley Report suspends the Bill of Rights. On the subject of detention the report recommends: “The problem of detention is one of considerable magnitude during emergency conditions. It should be met by providing suitable, safe and secure places where persons may be detained for the public good until such time as conditions permit their release or circumstances warrant their trial. Places of detention should be provided to accommodate such persons temporarily deprived of their liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Walter Winehell logically reasons that the words “considerable magnitude” mean many are to be arrested. Also, this would allow you to be detained when </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font9"> think it would be for public good, until </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font9"> think conditions permit your release, until </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">they </span><span class="font9">think they have enough evidence to warrant giving you a trial. It provides for concentration camps now to hold you when you are temporarily deprived of your liberty. It provides for detention of persons “for the public protection”, when the Defense Department decides the public needs to be protected from you. No charges. No trial. “Heil Hopley!” adds Winchell, with more sarcasm than enthusiasm. He ably argues that the Hopley Report would open the way for crushing American labor, for demanding loyalty oaths, for depriving the common people of political opinions. He also quotes FonestaPe expressed desire that the Secretary of Defense “hire” the Secretaries of Army, Navy and Air. In other words, the president would no longer choose these cabinet members. Winchell says Forrestal would fire Truman as commander-in-chief.</span></p><img src="g_E_19490122_files/g_E_19490122-6.png" alt="" style="width:737pt;height:967pt;">

<p><span class="font13">along the sides to the very place where sugar roused no response, and there you find the taste buds that respond to salty tastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The farther back across the tongue you move a sour pickle, the more obvious its sour taste becomes. While the &quot;sour” taste buds may be more evenly distributed over the tongue than any other of the taste perceptors, yet there is a .spot just back of the tongue's “blind spot” that registers no other taste than sour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Bitterness is tasted best even farther back at the base of the tongue. A sprinkling of “bitter” taste buds occurs at the tip of the tongue, intermingled with the &quot;sweet”, “sour,” and “salty” buds. From the diagram above it can be seen that all four types of the ingenious little taste perceptors are present at the extreme tip and extreme base of the tongue; hence from the instant food enters the mouth until the instant it is swallowed, its taste can be detected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Temperature </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Affects Taste</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But just -as speech is not. an exclusive product of the tongue, likewise taste depends to some degree upon other factors. In other words, there is more to taste than what meets the taste buds. Some foods affect not only the taste buds but other nerve endings in the mouth. Among these are the &quot;hot” and spicy foods such as mustard and ginger, which set the nerve endings that respond to heat telegraphing their messages to the brain. These foods, for all physical</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">JANUAUl 22,1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">purposes, cause the same reaction in the mouth as does something hot They are not giving off a taste so much as they are creating a kind of physical pain in the mouth. When we think we are tasting hot pepper we are more literally smarting from the pain it causes upon the nerve endings that respond to heat</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Foods that are actually hot register a different degree of taste than when they are cold. Warmth stimulates the taste buds, makes them quicker to respond. Hence, a factor that helps determine taste, a factor outside the taste buds themselves, is heat. People who are more concerned about the pleasure of taste than about their physical welfare indulge in eating and drinking foods that are too hot for health's sake. When the taste senators are abused by overheating they are unable to register any taste at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">No less vital than the riieat” nerves are the &quot;cold” nerves which contribute their share toward modifying the sense of taste. While warmth stimulates the taste buds, cold cuts down their sensitivity. If the doctor obliges you to take a violently bitter medicine, first rub an ice cube back and forth over your tongue until the tongue feels numb. Then take your medicine. It will not taste so bitter. You have chilled the taste buds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The power of cold to subdue the taste buds may in some cases produce advantages. Some wines taste better cold, because chilling masks their less palatable qualities; the advantage, or disadvantage, in this lies with the user.

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Feeling and Smelling a Taste</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Does it strike you as odd that some tastes have to be felt and smelled! Yet consider for a moment how great a role the sense of touch plays in creating no end of taste impressions. Crackers are worse than tasteless and unsavory unless they are crisp and crunchy. Who cares how good the flavor of a steak is unless the meat it Self is reasonably tender! If you are one of those persons who think raw oysters are horrible, it probably is not the flavor you object to at all, but the &quot;slimy&quot; feel of raw oysters </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">th</span><span class="font13"> the mouth. The biting or burning avor of spices, the coolness of j&gt;eppor-mint flavor, the tickle of soda-water bubbles—all these are obviously flavor elements. Yet none of their can be tasted or even smelled. They have to be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">felt. </span><span class="font13">While some might argue that the physical “feel” of a food has nothing actually to do with its taste, yet who will say that the touch sense does not greatly influence the Ekes and dislikes of all of us when it comes to taste preferences!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As for the role that smell plays, you can demonst raie for yourself by merely holding your nose while eating, that a great host of foods, such as fruits, coffee and butter, depend more upon their odor than upon the taste buds to convey their true flavor. Odor is sensed just as readily from the mouth as from the nose. There is a rear entrance through the throat into the smelling apparatus in the head. Every time we swallow, some of the air which has passed over the food in the mouth rises into the smelling area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Up there, in the upper part of the nasal cavity, is an area about the size of a postage stamp, containing a group of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">highly specialised nerve endings called </span><span class="font13">the olfactory cells, From each of the tiny olfactory cells six to eight small <sup>if</sup>hairs” protrude beyond the mucous layer. They pick up the odor sensations and carry them through the olfactory nerve to the lobes, which gather all the impressions into one nerve response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Below the olfactory cells &quot;is another area of nerve fibers which are capable o' registering the tactile or &quot;feel” components of flavor such as* the qualities of cold, heat, tickling, piquancy, etc. How these ingenious sense perceptors of smell co-operate with the sense of touch and the sense of taste to produce the complete and single sensation of a flavor is a marvel worth contemplating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Think of a time when your nasal passages were stopped; then it seemed that just about everything you ate tasted alike, or, rather, everything alike seemed to have no taste at all. What you missed was, not the taste, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">but the odor of</span><span class="font13"> food. Shut your eyes, hold your nose, and let some one feed you some chopped apple and chopped onion; which one is which? Even strawberries taste much like onions provided you cannot inhale their <sup>f</sup> aroma while you eat. What we often mistake for a bad taste is in fact a bad odor, as in the case of cod liver oil. The senses of taste and smell co-operate so closely that we hardly know for sure whether we are smelling or tasting. Chloroform, for example, does not stimulate the “smell” sen si tors,' but rather the taste buds at the tip of the tongue. Although we think we are smelling chloroform in the air, we are actually tasting it</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">By the wonderfully co-ordinated interplay of the faculties oT taste, smell and feel, all of them registering simultaneously in the brain, and their reactions further modified by the temperature of the food, a sensation is produced that is in reality more than &quot;taste”. A word with a fuller meaning is &quot;flavor”. Flavor k the combination of all the sensations produced in the mouth by food. Because the joy of eating is derived from the flavor, and because flavor cannot he confined within the narrow limits of a definition, a way is left open whereby even the senses of seeing and hearing can be played upon to further enhance the pleasure of eating. The restaurateur knows that the more delectably a dish is prepared the more palatable it will seem, even though his customer may not ordinarily like the dish. And if embraced in an atmosphere of soft lights and the melody of music, the menu becomes all the more irresistible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Equipped with a refined knowledge of the factors that produce the sensations of flavor, the food processor, the chef, the baker, the restaurateur and the hostess have conspired to create a world of ersatz flavor thrills that seduce the appetite but fail to produce sound health. For example, the baker strives to produce a loaf with a pleasing taste plus a texture having just the right &quot;feel&quot;, a clean bite, and a tender crust These qualities are better combined when he uses lifeless “white&quot; flour rather than nutritious whole-grain flour. What is overlooked is that the true tastiness of food should be influenced more by the physical soundness and healtljy appetite of the consumer, rather than by an appetite stimulated by artificially crunchy goodness and synthetic taste thrills.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Practical of Flavor Knowledge</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">When the meat-packer salts meat too heavily he tones it down by adding sugar, knowing that strong salt and sugar solutions applied to the tongue at the same time cancel each other. The taste-wise cook avoids serving a menu of too many flavors, which might cancel each other and leave the diners feeling that the meal, no matter how sumptuous, was somehow just not up to par. He builds the menu around one taste, so that a predominating flavor is enhanced by the others, the way one theme predominates a melody in music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The housewife haying a knowledge of flavor patterns knows that a heavy concentration of one taste affects the reaction to the tastes that follow’. Brussels sprouts may be the family's delight, but if served after a sour food, like kraut, their flavor will seem tepid and dull. A cereal served after grapefruit tastes sweeter than if served after toast and jam. Coffee tastes sweeter before rather than after a sw<sup>T</sup>eet dessert. The experienced hostess arranges the dishes in the order that permits the taste of one to enhance rather than neutralize the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Each, of the four basic tastes—sweet, sour, salty, bitter—has its distinctive role in the flavor pattern, and serves to make the most ordinary food taste better if skillfully employed. Bitterness, most people’s notions to the contrary, is the most exciting to the appetite. The old folks of a past generation didn't drink their “bitters&quot; before meals just for the sake of the alcohol in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Just as bitterness is the most exciting, sour is the most refreshing taste. A little lemon juice brings out the flavor of fish or spinach. Sour tastes are derived from food acids. There is lactic acid in milk, citric acid in oranges and lemons, acetic acid in vinegar, malic acid in apples, and the sourest of all common fruit acids is the tartaric acid in grapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When it comes to salty tastes, there is an equally wide variety.zln the Orient a chemical called glutamates is used to lend meat flavor to foods. Glutamates, labeled mon-sodium-glutamate by the chemists, is about seven tinjes as salty as table salt. The salty taste gives a sense of zestful, nourishing, satisfying completeness to a ineaL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And, of course, the favorite taste is the sweet. I: is relished more for the sake of its taste alone than ail the rest. Jr takes something sweet to add the crowning touch 10 the meal—not so much for the sake of the nourishment found in sweet foods, but for the pure joy of tasting sweetness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Is the range of tastes that excites the senses less wide and varied than </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font13">shapes and colors that attract the eye end the sounds that entertain the ear? Truly the Creator has provided an illim</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">itable symphony of sensations to play upon the organs of sense, and in the coming Paradise of harmony and balance in the New World it will be delightsome to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">live</span><span class="font13"> and respond to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">perfection</span><span class="font13"> to ail that greets the senses, including the tingling joys to be derived from your marvelous sens© of taste.—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&lt;L An oatline of life on the Pacific isle of Samoa given before the United Nations so enchanted some who read the report that they asked, ‘What is the quickest way to get thereT The United States delegation painted Samoan Living as a blissful existence on breeze-swept islands, where everyone lived lazily off natural bounties, doctors sent no bills, and income taxes came to five dollars annually for adult males only. Ten percent of the inhabitants work for money; the others care nothing for it, as it is virtually a surplus commodity in a land where almost everything was available for the taking. Why, it was refreshing to hear that very few residents even thought enough of radio sets to own one. Upon hearing these alluring reports persons began writing to find out the quickest way io get there and to stay for good. The majority were sick of this human folly called “civilization”, where the money-mad and power-insane and socially vain claw and bite and fight to get atop the seething mass of restless humanity. But refugees bent on escaping the savagery of civilization struck a sn&amp;g that scuttled their hopes. The United States government has ruled that practically no one-way passages would be permitted to the Polynesian &quot;paradise of the Pacific”. This ehilling damper was put out reluctantly, it was stated, to preserve the simple, primitive beauty of Samoa-One official conceded that the best way for anyone wanting to live in Samoa was to marry a Samoan.

<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font13">HERE are m-any plants that have stamina enough to resist the cruel dryness of earth's desert wastelands. Among these, there are none more strange than those that shrivel up and apparently die when it becomes too dry, and then, when a little water reaches them, even if it is years later, they come to life again. “Sus tended animation” is what some people have called this dormant condition. In Asia, Africa and North and South America several nonrelated plants possessing this miraculous rejuvenating ability have been popularly named “resurrection” plants. Probably the most famous of these queer desert plants is the rose of Jericho found in Palestine, Arabia, Persia and Egypt. Sometimes in that arid land it can be found growing on the flat rooftops pf the houses. In reality the rose of Jericho is not a rose at all. It belongs to the order of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">C^uciferae,</span><span class="font13"> which has 175 genera and some 1,500 species, and which includes the cabbage, turnip, mustard, cress, radish and horseradish families. Naturalists give the “rose” the botanical name of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Anastatica hierochuntica,</span><span class="font13"> which is probably the best explanation as to why everybody else calls it the rose of Jericho. The stem divides at the base into many branches that bear spikes of tiny white flowers that develop into round fruit or pods containing the seeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If a dry spell seems to kill the rose of Jericho when it is only partly grown it will again take on the appearance of life and begin to grow within a few hours after its roots are moistened. The buds ,swell, the leaves of the calyx open, the petals unfold, the flower stalk grows, and itill-bloom flowers appear,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Another remarkable thing about this little plant, which seldom grows more than six inches high, is the way it migrates from place to place. Instead of easting its seeds hither and thither when they are ripe, as other plants do, it has a very unique way all of its own. The leaves fall o^ and the branches fold inward to form a ball or basket containing the seed pods. Then when autumn winds start to blow the plant breaks off an the ground and rolls out to see the world. Eventually it will come to rest many miles from its home, usually in a low, hollow place where moisture is most likely to collect the following spring. Still holding its seeds it does not uncoil and open its pods until rain falls sufficient to assure germination of the next generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During the Dark Ages, when humanity sank to its lowest depths in ignorance and superstition, and when priestcraft rose to a high degree of deception, the rose of Jericho became a ready-made instrument in the tricky hands of the clergy, quacks and charlatans. These rascals gave the plant such names as “Rosa Mariae”, “Rose of the Virgin” and “Mary's Hand”, and then proceeded to spin a web of superstition around its extraordinary and peculiar characteristics. They told the credulous people of Europe that it grew only at the stopping stations along the trail taken by Mary and Joseph during their flight from Bethlehem to Egypt with the babe Jesus. Moreover, by the trickery of placing imported specimens in water just at the right time they convinced the ignorant people that it bloomed every year on the</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Rhodesia's Resurrection Plant</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Visitors to the Rhodesias in Africa are familiar with still another “resurrection” plant that grows among the gray granite boulders of the Matopos Hills, among which is situated the famous 'World's View”. Belonging to the small genus of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Myrothamnus,</span><span class="font13"> and called by-the botanist </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">M. flabellifolius,</span><span class="font13"> this plant is a giant compared with the rose of Jericho. When “alive” and growing it reaches a height of two feet, but when “dead” (at least three-quarters of the year) it shrivels up and is only a dwarf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It seems that the first European to come upon this Rhodesian resurrection plant was Frei Joao dos Santos, He describes his journey into the interior from Portuguese East Africa in his book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ethiopia Orientate,</span><span class="font13"> published in 1609, and undoubtedly he refers to Manica-land, the northern half of Southern Rhodesia, when he writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the Kingdom of Maniea a small tree grows on the top of rocks and mountains which, for the greater part of the year, is bare and without leaf or verdure, but it has this strange property—that if a branch is cut off and thrown in water, in the space of twelve hours it buds and blossoms into green leaves, and when it is taken oi^t of the water it becomes as dry as ever. . , . This wood powdered and taken in water is a good remedy for dysentery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Portuguese in Portuguese Angola scent their houses with branches of the plant when they are green. This is because the shrub is balsamiferous, that is, one that produces balsam and has a strong aromatic scent. It is probably due to this fact that the natives believe it has curative powers over many diseases. Says Dr. Friedriek Welwitsch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The natives in Pungo Andongo (Portuguese Angola) employ the shoots in the form of a cold or warm infusion to cure headaches, and in the form of fumigations in the treatment of rheumatic pains and sudden paraly« sis; also the Portuguese colonists hold in high esteem its medicinal virtues and keep its dried branches instead of incense to perfume their houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of the endless variety in both design and function found in the vegetation that clothes this earth the resurrection plants truly stand out as most remarkable and unusual. In fact, one reverential worshiper of the Almighty Creator, in observing the handiwork of these plants^ exclaimed what a similarity there is between them and the people of this present evil world, who are dry and dead for lack of the life-giving waters of God’s truth! When people of good-will come in contact with the Kingdom truth and absorb it as the resurrection plant does Water, they quickly blossom forth in good works, praising the great Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font13">SE American people are smoking more cigarettes than ever before. The figures for 1947 run 7 percent ahead of 1946, The grand total comes to 327 billion cigarettes. That's more than 100 packages of 20 cigarettes for every man, woman, and child in the country; it's about 6 cigarettes (more than a.quarter of a pack) a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Doctors disagree on just how much harm we do our bodies when we smoke. There is no doubt that the smoke itself irritates some people's sinuses, as well as the membranes of the nose, mouth, throat and lun'gs. Other people are allergic to tobacco in any form. Smoking contracts the blood vessels. It reduces our ability to see far and clearly. It introduces carbon monoxide to the blood stream. It has bad effects on diabetics and sufferers from certain heart ailments. Alcohol, «n the other hand, makes the blood vessels expand. But this does not mean, as some optimists have asserted, that the bad effects of alcohol and tobacco cancel each other off. It takes alcohol an hour or an hour and a half to affect the blood vessels; so unless you are going to smoke a lot longer and drink a lot more than is good for you anyway, you won't repair the bad effects of smoking by having a drink and you won't repair the bad effects of having a drink by smoking. You will not find it hard to get through the first day without smoking. It's the first six weeks that give the real trouble. Eor it takes six weeks for the system to get rid of the past effects of tobacco and for the physical craving to subside. The nervous craving may, of course, last much longer; it never entirely departs. But on one point doctors and laymen agree. The best way to cut down smoking is to cut it out altogether. Perhaps the most annoying minor hardship from which the<sub>f</sub> British people now suffer is the high price of tobacco. With cigarettes selling at nearly seventy cents a package, not many people in the British Isles can smoke as much as they would like. Therefore they ration themselves and make each cigarette last to the bitter end, holding it on a pin. This may not be too healthy, because the last inch of the cigarette puts four or five times as much nicotine into the system as the first inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Most of the serious damage that tobacco can do comes from the nicotine it contains. As you probably know, nicotine has no color. That yellow stain that appears on the fingers of inveterate smokers is not nicotine, but tar. It may produce irritation, but .nothing worse. Just how much nicotine does, the doctors themselves do not know. Men, generally speaking, still smoke more than women, especially older men. And Dr. William H. Rienhoff, Jr., of Johns Hopkins, has recently compiled figures showing that cancer of the lungs kills six times as many men as it' kills women. This may not be the nicotine. It may not even be the smoking. We shall know more in another generation now that younger women are smoking about as much as men. This much, however, we do know: The infertility of rats inoculated with nicotine goes up from 17 percent, the normal figure, to 33 percent, and human beings are one or two hundred times more sensitive to nicotine than rats. But the effect of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">tobacco on different individuals varies enormously. If you cut your cigarette </span><span class="font13">consumption in two but inhale twice as </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">much, </span><span class="font13">you are no better off. Some people </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font13"> nicotine poisoning by smoking only one cigarette a day. Pipe smokers swallow a lot of nicotine, but smoking does not affect them in so many ways, or so seriously, as it affects cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoke may irritate the ends of the nerves in the upper windpipe. Pipe smokers often do not breathe their smoke deeply enough to have it reach any part of their breathing equipment; and that’s all to the good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The late </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dt.</span><span class="font13"> Raymond Pearl, of Johns Hopkins, showed. that heavy smokers have a shorter life-span than moderate smokers or nonsmokers. He could find no great difference between the life-spans of moderate smokers and non-smokers. In one field of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">research</span><span class="font13"> into the effects of tobacco on the human system, doctors have shown a timidity, a caution unworthy of the best traditions </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">their profession. Never has any med-, ical journal carried any comparative data on various brands of cigarette by name. For instance, three researchers at </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">Medical College of Virginia tried blowing the smoke of different kinds of tobacco, different blends, and different </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">brands into the </span><span class="font13">eyes of rabbits to find out which caused the most irritation. They found that they produced a wide variety of effects. But when it came to revealing what blends of tobacco went into various brands of cigarette and, when it came to comparing, which brand of cigarette smoke produced the most, and the least, irritation the researchers said nothing. They mentioned no brandnames at any point. This is surprising on several counts. Scientists customarily give full details about all their experiments. They tell what kinds of animals they use; they describe their equip</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ment </span><span class="font13">and the conditions under which they work. Nor is the scientist under any special obligation to the tobacco companies, Many of the magazines for which he writes run no general advertising. Is it fear of indirect pressure! But if such pressure do.es exist, surely one scientist would have defied that pressure at least once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Getting back again to our Virginia researchers, they also found that tightly rolled cigarettes produced less irritation than loosely rolled cigarettes and that moist tobacco produced less irritation than dry tobacco. But again they did not reveal which cigarettes are the most tightly rolled or which' contain the greatest proportion of moisture. All they said was that each brand was standard and that the same brand always produced the same effect. From this experiment, the average smoker will conclude—what he already knows from his own experience—that the loosely rolled cigarette </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">he makes for himself gives off a hotter </span><span class="font13">smoke than the tightly rolled, machine-made cigarette. But for all he knows the tobacco in Bull Durham, for example, may be less irritating than the tobacco in Lucky Strike,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The various cigarette manufacturers make various claims in their advertising— </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">based the preference of doctors</span><span class="font13"> on the proportion of irritants that they say their brands contain. If these claims are no more satisfying than the veiled findings of the doctors, perhaps the reason in both cases is that no one test can be applied to any one tobacco or cigarette. One may be more irritating; another may contain more nicotine. The effect of the same cigarette on different people may be quite different. What’s one man’s meat can be another man’s poison, as sufferers from allergies know all too well. Moreover, tobacco is big business here in the United States, and an important item in world trade. Its the chief cash crop of hundreds of thousands of our farmers. Why disturb the goose that lays so many golden eggs?—Quincy Howe broadcast on Frontiers of Science, December 16, 1947,</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">M</span><span class="font13">AN’S thirst for the bounties of nature early drove him across the face of the globe, but the spurs on that ride have been his lust for the yellow metal called gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How true this has been of Alaska! At first furs were the bounty nature paid, and comparatively few hardy souls braved the rigors of the northern clime to wrest that wealth from the land. But when the cry changed to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Gold!”</span><span class="font13"> thousands, yes, scores of thousands wdre* spurred on, each in a mad dash to be an early arrival in the land where wealth for a lifetime of »ase could be won from a small plot of ground in a short season or two. As in Bible times when the gold of Ophir was more precious than the life of man, so the gold of Alaska was more precious than a human life. Many received death as their wages, either by trudging into the grip of winter ill-prepared or by' being foully murdered for the gold they had come to wrest from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before we follow the trail of the Alaskan gold miners let us consider how gold occurs and is won from the earth. There are two broad divisions of gold-mining: placer and hard rock. As the surface of the earth eroded the heavy gold would lag behind like sand in the bottom of a washing machine on washday. Always balking at being moved and always seek-</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">ALONG ALASKANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">GOLD TRAILS J</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">ing the bottom of the creek bed the gold was concentrated over a period of many years. This has given rise to the first main division of mining—placer mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How did man recover this gold which the stream had so obligingly concentrated for him whether in Alaska or in Havi-lah (Genesis 2:11) ? By creating an artificial creek bottom of his own and running the material of the creek through it. His basic piece of equipment was and is a “pan”. Today an actual steel frying pan can be used, although special pans are made. Shoveling his pan full of gravel the miner loosens the mass with water </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">and a peculiar shaking motion which </span><span class="font13">settles the gold to the bottom. He slowly washes the barren material over the side and picks out the coarse worthless material bv hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This can be seen as very slow; so he enlarges his “creek bottom” by building a trough that can be rocked back and forth. The gold can be caught between slats in the bottom and the worthless rock washed over the sides with water. Still too slow; so he builds a long trough called a sluice and runs water through it. For his “creek bottom” the ancient could use the skin of a sheep and the heavy gold would be caught in the wool and the lighter material washed away, and there would be his 'golden fleece’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the first miner worked out the known placer deposits, his thirst for gold remained unslaked; so he looked around for more gold. He found the roots of the veins (the filled-in cracks in the earth’s crust) from which the water had been concentrating the gold. This rock was generally easily </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">broken and with crude </span><span class="font13">equipment he could crush it to release the gold, then by using hie artificial creek be4s he could recover the gold. Thus the second division of mining was born, hard rock mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As his work carried him down below the surface where the action of air and Water had aided him by altering the vein material and decomposing certain minerals he found he recovered less and less gold. He found more and more of a ma* terial we now call sulphides (various elements combined chemically with sub phur)* They stopped him for centuries. Finally he learned that by the application of heat he could get at the gold locked in the rock- Today, in Africa there are remains of smelters which some speculate might have been used to smelt the rock to recover some of the gold Solomon used in the wonderful temple at Jerusalem. Few mines were rich enough to justify this method, and sq until modern times the only mines that could be worked were those in which the gold was free milling—the gold not being associated in a finely divided state with sulphides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In placer mining man is*fcreed to use exactly the same principles of recovery as did the ancients. His progress is in application of labor-saving devices. Somewhere along the line, though, he did learn that mercury is a very effective trap for the gold and he developed various means of using it to catch the gold. It is in his treatment of hard rock that he has made progress and introduced new methods. In recent times a tremendous stride was made in the treatment of ores which had frustrated the ancients. It was found that a cyanide solution would dissolve the gold and it could then be recovered from the cyanide solution. This opened the way for many deposits to be worked that could not be handled by other means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then came a new word—flotation. It was observed by a woman washing some miners' work clothes that specks of the minerals in the mine floated on the soap bubbles even though many times as heavy as water. From this has been developed the method of mineral separation known as flotation. Chemical agents were found which would float some materials and not others. Thus gold-bearing sulphides were recovered and even sulphides of the base metals lead and zinc could be separated.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Alaska Gold Rush</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Now with this as a background we are ready to look at gold-mining in Alaska. Present-day events have put Alaska in the news and most people are aware that it was purchased from the Russians in 1867. Strange as it may seem to Americans to whom the words gold, cold, and Alaska are synonymous, the Russians were mainly interested in furs and knew little about its gold. In 1848 a Russian mining engineer was sent there. He found gold on the Kenai river on Cook Inlet but not in paying quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1869 some prospectors going north from Fort Wrangell discovered placers on Windham and Sundum bays, $40,000 wdrth of gold was recovered in two seasons, making this the first real mining venture in Alaska. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Prospectors</span><span class="font13"> from Sitka found gold on a creek, which they called Gold creek, located in what is now Juneau. Various prospecting was carried on, and a little gold found here and there; some near Rampart in 1883, and near the present-day site of Circle around 1885.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Id</span><span class="font13"> 1881 a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">miner, John</span><span class="font13"> Treadwell, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">came </span><span class="font13">north to investigate reports of a rich prospect back of Juneau. He turned down the property, which later became the largest mine in Alaska, and purchased the mine across the channel on Douglas island, which came to be known as the Treadwell. This proved to be a profitable mine. In one place a great open pit called a &quot;glory hole' was made, then underground great masses of rock were removed. Finally the pressure became too great, cracks were formed, salt</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">water started to come in, and on the night of April 21, 1917, the beach caved in, taking several buildings with it, and the mine was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Outside of these two mines very little hard rock gold-mining has been done in Alaska, largely because of the terrific costs encountered here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1896 gold was discovered on the tributaries of the Yukon in Canada, and when the Portland landed at Seattle July 17,1897, with around a million dollars in gold, the news precipitated the mad rush to the northern gold fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">. At one time Skagway, Dyea and the sites along the trail had a population of 60,000, After the killing climbs to the summit, the gold-seekers had it downhill to the headwaters of navigation, where they stopped to saw lumber by hand for, their boats. Finally those with determination and rugged constitutions arrived at the gold fields hundreds of miles away. There they staked their claims, plots of ground of a size determined by law which were marked out by stakes, and started to dig. The gold poured into the saloons, dance halls, and gambling dens as men half-crazed by the loneliness of the Tong, dark winter would seek the solace of the bright lights. Comparatively few took their stakes home. Sometimes over a million would be taken from one claim. The creeks, the slopes, the hills even, were covered with men feverishly digging to bedrock and then, if they “hit it&quot;, gouging out along bedrock. But the thousands were too many for even the rich discoveries of the Yukon, and many had to look to other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So we must continue our journey. We can take a luxurious river steamer for our journey, but they took anything that woula float. Down the Yukon we go. Fortymile, Eagle, Circle—these had produced some gold as the miners restlessly dug and pushed northward. But soon came the cry, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Gold</span><span class="font13"> at Nome/'' and the bung came out of the barrel and spewed </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">JANUARY 22,1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the contents on the beach at Nome. So let's away to Nome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was in 1898 that three men of Scandinavian descent landed near Cape Nome and found gold on the edge of the river, even on the beach. They systematically prospected the creek and staked what later turned out to be some of the best claims in the district When the news spread the rush was on. The first arrivals gave way to their gluttony and “jumped&quot; the three discovered claims and started a practice that was a disgrace. Anarchy followed as greed went to seed, and claims were staked two or three times, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thenee to</span><span class="font13"> fight it out in the courts. The original discoverers had to put up a long, expensive fight to keep from being robbed of their own claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1899 the new arrivals found everything plastered with notices. They started on the beach and found that wages could be made and sometimes up to $200 in a day. In 1900 there were </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">30,000 people</span><span class="font13"> in Nome. The rich beach sands were made for the promoters and companies were formed and stock sold without limit, Why, if mere men could make wages by hand, what could engineers and equipment not do? That most of the human race is looking for something^ for nothing is proved by the fact that literally hundreds of gold-saving devices flooded the beach at Nome. However, the sands were soon worked out and another bubble broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A new cry was heard—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Fairbanks! </span><span class="font13">In 1902 a premature rush was started. Anywhere the cry of *Gold' was bayed the pack was soon in full cry after it. Because so few found any gold many thought they had been cheated. But the gold was just a little deeper and harder to get. So it was in 1904 that the camp really started to hum.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Prospector Procedure</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Now we'll follow the operations in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">development of</span><span class="font13"> a typical northern gold camp. Our prospector decides that here</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">is a likely place to start. A number of creeks pome together, draining a considerable area. Up the creeks he starts, digging small holes, trying to get to bedrock. As lie digs he pans some of the material. If the ground looks promising he will conduct water through a long trough called a sluice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Our prospector finds enough to make it worth his time to investigate further; so he builds a log cabin, for winter is coming on, Reinstalls a small boiler, and conducts the steam to a short length of pipe with a driving head called a point As he drives and thaws, drives and thaws, his point goes slowly into the ground. He repeats the process until he has a small area all thawed out. This he digs out with his &quot;‘muck stick” (shovel). Then the process is repeated until he reaches bedrock, all the while panning </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a portion for</span><span class="font13"> samples. He </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">has </span><span class="font13">found colors enough to keep him interested. Now comes the bedrock, the crucial test. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A strike!</span><span class="font13"> He drifts along the bedrock to the edge of his claim, again driving his points to thaw the ground. At his boundary he starts thawing and removing all except a few pillars, gouging into the bedrock to get al] he can. By this time the cry has gone out and hundreds are doing the same all around him. All are storing their gravel until spring, when water will be available to run a sluice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Finally the ground rich enough to work in &quot;this manner is exhausted. Some have taken out thousands, some hundreds of thousands, some a million, but the majority went away broke. In some of the creeks the gravel is neither so deep nor so rich; so groups get together and build a long ditch to bring in water at a high elevation so that it can be conducted through a giant nozzle under high pressure. Hence the name “giant” is applied to the huge nozzles. This tears </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">into </span><span class="font13">the gravel and washes it down into the sluices. And what a sight it is to see those streams of water, capable of cutting a man in half, smash into a gravel bank, cutting out yards a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Still gold remains that cannot be obtained by any of these methods. Next, after thorough drilling to sample the ground, conies the giant floating dredges with many heavy buckets on an endless chain and a boom. On the largest dredges these can be lowered to dig over a hundred feet below the surface of the pond in which the dredge floats. Off goes the worthless overburden by means of giants, bulldozers and draglines. Out come the points so that material can be thawed ahead of the dredge. Down go the buckets, up comes the paydirt, up to the top of the dredge. Down through the revolving screens, where the material is classified according to size and most of it rejected and sent out over the stern on a long endless belt called a stacker. Over the jigs, where pulsations‘of water allow the gold to settle out, over the tables, over the rubber sluices, over the trough sluices, over a variety of gold-saving devices according to company’s practice, always giving the gold an opportunity to settle and be caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Comes the cleanup; get out the shotgun guards, and open the traps, and clean the sluices, $50,000, $100,000 or a million, according to the ground. Back and forth go the dredges building peculiar fan-shaped piles of rock behind the stacker, up the creek and down, over the same ground the miners worked by hand. They did not get it all, not by many a <sup>k</sup>poke’. Finally the creeks for miles are nothing but a barren pile of gravel in their fan-shaped ridges, utterly worthless now to man and beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Amid some of the most awe-inspiring scenery in the world, amid fabulous resources, it is strange how the majority have taken these natural bounties for granted and, while boasting of theiV love for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">their fellow man, have been blinded </span><span class="font13">to even the existence of an intelligent Creator.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awoke!</span><span class="font13"> correspondent in Alaska.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Soul Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">I</span><span class="font13">N OUR previous issue we showed Biblically that the lower animals are souls just as well as man is a soul. But let no . </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> reader misunderstand us to teach that, because all living, moving creatures, from an insect to a rhinoceros and from a polliwog to a whale, are living souls, all these must therefore have a future life, either by a transfer to spirit conditions or by a resurrection from the dead. Such a thought would be arrant nonsense, insanity, without a shadow of reason. Billions of living souls on those lower levels of animal life are born every minute, while other billions of such animal souls die every minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The .point we make is this, that man is a soul or creature of the highest earthly order, to whom originally in Eden the commission was given to have dominion over the lower orders of animal souls or sentient creatures. And yet man was also an earthly sentient creature, but so grandly constituted in his original perfection that the first man Adam was properly described as being in the likeness of God, the image of Him that created man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As a soul, man is differentiated from the lower animals or souls by reason of his higher organism and mental power s. His superiority is not merely indicated by his upright form, but witnessed to by his superior mental endowments, which are godlike and are reflected in his countenance. It is by his mental and moral endowments rather than in physical form that man was created in divine likeness. While many of the lower orders of animal soul possess reasoning powers and demonstrate them in thousands of ways, yet each has a level beyond which no progress can be made. But man’s reasoning powers are almost unlimited, because he was created an “image of God”, the likeness of Him that created him. Notwithstanding man's fall into sin and his thousands of years in gross darkness and degradation, we can still see traits of godlikeness, especially in those who have accepted Christ Jesus and through Him have become “sons of God” and who are .seeking to be conformed to the image of God’s dear Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For instance: Horses, dogs and birds may be taught the meaning of many words so as to be able*to understand many things pertaining to human affairs. They often demonstrate their reasoning powers, and some are able to count, as high as twenty. Yet, who would try to teach a horse or a dog or a bird algebra or geometry or astronomy? The highest of the lower animals can be taught a certain degree of moral restraint and obligation to their masters, not to kill sheep, not to bite, kick, etc., but who would attempt to teach such dumb brutes the Ten Commandments? They may be taught a certain kind of love for their master and his friends, but who would think of teaching them to love or worship God, or more than mere endurance of enemies who had despitefully used them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What we should notice is that all these differences are not by reason of lower animals' having a different kind of breath of life. God’s Word, at Ecclesiastes 3:19 says as regards man and beast: “Yea, they have all one breath.” Nor is it because man is a soul and the brute beast is not, for the Bible directly says that brute beasts are all souls. But as all men are witnesses, each creature has a differ</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ent </span><span class="font13">bodily organism which gives to each his different characteristics, and which alone constitutes one creature higher and another lower in the scale of intelligence. Take note, too, that not size and weight give excellence and superiority, else the elephant and whale would be the ’ords of earth: the excellence is in the organic quality represented chiefly in brain structure and functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'Man is therefore the highest type of earthly creature, “of the earth, earthy/<sup>7 </sup>(1 Corinthians 15:47) His excellence consists in the superiority of his mental endowment, which is not an evolution or self-development, but is a gift from his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In our first paragraph we said that animal souls die every minute by the billions. Well, then, when inantlies, does he, too, die as a soul? Yes. It is quite out of harmony with the usual religious thought on the subject but altogether in harmony with the above paragraphs that we find the Bible declaring repeatedly the death of the soul. We read, for example, that our Lord Jesus, when He Became our ransom sacrifice, <sup>#i</sup>poured out his soul </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh]</span><span class="font13"> unto death,” and <sup>(C</sup>thou shalt make his soul </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">[nepkesK]</span><span class="font13"> an offering for sin.” (Isaiah 63:12,10) This was necessary* because it was the human soul that was condemned to death, and God’s promise to obedient mankind is a redemption of human soul or power of life from the grasp of death. Psalm 49:15 says: “God will redeem my soul </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh]</span><span class="font13"> from the power of the grave/<sup>1</sup> Because all believers in Christ are thus redeemed by His offering of himself for sin, they are all said to “sleep in Jesus”.—1 Thessalonians 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">One of </span><span class="font13">the most direct statements of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">God's </span><span class="font13">Word on soul death is that at</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Ezekiel 18: 4, reading: “The soul that sins, that soul shall die.” (Moffatt's translation) Now the apostle says that Christian souls sleep in* Jesus their Redeemer. As the natural sleep each night of a human soul, if it is sound, implies total unconsciousness to that soul, so with soul death as a figurative sleep. It is a period of absolute unconsciousness. More than that, it is a period of absolute nonexistence, except as such soul is preserved in God's memory and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thus subject</span><span class="font13"> to His future purpose and exercise of power. Hence the awakening from death on the part<sub>T</sub> of those restored to life by a resurrection will mean a revival of consciousness from the exact moment and standpoint where consciousness was lost in death. There will be no appreciation of time, as respects the interval between death and resurrection. The moment of, awakening will be the next moment after the instant of death, so far as conscious appreciation is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A similar condition has been noted in connection with persons who' have sustained injuries which have caused pressure upon the brain, so that consciousness was temporarily suspended without life being snuffed out- In cases of this kind, when the pressure upon the brain has been removed by trepanning, the subject suddenly regaining consciousness has in many instances been known to complete a sentence that had been interrupted by the concussion which interrupted his thinking. In the resurrection of human souls the divine power will reproduce or thoroughly duplicate every convolution of every brain and vivify them. Thus in the awakening time the resurrected humans will revive with the same words and thoughts with which they expired. It is by the infinite grace, of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus that soul death for humankind has been transformed into a figurative sleep from what might have been eternal destruction or annihilation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Women Clergy in the Danish State Church</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">F</span><span class="font13">OR the first time in its long history three women were ordained as priests in the Danish State Church, on April 28, 1948* In view of the fact that the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and other state churches, do not have women clergy and because the question of women clergy in the churches has been so thoroughly discussed in the Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam, as welt as in the Lambeth Conference in London in August and September, we shall briefly trace how the ordination of women clergy came to be approved and carried out in Denmark, despite the fact that the College of Bishops was divided, seven being against and two in favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1915 women were allowed, for the first time, to vote in the election of members of the Lower House (Folketing) and the Upper House (Landsting) of the Danish Parliament, on the same footing as men. Then on January 14, 1919, a proposal was laid before Parliament that women should be allowed to serve in state and municipal offices on the same terms as men, That gave the theological faculty of Copenhagen University food for thought. The result: they wrote the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs on February 13, 1919, suggesting there was invalid reason why women should not be allowed to enter the Christian ministry. The Lower House agreed to both proposals. The Upper House objected. The ordination of women was not approved. Thereupon the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs sent circular letters to the various Church councils throughout the land, but, as a result of the votes taken, the suggested ordination of women was turned down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, on various occasions between 1920 and 1946, the question of ordaining women as priests was brought forward, and slowly the Upper House came around to the view that women</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">JANUARY 32,1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">could be ordained to the priesthood. Accordingly, in the spring of 1947, Dean C. M. Hermansen of the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs proposed a law allowing women to be ordained as priests. This was passed by both Houses, for, when church and state are united, the former cannot decide such matters alone. The Danish Parliament said that positions as clergy were jobs like any othe? and that, if women were capable, they could fill such jobs. The Scriptural view of the matter was completely ignored: here were jobs with salaries attached, and if women could fill them, why, that settled the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before the proposed ordination of the three women took place, several clergymen in Funen, Falster and Lolland wrote to the College of Bishops in December, 1947, protesting against the ordination of women, and this letter was considered by a meeting of the bishops on January 5, 1948. In due course Bishop Fuglsang-Damgaard replied, and the relevant part of his letter follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You have asked if a prospective ordination of a woman to a position as priest in the Established Church by the /Bishop of the diocese of Funen will be considered as exclusively a private affair between the bishop concerned, the ordained and the congregation, or as an expression of the Danish State Church’s official doctrine and practice with reference to the service of the Word. That is a question that has rightly occasioned great tension in the Church and also within the Bishop’s circle. An evangelical Lutheran religious community must, however, suffer that tension without the fellowship of the sacraments and the gospel being broken. We find, therefore, that it will be wrong to call forth a disruption on the basis of the very special case at issue. We shall not, as a result thereof, establish any of the State Church’s doctrine and practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As will be seen, the reply was rather vague. However, one of the three women</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">27</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ordained is merely priest for women prisoners in a state prison. Another is assistant to a clergyman. The third is priest in a free congregation. There are a few such free congregations attached to the Danish State Church and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">in these </span><span class="font13">the parishioners elect the priest, whereas in general all priests are appointed by the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At the Lambeth Conference in London in August this event in Denmark was not overlooked. A correspondent of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kristeligt Dagblad</span><span class="font13"> wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some of the resolutions discussed co-operation with the northern Lutheran churches and such discussions will continue. This is specially the case with the Lutheran churches of Norway, Denmark and Iceland and a closer co-operation will be the basis of negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a report concerning the discussions already held we are reminded of the “serious difficulty which has been occasioned by the recent ordination of three women priests in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Danish Church. We have been informed that seven of the nine bishops of Denmark were against this action and also that Bishop Fuglsang-Damgaard hopes that this is only a passing episode in the life of the Danish Church”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was not deemed necessary to mention this matter in the resolution. In reply to a question by </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kristeligt Dagblad's </span><span class="font13">correspondent the archbishop of Canterbury explained that the case is of a serious character but not so serious as to break off the discussions with the Danish and other northern churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It appears that during the war a woman was ordained in Hong Kong; so the Lambeth Conference declared in a resolution that a bishop cannot ordain a woman to any other service in the church than to service as a deaconess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The question of women priests was also thoroughly discussed in the Amsterdam meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE are only two persons in Germany “privileged” to call themselves “Leader”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One is Hitler, and the other is Baldur von Shirach, the leader of the Nazi Youth Movement. Both Hitler and Shirach are Roman Catholics. Goebbels, Roman Catholic, the minister of propaganda, the prime molder of Germany’s mind, was educated by the Jesuits. In 1923, when Hitler’s revolt in Bavaria failed, Goering fled to Rome. Later, in 1931, Goering was sent to Rome as Hitler’s envoy to the pope and Mussolini: “a mission,” says the German author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nasi?</span><span class="font7"> (a Nazi sympathizer), “which was highly important for the further progress of the National Socialist movement.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">I JESUIT CONTROL OF THE WORLD I | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—BY FASCISM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I It is difficult to popularize a tyranny, | | and, as everybody knows, the Roman I 1 Catholic hierarchy Is the most perfect ex- I 1 ample of tyranny the world has known, | 1 The job of the Jesuits Is to make it | | seem desirable, even necessary, that the | | government of mankind should be turned 1 I over to the Roman hierarchy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">| The curiously Interesting methods by | | which men are persuaded to put their | 1 worst enemies In control of their destinies | 1 are set forth In this article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">| The writer of the article, a university j | man of high standing, conceals his iden- | | tity under a nom de plume.

<p><span class="font4">| The article takes down the screens and I | lets the honest reader see Just how the I | Jesuits are planning world control by | 1 Fascism, and how they are succeeding. | | If liberty is lost, all is lost; and liberty | i is lost wherever the Jesuits succeed In I | forcing a dictator upon the people.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font7"> Hitler says: “After all, the only infallible touchstone for distinguishing right action from wrong is: visible success.” This makes Al Capone a saint until he was pinched. This is the Jesuitical “code” of morality upon which Nazism, and Hitler’s philosophy, is based. This somewhat prepares one for the following observation by one of Hitler’s semiadmirers, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">An Eyeivitness in Germany,</span><span class="font7"> page 78: “Adolf Hitler has with profound insight made use of the Roman propaganda’s many centuries of experience, and National Socialism’s whole organization betrays the papal hierarchy as its model.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler is a Roman Catholic, like every other European 'dictator’—the late Pilsudski, Mussolini, and Dollfuss. He acquired his anti-Semitism, so he says himself, from Lueger, a burgomaster of Vienna, a well-known anti-Semite preacher, and a “devout” Roman Catholic. In the story of the actual intrigues that made Hitler the chancellor of Germany there lies the truth about Nazism.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Made Chancellor by Papal Intrigue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and later “constitutional” dictator, purely and wholly by papist intrigue. Hitler was not made chancellor by popular vote or voice. He was called to the chancellorship by Hindenburg after von Papen had persuaded Hindenburg to dismiss Schleicher. This is well known. What is to be noted is that von Papen, like Hitler, is a Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is amazing how this has been forgotten in the rush of events since. Nazism rules in Germany today, thanks to von Papen. Democracy has been trampled on, the Jews beaten, Karl Ernst, Strasser, and Schleicher murdered, thanks to von Papen, the Vatican’s 'lay nuncio’ at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a matter of fact, von Papen, so-called “Nationalist”, and not Hitler, was Germany’s first Nazi dictator! Von Papen was chancellor before Schleicher. He, too, was “invited” to the chancellorship by Paul Hindenburg, without either parliamentary or public support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet this von Papen, whose party had won only 10 percent of the votes at the election, while he</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was chancellor in June, 1932, summarily “dismissed” and “forcibly removed” the Prussian cabinet led by the Labor ministers Braun and Severing, who had held office for ten years as heads of an efficient administration. This, a year before Hitler became chancellor, was the commencement of Nazism in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bruening was connected with the Catholic trade union movement. To use Walton Newbold’s words, he was “always cajoling the Social Democrats, more particularly their trade unions”. Elsewhere Newbold refers to “the Catholics of the German Centrum and their allies, the Social Democrats”. These quotations are from Newbold’s book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Democracy, Debts, and Disarmament.</span><span class="font7"> The papist chancellors Wirth, Marx, Bruening, and von Papen prepared Germany for Hitler; and the Social Democrats, stupidly enough, made themselves the “allies” of the Roman Catholic Centre Party whose vote later on made Hitler the “constitutional” dictator of Germany!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After being elevated to the chancellery, Hitler held a general election. He wanted to win two-thirds of the seats in the German Parliament in order to enable him to abolish it “constitutionally”, to vote itself out of existence.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>The “Election”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler obtained permission from Hindenburg to dissolve Parliament and to hold the election, but on condition that whatever the result the composition of the government was not to be changed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can you beat that ? Hitler was taking a chance to get supreme power, but he was not risking the loss of the power he already had!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No sooner had the “election” started than Goering got to work. He had newspapers suppressed for publishing a report that stock exchange prices had slumped. He prohibited the entire Social-Democrat (e.g., Labor) press from publishing a Social-Democrat manifesto!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this stage Goebbels was appointed to the newly created post of minister of propaganda. This gave Hitler control of broadcasting and cinemas, and of the press, through a system of censorship which Goebbels introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then six days before the date fixed for the election the Reichstag went up in flames. Does any common-sense person doubt for a moment that it was set on fire by Goering? The effect of the fire was stupendous; and Goering, Goebbels, and Hitler made the most of it. The Communists were accused of setting the Reichstag on fire, and the Socialists with “complicity”. Van der Lubbe was said to have confessed his crime and association with both Communists and Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the strength of this imbecile’s “confession” the official press agency announced throughout the length and breadth of Germany: “Through this confession the united Communist-Socialist front has become a palpable fact.” In the course of investigation it was stated several weeks afterwards that the Socialists had been entirely cleared from the charge of conspiracy in the crime.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Labor Press Squelched</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">On the strength of the fire scare, the entire Labor press, consisting of more than two hundred daily newspapers, was suppressed until further notice. During the last few days of the election Nazi speakers stumped the country accusing the “Marxists” of being murderers and incendiaries. Murderers? It is only non-murder-ous Nazis who coin words, or names, like “The Night of the Long Knife”. Hitler stood forth as the “bulwark” against those “Reds” who had dared to put a match to Germany’s citadel of Democracy, the Reichstag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still Hitler doubted the result. He wanted, understand, not merely a majority, but a two-thirds majority, the majority necessary for the temporary elimination of Parliament. Again Goering came to the rescue. Under cover of suppressing the “Red” danger, Goering obtained from Hindenburg a presidential decree which enabled him to establish an iron rule, first over Prussia, and then gradually to the other German states. Germany was put under “martial” Nazi law. Large internment camps were formed, and Communists, Socialists, Liberals, true Nationalists, intellectuals, state officials, etc., anybody and everybody suspected of anti-Nazism who could influence public opinion by pen, speech, or position, were thrown into them. The Labor branches throughout the country were kept in a riot of disorder by a series of raids carried out by Nazis who were practically free from official interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of all this force, suppression, quackery, jailing, and raiding, Hitler did not receive an absolute majority. Out of 647 seats, he obtained only 288. Compared with the previous elections of November 6, 1932, the Nazis had gained 38 seats, the Nationalists 1, the Roman Catholic Centre Party 4; the Socialists had lost 1 seat, and the Communists had lost 19. The Government Parties (e.g., Nationalists, 52, “Other Government Parties” 9, and Nazis 288) held a total of 349 out of 647 seats. What Hitler had wanted was a two-thirds majority to enable him “constitutionally” to eliminate Parliament. He failed to get this two-thirds majority. What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Reichstag met in the Kroll Opera House: Hitler introduced an “Empowering Bill” giving the Government complete and absolute power to rule without Parliamentary control. And the Roman Catholic Centre Party voted in favor of it 1 This gave Hitler his necessary “two-thirds” majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler became chancellor, thanks to the papist von Papen; and he became the “constitutional” dictator of Germany, thanks to the papist Centre Party.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Murders of June 30</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler’s next task was to remove from office in the party every sincere Nazi who could by his position or prestige influence policy, and who was not prepared to sell Germany, or betray it, to the general of the Jesuits. This was accomplished on June 30, when about 100 Brownshirt officers were massacred (by Blackshirts), and also a number of non-Nazi patriots were dealt with, such as General Duesterberg and General von Schleicher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">General Duesterberg, former deputy chief of the Steel Helmets, the German ex-Servicemen’s Association, was arrested on the night of June 30. (It was the practice of the Inquisition to make its arrests at nighttime.) He was first taken to Dachau concentration camp, and then to Colombia-Haus, Berlin. He was released on August 2, and said after his release: “I have not been shot, but I am a living corpse” (see Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font7"> August 30, 1934).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>June 30 and the Austrian Debacle</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Note the following facts:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(a) Nazi “disorders” broke out in Austria just a few days before the murders took place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(b) The murders happened a few days after Hitler’s return from Venice, where he had been discussing Austria with Mussolini.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(c) Among those murdered was Herr Rudolf Mai, former leader of the Nazi Storm Troopers (Brownshirts) in Upper Austria; also it was reported in the press that “many leading members of the Austrian Nazi Legion in Germany are said to be missing since the Hitler 'purge’ started on Saturday”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Put two and two together now, and you have the truth about the “Second Revolution”. The crime of Roehm, Heines, Ernst, Mai, etc., was that they believed in the Anschluss. They had preached it for years with Hitler: to them the “Third Reich” was the Anschluss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Roehm, Heines, Heydebreck, Ernst, and Mai, etc., had been living when the swastika went up in Vienna, they would have led the Brownshirts and the Austrian Nazi Legion in Germany into Austria. Mussolini’s meant nothing to them. They believed in 'Germany First’ and the Anschluss. Of course, this would have upset the whole “Black” (Popish) plot and the alliance of Germany and Italy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Leaders Bumped Off</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">This was one of Hitler’s main planks: the union of Austria with Germany. But this did not suit Mussolini, a power in the “Black International”; so, at Venice, Hitler agreed to give up the Anchluss idea, and instead to help Mussolini to “preserve” the “independence” of Austria. In other words, they would share Austria between them; but no Anschluss, because power might change hands in Germany. Knowing that this would create trouble in the Brownshirt ranks when it became known, Hitler “bumped” the Brownshirt leaders off before they had time to organize resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is surely perfectly obvious that these Brownshirt leaders were not expecting trouble. Roehm made the Brownshirt army. He was its organizer No. 1. Heines was a Ross-bach man, a leading Nazi terrorist. Men of this sort don’t wait to be slaughtered. They had met trouble before; but then they knew that it was coming to them. They weren’t killed for anything they had done, but for what it was expected they might do when they learned of Hitler’s “treason”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To General Daleuge was given the task of “cleaning up” the entire Nazi Brown Army after the June executions. He stated afterwards that “several thousand” leaders and men had been removed or subjected to disciplinary action. Then in the next breath we were told by Hitler that Captain Roehm had “no following”. Then why were those “several thousand” cashiered or removed ? The “purge” reached out over the whole of the Brownshirt organization. It altered its character completely. It left Popery in possession of “Nazism” and “on top” in Germany. Blackshirtism, Popish Fascism, rules Germany; Brownshirtism, or “true” Nazism, is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The murder of General von Schleicher had nothing to do with the other murders. He was murdered, and his wife also, because dead men (and women) tell no tales. He knew the whole intrigue that made Hitler chancellor; he was regarded as the chief menace to the popish plot to rule Germany under the name of “Nazism”. As stated by “Artego” in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Referee</span><span class="font7"> (Britain), July 8:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘Tn his conversations with Schleicher (when Roehm and Schleicher were conspiring to remove Bruening from the chancellorship) Roehm revealed to him certain secrets about the internal affairs of the National Socialist Party and about its leader. Altho’ Schleicher did not speak about those things confided to him, he allowed others to see that he was in possession of knowledge about the Nazi party and about Hitler the publication of which would have put Hitler in an unbearable position and ended his political career.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Pope Behind the Scenes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Broadcasting to Britishers on July 3, a Mr. Crossman, an eyewitness of the scenes during the Hitler murders, said that whenever he had spoken to the German people, from Munich to Berlin, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font7"> without exception, told him the same thing, i.e., that “the pope was behind the whole of the trouble”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To bear witness that the Nazi party was on the wane when the conspiracy which made Hitler chancellor took place, listen to the following accounts of eyewitnesses, a Russian social democrat, a biographer of Nazism, and a French Marxian Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kerensky, the famous Russian politician, and anti-Communist, says, page 321 of his book about Russia, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Crucifixion of Liberty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I was in Germany myself in December 1932, during the chancellorship of General von Schleicher. The Nazi influence was then plainly on the decline. In order to beat them finally it was only necessary to push the new chancellor’s experiment to its conclusion; in his internal policy he had the support of the central elements of every class in Germany . . . Instead of doing everything to support Schleicher, however, Hugenberg and von Papen turned to Hitler and almost pushed him into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The (anonymous) German author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nazi?</span><span class="font7"> says, pages 23, 89:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The intrigue which overthrew General von Schleicher and installed Hitler in his stead had been contrived, not by him, but by other forces . . . His (Hitler’s) movement had undoubtedly begun to decline and was showing signs of internal disunion. Baron von Papen, whose mediation had brought about the change of Government, was (made) vice-chancellor ... He publicly described the Hitler experiment as a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">detour </span><span class="font6">leading eventually to the ‘authoritative State’ which was his ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lost Two Million Votes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Henri Ernst, the author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hitler over Europe,</span><span class="font7"> says, pages 12,13:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of 1932 it (Nazi party) lost 2 million votes and the Strasser group announced its secession. In January 1933 Schleicher was on the point of hitting the Hitler movement on the head and putting it under his own command ... In the middle of January a secret meeting was held between Hitler and von Papen at Cologne . . . the news of the meeting got into the papers a few days later ... At this meeting Hitler came to an agreement with von Papen. In this way the sudden fall of Schleicher and the sensational nomination of Hitler came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This, from three sources, is the story briefly of how Nazism got into power. Hitler was not made chancellor as the result of a popular demand. Germany was not in wreck and ruin. He was not carried to the highest administrative post in the Reich on a swell of popularity for Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his Merttens lecture, 1934, “The Roots of Violence,” Mr. S. K. Ratcliffe said, with perfect truthfulness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The German people are profoundly anti-revolutionary. During the eight years marked at the end by her admission to the League of Nations, Germany had rebuilt her industries and her civic life, had overcome to a great extent the destructive influences in the national character, and by persistence in the policy of treaty fulfillment (afterwards so bitterly repudiated) had regained in great degree her international standing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There wasn’t an earthly chance of a Communist revolt. Nazism was a declining force. The German public had rejected the idea of violence. After thirteen years of turmoil, tolerance had triumphed, Germany was becoming Nationalist, progressive, and more thoroughly, and sensibly, democratic. Schleicher “was on the point of hitting the Nazi movement on the head”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Germany “Saved” for the Jesuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jesuits saw Germany, and their vision of the “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire”, slipping from their claws. “Down with Democracy! Down with Tolerance! Up Murder! Up Dictatorship!” Papen and Hitler &quot;saved” Germany for the Jesuits, just as Mussolini &quot;saved” Italy for the &quot;Holy Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Fascism” (meaning &quot;Nazism” too), wrote Ludendorff in his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming War,</span><span class="font7"> “is a fighting instrument of the pope.” “Fascism is the offspring of the Jesuits.” “The ways of the Church of Rome and Fascism are identical.” “The Papacy and Fascism are inseparably united : together they constitute what is called ‘Rome’.” “What astonishes me is that the fact should have been overlooked that national socialism of the Fascist type merely means collectivism of the Romish brand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks to the Jesuits, the old “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire” has virtually been revived in Central Europe. Thanks to the Dominicans (the “Inquisitor-General” is always a Dominican), the “Universal Inquisition”, known by the name of “Gestapo” in Germany and “Ovra” in Italy (i.e., the secret police), once more rules over Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Italian Peninsula. But it won’t be for long.</span></p>

According to his tale the favorite method of choking is with a towel wrapped around the neck and twisted. When a patient is to be pummeled in the stomach towels are wrapped around the pummeler’s fists, to save his knuckles, and also to make the pummelings resemble bruises received through falls. When a patient offends an attendant he is given the ice pack, by the doctor’s orders, and the anonymous writer says: “I’ve seen men who fought in mud all over France without flinching sob like a baby in a cold pack.” Bitterly, this man says: “Yes, I’ve been a patient in the most violent ward of a 700-patient hospital. Ninety percent of the violence I saw there was among the attendants, not the patients. I talked to many of the patients who had been in other hospitals, state institutions and private sanitariums. They all agreed that there is less brutality in the veterans hospitals. If that is true, I shudder to think what goes on in state institutions. I saw one man thrown by two attendants as you would throw a bag of grain. The fall broke his pelvis bone. Three days later he died of ‘pneumonia’. The two attendants are still on the job, or were over a year after it happened. . . . Because I have been a patient in a mental hospital I cannot secure employment of any kind. My wife must earn our living. . . . Where are the sob sisters ? Where are all those great humanitarians!

<p><span class="font6">Those who make a practice in the summertime of sleeping nude, with only the summer covers when any covers at all are necessary, report the greatest comfort and ease in being able to turn freely in the bed, and there is a saving in sleeping garments also.

<p><span class="font7">nTHE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vegetarian - Fruitarian - Humanitarian </span><span class="font7">calls attention to the fact that lettuce contains over 6 percent of potassium, over 1 percent of sodium, over 2 percent of calcium, over 1 percent of magnesium, iron about J of 1 percent, phosphorus nearly 2 percent, sulphur less than I/O of 1 percent, silicon H percent, and chlorine over 1 percent.

Burden, of Tennessee, tells about a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-L' </span><span class="font7">man who for experimental purposes lived on potatoes and nothing else for a year and a half, adding only a little vegetable fat. He worked hard and kept well, and his weight, strength and appetite did not decrease during all that time. It does not take a very big space to grow a ton of potatoes in your spare time, and 1500 pounds will supply one man with his food requirements for an entire year, except a moderate amount of fat or butter. Much of the food value of potatoes is lost by peeling them or by pouring off the water in which they are boiled. Bake the potatoes and eat the skin as well as the meat. Water in which potatoes have been boiled should be used for soups or broths. Never throw it away. Of course, the potatoes should be cleaned well before being cooked or baked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tomato is one of the richest vitamin foods. It is sometimes called the poor man’s orange. It contains more vitamins than oranges, especially vitamin A. This vitamin promotes growth, protects against infection, colds and sinus troubles. They are almost as good canned as when fresh. Put them up for use during the winter. Tomatoes do not cause rheumatism, as was once thought, and they are more highly alkaline than oranges in the effect on the blood, which is a desirable thing.</span></p>

My own experience with a pair of rayon hose recently may be explained also. Thousands of pimples broke out, beginning at the top of the hose and extending to the top of the foot. As for the “athlete’s foot” disease, I had suffered with that for some time, but in the above case my legs were affected. These pimples disappeared upon changing to white cotton socks, and such I expect to continue to wear.”</span></p>

She claims to be able to put 350,000 barefooted soldiers into the field in thirty days and to mobilize 900,000 troops, all together. It is still the law in Ethiopia to punish thieves by amputation of their hands. The war will start without mercy’s being shown by either side. The Italians are morally certain to win it in a few weeks, but may get a great surprise. All the talk about the Italians’ wanting to put an end to the Ethiopian slave trade is pure buncombe. Sir Samuel Hoare, British foreign secretary, said, in the House of Commons, “So far as my information goes, the Abyssinian government is doing its utmost to abolish the slave trade.” All there is about the war is that Italy is determined to have Ethiopia so that she can have an outlet for her surplus population, and keep them Italians. It is a clear case of robbery and murder, and the League of Nations hypocrites will cheer the robber and murderer and make it easy for him, and will do nothing for the native who wants to retain control of his own country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">TALY has been giving popular demonstrations of all known forms of bombs and poison gases. Ethiopia has laid in 1 ton of poison gas and 176 tons of munitions; which is nothing for a war with Italy. She has appointed an American professor of international law and a French professor of law to represent her at the preliminary peace conference; Italy is offended at this, for she had hoped to deal with Ethiopia direct. When the Italian troops began to pour into Africa the British hurried and, for $1,500,000, bought the right to a large part of the watershed of northwestern Ethiopia, for use in the Sudan. And this peeved the Italians, too. When Ethiopia found she could not buy munitions in France, Belgium, Denmark or Czechoslovakia, and that in some instances shipments already paid for were detained, the emperor said: “The Belgian government informed us this was to avoid the reproach of participation in the armament of the Ethiopian empire. Isn’t it a worse reproach to facilitate the accomplishment of Italy’s program of violation of treaties and coercion of a free people, weak in all resources except the justice of their cause? Is there one policy for the weak and another for the strong? The weak must be kept weak so that the strong may have no difficulty in destroying them.”</span></p>

The British government, that being one of its side lines, did not, of course, dare to raise any objections. But it is quite different with Ethiopia. The cabled “explanation” of why Ethiopia is denied the same privileges as were accorded Italy is as follows: “The British and French attitude is based on a special agreement among Britain, France, Italy and Ethiopia whereby Ethiopia agreed to limit the importation of arms except when it was ‘strictly necessary’. The Ethiopians also agreed that any shipments of arms into their country could be stopped in the event of war.” There you have it. Isn’t that rich? The whole world knows that Italy is about to wipe Ethiopia off the map. Under those circumstances it is not ‘strictly necessary’ for Ethiopia to arm in self-defense, and when the war starts she cannot arm, because the murderers are conscientious objectors to supplying arms to a weak nation attacked by a strong one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Christian burglar”. He is a Roman Catholic and sufficiently attached to the papacy that he has ordered the crucifixes to remain in every schoolroom in the country. He is out to steal th© land of Ethiopia, and has announced that the only thing that will prevent a war will be for the king, Haile Selassie, to ask Italy to assume an armed protectorate over the country. This brings up the whole question of etiquette toward burglars. Thus if some gang gathers at your front door and sends word in that they are going to murder you, burn your house and swipe all your valuables, the first thing to do is to find out if they are ‘‘bread-worshipers”, and if they are, and are well armed, the next thing is to ask them to come in and make themselves at home for the rest of their lives, and to petition them to assume an armed protectorate over the premises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">rederick T. Birchall, London correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> says: “It is generally understood that when the subject of recent Ethiopian conflicts came up in his conference with Pierre Laval last month, the French foreign minister gave the Italian premier a free hand to carry out any police operation he cared to undertake in that part of the world. No forceful interference from Great Britain is likely either.” What this means is that if Italy is strong enough to grab the new Ethiopian oil deposits she will get them, the same as Paraguay grabbed the oil fields of the Grand Chaco, and Japan grabbed the iron ore and coal mines of Manchuria. Some will wonder why the League of Abominations is silent while all this thievery is going on. But the League is only an international joke.</span></p>

Though less blasphemous, in Ethiopia it is perhaps more absurd. Pierre von Paassen, in a letter to the Atlanta </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Constitution, </span><span class="font7">says that every family of prominence has its own chaplain; morning devotions conducted by him last two hours. The family meanwhile remains standing, leaning on crutches. The poor have wooden crutches; the wealthy, gold and silver ones. Those in the religious racket seem to have the idea that the more foolish and unreasonable their claims and their methods, the bigger will be the crowds that follow them, and the more they will collect. That being the case, the pope would find a fine field in Ethiopia for his racket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">FRICAN travelers familiar with Ethiopia assert that it is one of the greatest natural fortresses in the world, and that Italy is cut off from it by almost inaccessible mountains and deserts. As a feature of its African campaign Italy has sent to the front, so it is said, three hundred thousand tons of steel rails. Among the Italian troops already in Africa drinking water is said to be selling at a dollar a bottle. Ethiopia claims to be able to put 80,000 cavalrymen, 20,000 trained infantrymen and 700,000 ordinary infantrymen into the field. The army has 1,000 machine guns, 200,000 spears and 100 pieces of artillery. All this, however, is nothing to what the Italians have. Italy’s airplanes are expected to be a great factor in the campaign.</span></p>

Of course, one could wish that this time the tables would be turned, but they probably will operate as usual and Ethiopia will pass out, with Italy, France, and Britain snarling over the carcass. Meantime Hitler may demand German colonies back.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">F A PERSON comes to your door bringing you a message of good news that makes you happy, you are pleased to receive that message. Today the earth is filled with strife, crime and suffering. The public press contains nothing but bad news. There is a company of men and women in the land that go from house to house carrying to the people a message of good news. They are called Jehovah’s witnesses. They are aiding the people to gain a knowledge of God’s provision for giving them everlasting peace on earth, and that knowledge will make you happy. Those men and women are properly called peace messengers. You should receive them gladly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the nations of earth are now in great distress and perplexity. No man has a remedy for the relief and comfort of the people. Jehovah God has a full and complete remedy for all the ills that afflict humankind. To all persons of good will God says (Matthew 12:18-21): ‘Behold my servant [Christ Jesus], my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: He shall bring judgment to the nations; and in His name shall the nations hope.’ Whatsover God speaks to the people is truth, as it is written in the Bible, His Word. He informs us in His Word that for centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world and has brought all manner of suffering and sorrow upon the peoples of the earth. Now the end of Satan’s rule is come and God by Christ will destroy wickedness and establish peace and prosperity on the earth. Nothing could possibly be of such interest, convenience and necessity to you as a knowledge of the truth of and concerning God and His kingdom which will bring to mankind boundless blessings. How can the people gain such knowledge unless someone tells them? The Lord has taken out from amongst men those whom He has made His witnesses, and now He sends them to the people to give information of and concerning His gracious provision for the blessing of mankind. These messengers come to you in peace with the unselfish motive of doing good unto you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long ago God caused faithful men to make a record of His prophecy, and that record is contained in the Bible. No man could compose or interpret that prophecy. By prophecy God foretold what would come to pass at the end of the world, where we now are. He has brought to pass the facts in fulfillment of prophecy, and by setting these facts alongside the divine prophecy any person may learn the truth and thus ascertain God’s purpose and manner of establishing a righteous government on earth for the blessing of mankind. These great truths are now published in book form so that you may take your Bible and together with these books gain a knowledge of God’s purpose, which you so badly need. Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to you these books that you may have opportunity to avail yourself of the information they contain. They are not selling books, but if you are able to contribute a small amount of money when receiving the books that money will be used to publish more books, and thus you will be enabled to have a part in sending this message of good news to other suffering ones of mankind that they may know how their relief is coming. A knowledge of God’s purpose toward men is of far greater value to you than all the gold of this world, and for that reason it is written, in Proverbs 18:15: “The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil is the invisible ruler of this wicked world, and he causes his representatives to prevent you from hearing the truth. He knows that the truth will cause those who love righteousness to turn to God, and for this reason his agents the clergy oppose Jehovah’s witnesses and the message they bring to you. Now a few selfish men control the land and hold mortgages on the farms and homes of the people, who are in constant fear of losing their homes. Such an unhappy condition will pass away under the reign of Christ, and then the people shall live in their homes without fear, as it is written (Psalm 37:11): “But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace”; and (Psalm 22: 26), “The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise the Lord that seek him; your heart shall live for ever.” Who are the “meek” mentioned in these texts? To be meek means to be anxious to learn the truth. The meek are those who seek to gain knowledge of God’s gracious provisions for mankind. Such knowledge you can gain only by studying the Word of God; and He has made it possible for you to gain such knowledge, by placing before you an explanation of His Word of truth. “Say among the [nations], that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.”—Psalm 96:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">W having records along, I asked permission to use their phonograph, but was told it was broken. However, the children had a method for playing it even though the spring was broken, and they did. At another home an elderly woman was grieving because her daughter-in-law had refused permission for her to tune in and hear Judge Rutherford on the radio. I came along with the phonograph records, played for her the record ‘Jehovah’, and she said, ‘Oh, I love the name of Jehovah.

In another home a Catholic-raised boy staying with his grandparents said, ‘I am not a Catholic. Do you know that the Catholics are trying to get the power to persecute?’ He also was glad to hear the records.

<p><span class="font7">J. w’s who team together in the service experienced the following in connection with the petition work. At a fine home an elderly Jewess answered the door, flew into a rage when she saw the petition, called the J.w. hard names and bid her be gone. As the worker turned to go the husband appeared at the door and said: ‘Vait a minute, lady, vait; don’t go avay. Mama, don’t you know dot ve heard on the radio dis mornink dot dis ladee vould be here vit a petition vot ve should sign ? Come in, lady. Sit down. How is Chudge Rooterford? how is his bealt?

I believe in free speech for everybody except that damned Judge Rutherford. I wish he was in hell.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At a fine large house no one answered. Perhaps the bell was out of order. Going around to the rear, a lady was sitting outside. Looking the petition over she said, ‘I don’t understand this; I’ll go in and see father.’ In a few minutes she returned without the petition. Immediately following her was a big fat priest, with the petition in his hand! Oh! Oh! Glp! What now? Another priest was immediately back of him. The fat one then read it aloud. ‘H’m! This is all right. Sure! Wait a minute! We’ve got a big meeting on; I’ll get some more names for you.’ He returned the petition with the names of 37 priests added.”—F. W. W., Colorado.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N THIS issue is presented a report of a transcription meeting conducted at Accra, Gold Coast, West Africa, by W. R. Brown, accredited representative of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. The Devil, ably assisted by the missionaries, did everything he could to interfere. Though Brown was born a British subject (in the West Indies), and had credentials signed by Judge Rutherford and countersigned by the London office, and though he had previously been received with courtesy by the officials at Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Conakry and Dahomey, some unseen and unknown force persuaded the police to force Mr. Brown to deposit £60 in cash, to guarantee that he would not become a public charge, before he was allowed to give his lecture. The native press was very outspoken about this unkind and unnecessary act; also about hoodlums’ throwing stones on the roof where 3,000 people were trying to hear the lecture. It may be set down as certain that the missionaries were at the bottom of this. Several of them were in the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">War in the Clouds, Warns Judge Rutherford in Talk</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3,000 Listen to Lecture on Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaker Condemns Policy of Leading Powers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A fully packed house heard Judge J. F. Rutherford speak on the subject of “Universal War Near’’ through a high-powered transcription machine at the Palladium, Accra, on the evening of Sunday. W. R. Brown, a representative of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, formerly the International Bible Students Association, under whose auspices the lecture was given, conducted the meeting. The audience, which was estimated at 3,000, included some clergymen from other denominations and adherents of churches with different religious dogmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JUDGE RUTHERFORD SPEAKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lecture was preceded with the singing of the popular hymn “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name’’ by massed voices at 7:30 p.m. Before this time there was no elbow room in the very spacious hall. After the hymn Judge Rutherford set the ball of his lecture a-rolling in clear intonation through the machine; but owing to the great attendance and the noise outside made by the many people who could not gain admission into the hall, the voice of the lecturer was drowned and was inaudible to many, who were thus deprived of the advantage of closely following the substance of the lecture, which took about fifteen minutes to deliver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MR. BROWN EXPOSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the audience was not disappointed. After the delivery through the machine, Mr. Brown mounted the platform to clarify and amplify certain points in the lecture. He said that by “Universal War Near’’, the title of the lecture, was meant the clouds which are at present gathering on the political horizon in Central Europe, and are threatening the peace of the world. Like the rain storm, the clouds would burst on the people and the whole universe would be caught in that gruesome cataclysm, the like of which had never been known in the history of mankind, and then the end of the present era would have come. A few people would survive. Satan, who was liberated to interfere in world’s affairs after the war of 1914-18 and had been active ever since, would be destroyed, and the Kingdom of God established on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LEAGUE OF NATIONS DOOMED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The League of Nations was prophesied in the Scriptures. It was referred to as “the abomination of desolation” in the Bible. It was the Devil’s organization </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font6">the earth and would live but for a short time. There was no truth in the statement that the League of Nations was the expression of God’s Kingdom on the earth. Scriptures were definite that the purposes of the League of Nations were to the contrary. No amount of Hague conferences, Locarno pacts or Versailles treaties would give peace to the world; peace would be established in the world only after the great Armageddon, which some of the Bible students believed would commence a year or two hence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHURCH BOWS TO STATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church was one of the Devil’s organizations on the earth. The lecturer, to lend weight to his contention, referred his hearers to what he considered the very regrettable incident which took place in England when the question of the revision of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Common Prayer Book</span><span class="font6"> was before the British Parliament. He said, according to the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font6"> the then prime minister stated in the debate on the question that the church was for the state. The then archbishop became indignant at this statement and contended that the church was a different organization from the state. But when Parliament declared that it would withhold its financial assistance from the church if the archbishop was serious, he (the archbishop) withdrew his statement ignominiously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRIESTS KILL ONE ANOTHER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy were garbed in the cloak of hypocrisy. During the Great War, they divested themselves of their ecclesiastical accouterments, slung rifles on their shoulders, and took part in killing one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BUT PREACH LOVE YOUR ENEMIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But after the war they reinvested themselves with their canonicals, mounted the pulpits and denounced the killing of humanity, and said by way of admonition: “Love your enemies.” [Loud laughter and long applause.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concluding his lecture, Mr. Brown said that the impending Armageddon would free humanity from the cruel grip of all the Devil’s organizations on the earth; the Kingdom of God, for which the people had always prayed to come, would be established on the earth; and Christ the Eleet of God would be the Emperor of the world, and would rule the people with love, justice and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lecture was punctuated here and there with thunderous applause, especially whenever Mr. Brown easily explained a knotty point in a Scriptural passage whose meaning was obseure to the auditory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Brown’s exegesis was a masterpiece, and he sent his large audience back to their homes well satisfied, and with enough food for reflection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lecture lasted about one hour and a half.— Accra (West Africa) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gold- Coast Spectator.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">EALIZING that Jehovah’s witnesses are visiting every home in the land repeatedly with the message of God’s kingdom as the one and only hope of mankind, the Protestant churches are getting together in an attempt to provide work for unemployed preachers, and to prevent the people from learning the truth. They will try to put on thousands of trailer-type coaches, equipped with microphones and amplifiers, to imitate Jehovah’s witnesses. An appeal for funds to keep the coaches on the move is now being made in the name of the American Inland Mission. It seems not to have occurred to them, however, that the use of microphones, amplifiers and other sound equipment presupposes that the users have something to say, and the usual vacuities of preachers will hardly serve the purpose.

<p><span class="font7">*<sup>&lt;r</sup>pHE New Jersey sound car took up a position in front of the city hall, Plainfield, N. J., at 7: 45 p.m., Thursday, June 6. The car’s four five-foot trumpets blazed away for about two minutes with a message concerning Jehovah God and His witnesses and their imprisonment. Two police cars surrounded the sound car, arrested the five witnesses who were in it and put them in jail, charged with operating a sound car without a permit from the police. Inasmuch as there were five in the car, the police do not know the identity of the operator and do not know who made the announcement. The burden of proof is with the strong-arm squad, and it will be interesting to see how they will meet it. The New Jersey sound car is a babe as yet, not officially seven days old, yet it has been approached by 14 police officials at nine different points, six times has been stopped from operating, and twice has been confiscated, and taken away from us. ‘If my kingdom were of this world, than would my soldiers fight.’ Happy are we to fight for the kingdom of Jehovah. The operation of the sound cars at Washington was an eye-opener, and the New Jersey division has visions of a fleet of 25 such cars. Shall they not drink of the cup which Jehovah has poured? They shall. We see the continued favor of Jehovah upon Brother Eutherford. His zeal for the King greatly refreshes us. The spiritual food is timely, and without it we eould not survive. May God’s holy angels direct him and direct us for His name’s sake, is our prayer.”—D. E. M., New Jersey.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE pastor of a Baptist church in Australia was asked by four out of five of his official board to resign. The reason for wanting him to quit was that he stopped preaching from the Bible and regaled the people with sermons on Hitler and Doctor Angus and what not. But he did not relish losing his job. Then somebody, possibly the preacher himself, threw a bomb into camp by painting on the inside of the church, in red letters a foot high, and twelve feet off the floor, the word “Ichabod”. That means, “The glory of the Lord has departed from this place.” The official board thought they would be suspected. One of them tried to wash out the letters, but they would not wash. Then he tried to cover them with a strip of calico. Between the morning and evening services they managed to obliterate the offending word. A good time was had by all.</span></p>

Seedtime and harvest have never failed, yet penury and want stalk throughout our land. The Giver of all good has given to His world in abundance to feed and clothe His people, yet thousands go unfed and thousands are in need of proper raiment”. One would think, since Mr. Greenshields admits he has no remedy for this complete debacle of the interest or capitalist system, that he would be ready to listen to those who come to him with the message of God’s kingdom, or, at any rate, would listen to the arguments of those who believe in Silvio Gesell’s “hot money”, or Major Douglass’ social credit proposals. But Mr. Greenshields and his friends do not want to give up the failing capitalist system without one last determined effort to keep the current of interest still flowing. And the last stand of the capitalist system is the Roman Catholic Fascist system, as now being worked out in practice by Mussolini, Hitler, Schuschnigg, and other clerks.</span></p>

Still they are learning something, anyway. One of Jehovah’s witnesses found fifteen of them at Maplewood police headquarters listening to a WBBR (Watchtower) true life radio drama picturing police court conditions in Maplewood, and they sure learned something, if they listened to the end.

<h3><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>“National Union for Social Justice”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE so-called “National Union for Social Justice” now calls itself the National Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Its spokesman, Charles E. Coughlin, at Madison Square Garden, New York city, addressed an audience estimated at 20,500, calling for political action of the Union, but distributed between the various political parties. The Union, in each district, will consider the various candidates, and vote accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Coughlin was dressed in clerical garb. Twice in his address he labeled Pope Pius XI as “the greatest churchman of the age”. The indications are plain that the Roman Catholic hierarchy, having taken over the Democratic party, body and soul, now aims to take possession of the Republican party, and will use Mr. Coughlin and his “National Union” as the fisherman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his address Mr. Coughlin gave some interesting information, quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1919 we had in the United States of America 274,402 manufacturing establishments. By 1927— eight years later—despite our increase in population and our increase in exports, these manufacturing establishments decreased by 30 percent, leaving only 191,866 manufacturing plants in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These figures prove to you that there was a tendency toward monopolization, that business as conducted in this nation was programed and geared only for the few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was fast becoming a grim reality that in the United States there was no place for the small business man. Only that plant which was associated with a large banking house could secure loans to purchase labor-saving machinery. The little industrialist who refused to sell his birthright and share his profits, not with the laborer but with the banker, gradually was being eased out of industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1919 these manufacturing plants employed 9,039,171 wage earners. Eight years later this wageearning group was reduced to 8,349,735. Here again we find, despite our increased population and exports, fewer laborers were required—a decrease of 689,436.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the prosperous year of 1929 industries upon which 40 percent of our wage earners depended for a living employed 900,000 fewer wage earners than they did in 1919, although the 1929 production was 50 percent greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 the value of the products manufactured in our industrial establishments was approximately $24,-000,000,000. In 1921 this value increased to $44,000,-000,000. In 1923 it skyrocketed to $60,000,000,000. While in 1929 it reached the stupendous figure of $69,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only was power concentrated in the hands of fewer industrialists; not only did our population increase by more than 25,000,000 persons; not only did the wealth produced by these industrialists increase by almost 300 percent; the astounding and frightful figure associated with all this is that there was a steady devastating decrease in employment and in wages also. The more business carried on, the fewer wages were paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As far as the wage decrease, which accompanied the wealth increase, is concerned, let us put these official figures on the books of our memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1923, when modern capitalism was in bloom, the total volume of wages paid to workingmen in the manufacturing industries was $11,007,000,000. In 1929, when the annual value of our manufactured products had increased $9,000,000,000 over the 1923 total, the volume of wages in the manufacturing industries was still approximately $11,000,000,000.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>Divine Inspiration of the Bible</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE divine inspiration of the Bible is today attacked from various standpoints. The opposition to and denial of its claims of divine inspiration come from a quarter from which we might, humanly speaking, least expect it. Among those who have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">apparently</span><span class="font7"> given many years of study to Biblical writings there are many who reject the claim that it is the Word of God, and thus undermine its influence. These professors, teachers, students and what not, really exalt their own wisdom above that of the Scriptures. They claim that present-day enlightenment is m advance of the Bible. While they do not always state the case as plainly as that, such is nevertheless their position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Objection to the Bible as divinely inspired is based upon the following propositions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They claim that the Bible does not agree with science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They hold that its historical data do not correspond with the inscriptions found upon some ancient monuments and temples, particularly those of Babylon and Assyria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They say that the Bible contains things that are indelicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They assert that there are contradictions in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They state that there are things in the Scriptures that seem foolish and unintelligible, and hold that this is folklore or mythology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In answer to the objection that “the Bible does not agree with science’’, it is pointed out that this does not necessarily prove the Bible to be wrong. The Bible is not a treatise upon science. Science has to do with material things. The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of things that could not otherwise be known. It tells of God’s purposes toward His earthly creation, as well as telling of other creatures and their part in His universal organization. It gives important information as to what is acceptable to God and of what His service consists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where the Bible deals with natural phenomena and material things it will be found that its statements are in harmony with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">proven </span><span class="font7">theories of science. Statements which appear to contradict what science has shown to be true will be found to be figurative or symbolical. Thus, when The Revelation tells of “four angels standing on the four corners of the earth”, there is no thought of either a flat or a square earth. It is a symbolical statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much of what is called science, on the other hand, is nothing of the kind. Unfounded statements are often made, and unwarranted deductions drawn. True science does not conflict with a proper understanding of the Bible. Frequently statements of Scripture are found which become very significant in the light of the discoveries of science. For instance, while it was certainly unknown in Job’s day that the earth is round, one finds in the book of Job the statement that God “hangeth the earth upon nothing”. (Job 26:7) Compare that with the silly notion of the “wise” Greeks of ancient times who believed that the earth was upheld by someone called Atlas. The statement in Job must have been difficult to appreciate until true science revealed that the earth is an immense ball whirling through space and actually ‘hung upon nothing’. The Bible is away ahead of science, as its remarkable account of the creative epoch-days abundantly proves.—Genesis 1.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>Were the Ancient Monuments Reliable?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">As to the claim that there are discrepancies between the historical tables and monuments, on the one hand, and the Bible, on the other: This is readily admitted. But why conclude that it proves the Bible untrue ? Is it not more probable that it proves the monuments and tablets of the ancient heathen nations to be false? Consider how the Bible has been preserved, while every vestige of the literature, if any, of ancient Babylon has been lost, with the exception of some clay tablets. Truth was not the big objective with the heathen kings. They were interested in glorifying themselves. The crude inscriptions on monuments and buildings, which are pointed to as invalidating Scripture testimony, are hardly worthy of comparison with the Scriptures. The kings, generals and priests of heathen nations had no scruples about being dishonest, and dressed the facts to suit their purposes. The writers of the Bible, on the contrary, were men who often braved persecution and death in their stand for righteousness and truth. The constant effort of the Israelites was to preserve the Scriptures inviolate. The monuments and tablets with their crude inscriptions, therefore, should be given no weight against the testimony of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, object the higher critics, the Bible has contradictions. An examination of these claimed contradictions shows a failure to bear in mind the main teachings of God’s Word, and they</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">manifest as well an unwarranted eagerness to find contradiction where there is none. The fact, for instance, that the four writers of the gospels record similar events in somewhat different language is taken as evidence of “contradiction”, while the reasonable and proper view would appreciate these slight divergencies as evidence of the truthfulness of the different narrators, showing that there was no collusion on their part to tell a plausible story.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark243"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>As to Indelicacies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">As to those things in the Bible, and they are few, which seem “indelicate”: Niceties of speech are not necessarily an indication of purity of heart, nor is plain speech a proof of the reverse. The Bible is written for mature minds, and not for the immature, although children are greatly blessed by instruction drawn from its contents. It certainly cannot be said that the Bible condones impurity. Its influence is in the opposite direction as respects those who sincerely study its pages. The Bible, however, records without varnish, as well as without partiality, the failings as well as virtues of the individuals which appear in its historical parts. This should give us greater confidence in the accuracy and honesty of the Scriptures, rather than less. As it gives us examples of righteousness and faithfulness, it also gives examples of that which is wrong and to be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to those things in the Bible which are unintelligible or which seem foolish to some: No doubt an advanced study in algebra appears foolish to those who have not studied that science. So also the more advanced parts of other branches of knowledge. The Bible, too, has the simpler truths for the beginner and the more difficult themes (such as The Revelation) for those who are farther advanced; that is, it has “milk for babes” and “strong meat” (solid food) for the more mature. The Word of God requires study, and patient study. Only those who are earnestly desirous of knowledge and understanding will find the “treasures of wisdom and knowledge”. The critical, the superficial and the unbelieving will not be privileged to appreciate God’s purposes. “Light [truth] is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.”—Psalm 97:11.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark245"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>The Modernist a False Friend</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing covers the reply to the general objections raised to belief in the Bible as inspired. There is, however, another kind of opposition leveled against the Word of God which is more insidious, coming from a class of men that is highly esteemed. This class is composed of “leaders in religious thought”. These profess to believe in a sort of half-inspiration. This attitude is more destructive of faith in the Word of God than any direct denial of its claims to inspiration. The modernist is a false friend of the Scriptures. He assumes an air of superiority that often amounts to the most palpable conceit. Pointing to their great learning as a class they claim to be in position to tell what parts of the Bible are to be accepted as “authentic”. They will concede that some parts of the Bible are 'fairly good’, and that the inspiration which prompted the writing of those passages was similar to th’e “inspiration” which results in an author’s accomplishing the writing of a good book or the production of a fine painting on the part of a painter. Quite differently does the Bible speak of its inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would have been the highest presumption if the prophets and writers of the Bible had followed the course which higher critics and modernists say they did. These “wise men” tell us that the prophets and other writers of the Bible, fired by a zeal for the right as they saw it, were very bold in speaking and writing, and claimed that what they wrote was not their own writing, but that of God. The modernists tell us that the prophets merely attached God’s name to their own ideas to give their writings and warnings greater weight. They further tell us that the writings of Isaiah, Daniel and others of the prophets were produced by altogether different individuals, who palmed off their own writings as the production of some of the great men who lived in previous ages. Wonder where the modernists get their information. Wonder, too, how they can call this “inspiration” in any sense whatever. A strange zeal for the right must have prompted the prophets, did one accept the modernist view of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the apostle John says, “No lie is of the truth.” What can it be called but lying, if any individual, no matter what the motive, should say, “Here is a writing from a great prophet, the great Daniel, and see, he foretells thus and so,” if all the time he knew that he was falsifying. A peculiar kind of righteousness! Yet, nothing less than this is held up to view in modernist literature, garbed in beautiful phrase, but undermining meanwhile both faith in God and every proper conception of truth and righteousness. To such, and other perverters of His Word, God says, “What hast thou to do, to declare my statutes, and that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.”— Psalm 50:16,17.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>The Bible’s Own Testimony</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The importance of the words of God to man is indicated in the significant statement in Deuteronomy 8: 3, “Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of [Jehovah] doth man live.” It is of greatest importance, therefore, to realize that the words of the Scripture are indeed the word of God and not the w’ord of man. That they are in the most definite and literal sense the words of God is made clear by the statements of a number of the writers of the books of the Bible. Take note how plainly they state that the things they wrote and taught were not in any sense of their own production. We find Moses saying with eloquent simplicity, “The Lord hath sent me to do </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.” (Numbers 16: 28) In these words he flatly contradicts the bold statements of the modernists to the effect that the writers of the Bible were merely expressing their own convictions. Not only does </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span><span class="font7"> disclaim </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font7"> kind of inspiration, but the same is true of other writers of the Bible. Note the statement of the apostle Peter (2 Peter 1: 20, 21): “No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy [spirit].” Note that he says ‘prophecy came not by the will of man’, by merely human will. The prophets were guided by the holy spirit. In another translation (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font7"> the twentieth verse reads, “But, above all, remember that no prophecy in Scripture will be found to have come from the prophet’s own prompting; for never did any prophecy come by human will, but men sent by God spoke as they were impelled by the holy spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophets did not originate what they wrote or said. Very frequently these teachers and proclaimers of God’s messages spoke contrary to their merely human inclinations; but, being moved by the holy spirit of God, they spoke boldly and plainly, though they often had to endure much suffering and persecution as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have as an example the prophet Jeremiah, who, when called of God to speak to Israel, demurred, pleading that his youth and inexperience made him a poor instrument. He said, “Ah! Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.” (Jeremiah 1: 6) He felt that the people would be unwilling to accept God's message from one so young; but the Lord encouraged him. Jeremiah then did as he was told, speaking in public places. Being derided and persecuted he for a time kept silence, but not for long. The words which God had entrusted to him ‘were in his heart as a burning fire shut up in his bones’, and so he proceeded with the work of giving to the disobedient nation the unwelcome message of coming disaster. While fulfilled upon Israel in miniature, his message has a wider application at “the end of the world”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark249"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>A Definite Commission</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">From a reading of the prophetic books, which have a fulfillment in this day as well as in the days of Israel, it is most evident that the prophets had a very definite commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ezekiel says, “The word of the Lord came </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">expressly</span><span class="font7"> unto Ezekiel the priest.” God said to him, “Thou shalt speak </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font7"> words unto them.” (Ezekiel 1:3; 2:7) Ezekiel was one of the few priestly prophets. He was honored as a spokesman of the Lord not merely because he was a priest, but because he was a faithful Israelite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hosea’s prophecy begins with the statement, “The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea.” The book of Joel begins in a similar manner. Amos says, “Thus saith the Lord,” and Obadiah uses the same expression. Others use words which with equal plainness show that they wrote, not out of the abundance of their own imaginations, but at God’s behest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In some instances we find that God made use of instruments which were made to deliver His message in spite of themselves. Thus he used Balaam, who, like preachers today, had an eye for business and who was quite willing to curse the people of God if he could only get permission. But he was obliged to deliver the Lord’s word unchanged. So he said to Balak, who tried to buy him, “I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak.”—Numbers 24:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophet Jonah, though not after the money, as was Balaam, was nevertheless inclined to consider his own honor a little mor© than God’s honor and the advancement of His purposes. He tried to evade the responsibility laid upon him, and had to be summarily dealt with. He was handled rather roughly, but learned the needed lesson and did as he was told. Having once accepted the duties of the prophet’s office he was held to the agreement. His personal inclinations could not be permitted to interfere with God’s purpose, for his own good as well as for the vindication of God’s name. There is a lesson here for those of God’s professed servants W’ho shrink from proclaiming unpopular truths.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark251"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>God’s Word Came Through</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">All these examples show that God's Word came through the way He wanted it to be delivered, whether His instruments were so disposed or not. Other Scriptural statements still more directly tell us that the Bible is the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter says, “But the word of the Lord endur-eth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” (1 Peter 1:25) Then he says, “The prophets . . . prophesied of the grace that should come unto you . . . unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy [spirit] sent down from heaven.”—1 Peter 1:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul states, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness ; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Timothy 3:16,17) He therefore advises Timothy, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” He also states under inspiration, “The word of God is quick and powerful, ... a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12) He further likens the word of God to a sword with which the servant of the Lord is able to route his enemies.—Ephesians 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be a surprise to those who have not given the matter careful study to note how continually the Scriptures claim divine inspiration and authority. Psalm 119:103 expresses the sentiment of those who have come to truly appreciate the Scriptures. “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!’’ In the same Psalm is the statement, “The entrance of thy words giveth light.” (Verse 130) Further, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Verse 105) The entire 119th Psalm is eloquent testimony to the inspiration of the Bible, particularly the portion of it then known to David. Other parts of the Scriptures subsequently written are declared to be inspired quite as emphatically by other witnesses of the Lord. Proverbs 30: 5 declares, “Every word of God is pure”; and the 19th Psalm gives us this beautiful passage: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: the ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: in keeping them there is great reward.” (Verses 7-11, A.ILF.) There is nothing indefinite or ambiguous about these words.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark253"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>Jesus’ Own Testimony</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, and conclusively, we have Jesus’ own testimony to the fact that the Scriptures are the Word of God. His continual reference to them is proof of His confidence and faith in their inspiration. Indeed, with Him it was more than belief: it was knowledge. He </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">knew</span><span class="font7"> that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and so testified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking to the religious leaders of His day, He said, “Ye have not [God’s] word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me.” (John 5: 38, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font7">If the Scriptures which were written centuries before Jesus came to earth spoke of Him, it surely proves most conclusively that they were the inspired words of God. Jesus further said, “Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?” (John 5:46,47) It was His perfect harmony with the Word of God that gave Jesus’ own words the power that even His enemies could not gainsay. Of Him it is said, “His word was with power.” ‘He spake with authority.’ “Never man spake like this man.” “[They] wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.”—Luke 4:32; Mark 1:22; John 7:46; Luke 4:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In His temptations Jesus rebuffed the adversary with quotations from the Word of God; in His preaching He constantly appealed to it; in His controversy with His opponents lie silenced them by referring them to the same authority, and in His hours of sorrow He drew comfort from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As already stated, the most honored of Jesus’ disciples give unquestionable testimony to the effect that the Scriptures are the Word of God. Since they were most familiar with Jesus’ own attitude toward these writings, they reflect that attitude in their own course of action, as well as being guided by inspiration to bear testimony to the truth of the Bible’s divine inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the foregoing proofs of inspiration, remarkable as they are, constitute only a part of the vast amount of evidence on this subject that is impressed upon the mind when the depth and scope of the purposes of the gracious Creator as set forth in the Bible are increasingly appreciated through faithful “searching”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>Advice from “Silent Unity”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">“0ILENT UNITY” seems to be about as bad as the more audible kind. It gives the following advice and “information” in one of its booklets. “Silently repeating statements of truth is a form of prayer. ‘Concentration,’ ‘affirmation,’ ‘meditation,’ ‘holding the thought,’ ‘speaking the word,’ and ‘going into the silence’ are terms having exactly the same meaning as ‘prayer<sup>1</sup>. ... [!] Go where you will be alone. Sit in a comfortable position and relax your entire body. For the time being, dismiss all other thoughtsand considerations from your mind and give your entire attention to the work in hand. . . . Begin your prayer by repeating, silently or aloud, the truth statement or affirmation in our letter to you, or inclosed in the envelope in the form of a printed leaf or card. . . . Please sign your name the same way in each letter. . . . Give in a few words the apparent condition, and mentally deny the error as you write.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here we have the system by which “Unity” works. The idea is to “pray” by “affirming </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">truth&quot;,</span><span class="font7"> which is accomplished on the same principle as when writing about your condition you mentally </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">deny</span><span class="font7"> “the error” as you write. Thus when you write “Unity” about your kidney trouble, you think as you write that you have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font7"> kidney trouble though you are telling “Unity” that you have kidney trouble. Can anything be simpler. You are affirming </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;truth&quot;</span><span class="font7"> and not kidding yourself, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When you “go into the silence” or “hold the thought” you are “praying” to ‘the “god” w’ithin you’, which “god” evidently is quite in harmony with the falsification. He could be no other than “the god of this world”, about whom the Word of the true God tells us in 1 Corinthians 4:4. This god, or one of his helpers, evidently has a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font7">chance to “get inside of you” while you are entirely relaxed and thinking of nothing but denying what is actually a fact’; otherwise why all this bother about something that does not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then “Unity” concludes with, “For the benefit of those who are unable to decide the amount of their offerings, we say, Ask the Spirit to show you. Silently affirm: ‘Infinite wisdom guides me in all my ways.’ Keep your mind open and receptive to the guidance that comes intuitively from within, and you will be shown what to do. Many of those who have been helped through Unity have adopted the tithing plan in order to show their love and gratitude. As a result, these friends are not only remembering our work liberally, but they are, in turn, being blessed with constantly increasing prosperity. Information as to tithes and tithing will be furnished on request.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, isn’t that just wonderful! You “hold the thought” and “Unity” will hold the tithes. Sweet of them, don’t you think ? But, to those who are too honest to affirm as truth what is untrue, and who are unwilling to deny that God </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font7"> all this is as plainly of the Devil as anything could be, and such will recall the words of real truth to the effect that in the last days some will give heed “to lying spirits”. Undoubtedly the Devil and his assistants will give some prosperity to those who fall into this trap; but could anything compensate for the tremendous loss that results to those who thus let go of their integrity toward God?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">F YOU are a subscriber for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine you will have received a heart-cheering letter from J. F. Rutherford, president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. This letter sets out the importance of the World-wide Praise Period which begins shortly, that is, October 5. Among other things of real interest, he stated, “Armageddon is near, and we must bestir ourselves in the interests of the King’s business. Fully united under the leadership of Christ Jesus you are invulnerable to the attacks of the enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One who is acquainted with the truth, has a knowledge of God’s purposes, will without equivocation say, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font7"> will be a publisher in the World-wide Praise Period.” And now we ask, Have you made arrangements for the witnessing October 5-13? In order to have a part in this special period you should obtain 50 booklets, on a contribution of only $1.00, which amount, of course, will be used in the printing of more publications. A special packet is arranged, and for your convenience a coupon is set out below which will, on receipt of your order, bring to you at an early date the literature for this World-wide Praise Period. During this nine-day witness you can call on your neighbors and friends and other people who live in your vicinity. Present them the testimony card which is furnished, introducing the booklets. It offers the three booklets on a contribution of 10c, or, if you should meet one who is interested and cannot contribute this amount, you may present the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font7"> booklet on a contribution of 5c. Or, if necessary and you feel so disposed, leave it with him free and ask him to pass it on to someone else after reading it. You may be assured that you will receive a rich blessing for the doing of this Kingdom work. It will be a glory to Jehovah’s name and bring joy to your heart. In order that you may make immediate preparations, the coupon below is provided.</span></p>

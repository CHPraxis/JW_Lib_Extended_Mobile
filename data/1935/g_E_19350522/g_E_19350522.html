<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Gideon’s Troops on New Jersey and Other Battle Fronts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">L</span><span class="font11">ET us hope it is not the final decision, but, at the moment, New Jersey, by one of its highest constituted authorities, has decided against Almighty God and definitely refuses to let His people freely worship Him as they desire and as He commands them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the summer of 1934 three of Jehovah’s witnesses, one man, two women, were preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom from house to house in Maplewood, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They were arrested because they had not first asked for and obtained a police permit to do their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Why not apply for a permit? For the sole reason that Jehovah God is supreme and He has commanded them to do this witness work; and to ask a permit of men to do what God has commanded would be not only inconsistent but a violation of their obligation to Jehovah. Like the apostles, they say: of that high tribunal. Those three justices are Perskie (a Hebrew), Trenehard (ar Protestant), and Heher (a Roman Catholic). Trenehard was occupied in the Hauptmann-Lindbergh case on January 16, 1935, when the case of Jehovah’s witnesses was opened for argument before Part 2 of the Supreme Court; hence only two of the three justices heard the argument. Then the two justices took the ease under advisement. In the middle of April they gave their decision. It is summed up in the concluding paragraphs of the written opinion, here quoted:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I On Thursday, May 2, 1935, there were mailed at | 1 Paterson, New Jersey, 6,500 letters, to every home in | I Maplewood, New Jersey, each containing a copy of 1 I the statement which appears on pages 516-517 of this | | Issue of THE GOLDEN AGE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| These letters also contained an Invitation to the | f people of the city to listen to a special Watch Tower | | broadcast of direct interest to Maplewood taxpayers, | f to be given at 9 a.m. Sunday, May 5. The postmaster | | at Paterson gave assurance that these letters would f | all be delivered before Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">f Perhaps at that time Postmaster General Farley had 1 | not yet had time to consult Amleto Giovanni Cicognani | 1 (archbishop and &quot;pope's” personal representative at | | Washington) as to his duties in the premises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| At any rate, by Sunday morning only a very few of | | those letters had been delivered, and the Maplewood £ 1 postal clerks admitted that practically all of the letters | | were still lying in that post office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| Accordingly, 190 of Gideon’s valiant troops covered i | &nbsp;the city that same day with great care, inviting every</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;householder to listen to the same broadcast, which</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark15"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1 &nbsp;was repeated at 4: 30 p.m. While thus engaged, they</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1 &nbsp;placed 1,410 books and booklets, In 517 homes. One</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;man and one woman were thrown into prison for doing</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| this good work.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">| Manifestly, the United States postal service is break- | 1 ing down, and Jehovah’s witnesses must act independ- 1 1 ently where the public interest is involved.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font7">It would seem to this court that men and women engaged in the lofty and idealistic work, as the prosecutors [meaning Jehovah's witnesses who were “prosecuting&quot; the appeal] claim to have been engaged herein, i.e., of spreading their religious conceptions to the public at large, ought to be among the very first to submit to and comply with all reasonable regulations which, obviously, were enacted in the interest of the public health and safety and which regulations were designed for the good of the greatest number. </span><span class="font11">of God’s kingdom during April, the statement following will greatly interest Judge Rutherford, who, during the World War, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, stood for Almighty God and suffered imprisonment because of it. It will also be of great interest to all of Jehovah’s people in New Jersey and elsewhere, and to thousands of other truth-loving and liberty-loving Americans who in this will see more of the thin beginnings in America of an attempt to deprive men and women of their inestimable right to worship and serve Jehovah God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of their own consciences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">On August 7, 1934, they were convicted as “lawbreakers” and sentenced to pay fines or go to prison. Their case was appealed, and first one justice, Charles Parker, of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, affirmed the decision of the Maplewood police judge. Again appeal was taken to a panel of three other justices of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, known as Part 2 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">515</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">There is no question here of prohibition ; it is rather a simple question of reasonable police regulations; regulations which have for their purpose safeguards against those who are not so concerned with ideals and morals; a type, of which there are altogether too many, which resort to any guise, innocent or otherwise, in order to further their illegal schemes and objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prosecutors [meaning Jehovah’s witnesses], notwithstanding the sanctity of their work, are not immune to the necessary and reasonable police regulation herein challenged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The following statement was signed, and the original of it served about noon of Monday, April 29, 1935, to Richard H. Thiele in his office at Newark, New Jersey, by Wallace A. Vick; and by special courier copies were delivered simultaneously on Monday April 29 to Supreme Court Justices Parker, Perskie and Heher at Trenton; and to Governor Hoffman and the attorney general of New Jersey. Copies were furnished also to The Associated Press and other news associations, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font11">and other papers in New York and New Jersey; to radio stations and broadcasting systems; to members of the New Jersey legislature and Congress at Washington, to the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to the president of the United States, to numerous counselors and attorneys, to various branch offices of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and to the president of the Society, Joseph F. Rutherford.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Responsibility</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">On Tuesday evening, April 30, in open court at Maplewood, the official to whom the following statement was specifically addressed coolly and bluntly ordered Wallace A. Vick to be locked up in the Essex county prison for thirty days; Anna Rettenmaier for ten days, and Anna Dziatkiewicz for forty days. Forthwith their bodies were taken in charge by the “strong-arm squad”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah, the Most High God, and His King Christ Jesus unquestionably saw and heard what occurred in that courtroom, and will require the willful transgressors against Him and His servants to pay the penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Eighty days behind the bars will soon be gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But how about those responsible for acting deliberately to hinder the increase and the prosperity of the work of Jehovah’s government, just before the battle at Armageddon ?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Statement</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">To Richard H. Thiele</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">as Recorder of the Township of Maplewood (N. J.) By three of JEHOVAH’S witnesses, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wallace A. Vick,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Anna Rettenmaier, Anna Dziatkiewicz,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greetings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JEHOVAH, the living and true God, gives now to His King Christ Jesus and to His witnesses upon earth the privilege and the responsibility of publishing among the people of all nations the good news of His supremacy, of the majesty of His King and Kingdom, and of the day of His vengeance against all enemies of His government which in the near future shall break in pieces and utterly consume all other kingdoms and dominions and which alone shall stand forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Within this month the New Jersey Supreme Court, by its learned justices, Perskie and Heher, having formally affirmed the judgment of their associate, Parker, of the same Court, who previously did affirm a judgment which you did enter on the seventh day of August 1934 against each of us,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because we, when arrested last summer in Maplewood, were going from house to house in your community for the purpose only of enlightening the people on the Word of God, and each of us was then and thus sincerely and conscientiously serving the Most High God, JEHOVAH, under the leadership of His reigning King and in obedience to His command as written in the Bible, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because to you we gave offense only in this, that we admittedly and intentionally did omit to apply to and receive from the Maplewood police a permit before performing our God-given duty among the people of your community,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now, therefore, you are hereby respectfully invited to notice that, according to the understanding of the purposes of the Most High God as by Him and His King given to His witnesses through His written Word, and in the sober and humble judgment of each of us,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. The written commandments of Almighty God “whose name alone is JEHOVAH” are to us, His witnesses, mandatory and superior to all statutes and ordinances of human origin; and that the statutes and commandments of the “Higher Powers” (Romans 13:1), namely, JEHOVAH and His reigning King Christ Jesus, direct the manner and time or season that His witnesses upon earth to whom He gives understanding of His purposes shall freely and joyfully publish such information among the people of all nations.—Matthew 24:14; Isaiah 12:4-6; 43:10-12; 61:1-3; 62:6, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font9"> The crowning glory of so-called American freedom, from the beginning of the United States of America, including the State of New Jersey, up to this time, has been the unquestioned and untrammeled right of each person to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience without let or hindrance from any person or any source whatsoever; and the Supreme Court of the United States has held “that this [United States of America] is a Christian nation”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. The New Jersey Constitution specifically restrains, estops, and prohibits any legislative, judicial, executive or administrative servant of the people of the State from attempting to regulate or prohibit any person, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses “worshiping Almighty God”, going from house to house for the purpose of informing and enlightening the people On the Word of God and its message concerning His government, whether such information for householders be conveyed to them orally or by means of written or printed communications, inasmuch as the New Jersey Constitution provides that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">“No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshiping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience ’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">4. The deliberate judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court justices by them officially communicated to us, and of you as Recorder of the Township of Maplewood, that we before performing our God-given duty formally submit ourselves for “necessary and reasonable police regulation”, we must and do hereby publicly and freely condemn and reject as contradictory of the superior written judgment and law of the Most High God; and to those justices, officially and personally, and thus also to you, we, in language (Acts 4:19) of our brethren and fellow soldiers of Jesus Christ, freely submit : “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wherefore you are further invited to notice that, according to information communicated on your behalf to us, we shall personally present ourselves before you on Tuesday, the thirtieth day of April 1935, at seven o ’clock in the evening, that you may, if you will, assure us of your readiness to do everything in your power to advance and cause to prosper in the Township of Maplewood and elsewhere the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seriously, in all sobriety, and without malice we now say that if, on the other hand, you decide to choose the unmanly and unreasonable course of attempting to further obstruct this good work and to prosecute a claim upon the bond heretofore provided at our request as security for the cost of our recent appeal in this matter to the New Jersey Supreme Court, then take notice now that such choice by you will be without our concurrence and in deliberate disregard of what either the bondsman or any of us desires or allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Or if you, as the responsible servant of the community, choose instead to impose upon the community the needless burden of expense to maintain each of us in the county prison because we now hereby refuse to pay the several sums of money by you named as fines that you wrongfully imposed upon us, then you must bear the responsibility before the community and, above all, before Almighty God and His rightful Ruler, Christ Jesus, whose respectful and obedient servants we are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font11">HE Copenhagen </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Politiken</span><span class="font11"> has a story smuggled out of Germany showing the stand of a Nazi paper against religious liberty. Under the heading “Dangerous for the State” the Nazi press makes reference to Jehovah’s witnesses as a religious organization which according to its nature is ‘dangerous to the state’. The paper admits that in its eyes the Bible is nothing but unpleasant testimony, and concludes with the thought that “the Evangelical and Catholic churches may yet become as dangerous for the state as Jehovah’s witnesses”. The Devil is merely trying to cover his tracks. The only ones he seeks to destroy are Jehovah’s witnesses. Reports received at Brooklyn are that the only ones of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany who are thoroughly happy are the ones who are in prison as a result of their uncompromising stand. All who tried to compromise are in hot water up to their ears.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Roman hierarchy refrained from the dirtiest of the dirty work. They let the Dominicans and the public officials attend to that. Recently the present pope told the Dominicans to do their stuff again. Meantime some of the public officials are showing where their sympathies are. Ignoring the Constitution, and even common decency, they show the same spirit that lit the fires all over Europe back in the sixteenth century. In Alexandria, Va., Beatrice Kendall, 72 years of age, four other women and four men, were arrested by Sergeant Eberly, and jailed for fifteen days by Judge James Reese Duncan because they visited Alexandria to find out who had rooms to rent, how many rooms, and the rate per person. While seeking this information, which has the approval of the Washington Board of Trade, these witnesses also gave away tracts, which is their method of preaching the gospel. They were not officially arrested on the charge of breathing the Virginia air, though they might as well have been. The official charge was “soliciting without a permit while distributing religious tracts”. What the judge was charged with who sent them to jail for fifteen days may be gathered from a plaque on the courthouse, which reads: “Site of Colonial Jail, 1750-1752. Here Jeremiah Moore was imprisoned for preaching the gospel without a license.” When the nine witnesses were illegally and infamously deprived of their liberties, they were subjected to assault upon their persons in that they were vaccinated contrary to their wishes. It was in Virginia that Patrick Henry gave expression to his famous speech, “Give me liberty or give me death.” If alive today, and living in Alexandria, and having a love of truth, Patrick Henry would be denied the first. Before Judge James Reese Duncan he would be denied both.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font11">HAT it is really necessary to call and call again and again to wake people up to the importance of the great message now going forth throughout the earth is well illustrated by the following letter from A. R. Nutting, 65 Chetwynd Road, West Somerville, Mass.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Woman and War</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">By Rose Henderson, ex-judge of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the Juvenile Court of Montreal</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font11">HE uncivilized woman of the past, when commanded by the state, threw her babes into the Ganges or under the Juggernaut car to appease the “god of wrath”. Today civilized woman in her ignorance hands her son a gun and to the strains of martial music and the waving of flags sends him forth at the command of the state to appease the greed and rapacity of the “god of profits”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Too long have women been fed on the romance and glory of war. Too long have its realities been hidden from them by hypocrisy and lies. The death agonies of the dying have been drowned by the din of martial music. The scars of body and soul have been covered up by gaudy uniforms, gold lace, plumes and medals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The warmongers have fooled and flattered women into the belief that their men folk were fighting for their honor, their home, their God, when in reality they were fighting for oil wells, coal fields, new markets to plunder and new “spheres of influence” to exploit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So far, peace societies have dealt with the problem of making an end of war from the sentimental point of view. They have attempted to tame the beast of militarism with honeyed words, approaching it in a “diplomatic way”, courting the approval of “leading citizens” and being scrupulously careful not to “antagonize” and always loudly proclaiming their loyalty to the “empire”, the “republic”, or whatever form of government prevails in the country in which they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I do not question the sincerity of these people. I have met and talked with many such men and women, and one and all conveyed the impression of sincerity and devotion to the cause of peace. But sincerity and devotion are not enough. A mother may be a devoted slave to her child, yet see it die by inches because she lacks the knowledge of child welfare and fails to understand its needs and constitution. Likewise, a mother, through her ignorance, may feed her children a mental poison which may be the cause of sorrow down to the “third and fourth generation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Economic conditions have forced women to face the question of poverty, unemployment, infant mortality and prostitution, but in comparison to war these pale into insignificance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Resolutely and fearlessly the women of the world must understand the causes of war or see the race exterminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Woman bears the burden of the race in time of peace as w’ell as in war. She does not arm nor does she destroy armies, but she bears and nurtures the armies, both industrial and military, before, during and after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following is a table of the cost of the last war in blood and treasure. These figures are not taken from any pacifist journal nor from the tabulations of a peace organization, but from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Militiaman,</span><span class="font11"> official organ of the Vancouver Military Institute.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">(c) The cost has been estimated on the increase during the period of the war over normal peace expenditures. Reparations paid by the Central Bowers increase their costs and decrease the costs of the Allied Bowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Add to these figures the toll of the world-wide influenza epidemic, which cost 6,000,000 lives, not counting the 8,000,000 in India, and without reckoning those who have died since peace was declared, from cholera, typhus, famine blockades, civil wars and malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The lifeblood, yea, life itself, of women was given to bring forth and nurture these millions, the victims of man’s ruthless folly; given, not in the cause of freedom, but in the cause of mammon.

<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The March of the Dead</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">If the dead of the Great War could be assembled in one great army this is the spectacle they would present:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“At daybreak they start, twenty abreast. Until sundown they march . . . and the next day, and the next, and the next. For ten days the British dead pass in review. For eleven days more the French dead file down ‘the Avenue of the Allies’. For the Russians it would require the daylight of five more weeks. Two months and a half would be required for the Allied dead, to pass a given point. The enemy dead would require more than six weeks. For four months men actually killed in the war, passing steadily twenty abreast—’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The war claimed, says one journal, 10,000 miles of dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If these dead, as they passed by in the melancholy procession, could look into your eyes or could speak to you, what do you imagine their message would be? Would they tell you of the victories and heroics of war, or would they tell you that in war there are no victories for the common people, who supply the cannon fodder and pay the cost—95 percent of all the cost—in life, suffering and taxation for generations after the war is over?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They would tell you that for every “Victoria Cross” on the breast of the living there are 100,000 wooden crosses on the graves of the dead!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the war’s dead could but return for one hour, that hour would be spent in shocking the women of the world into a sense of their responsibility !</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Flower of Manhood Sacrificed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Men assert that during the war women were fiercer in their passions, stooped to meaner and crueler methods of attack, and were more relentless in their desire for revenge against the “enemy” than were the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Scarcely anyone able to retain sanity during the war and watch the effect of its psychology on women will dispute this accusation. In times of peace, at best, women are, with notable exceptions, but the echo, the product of man’s laws, man’s moralty, man’s education, political, industrial and religious institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In time of war, when the world goes mad, when all restrictions are let down, when men mock and laugh at their own moral and ethical codes, then the only appeal is to woman’s primitive emotions, and she is swept into every excess. She becomes the blind, senseless tool of blind, senseless men, who rule the world, men who march in their millions to fight unknown enemies, and to fill unknown graves, because someone told them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If these dead heroes could speak, they would tell of their mangled comrades writhing in trenches, tormented by lice, rats and mice, wallowing like swine in the blood, mud and filth of the battlefields. They would speak of barbedwire entanglements, shell holes, guns, tanks, bombs, grenades, liquid flame, disease germs, poison gas, the babblings of the insane, and the ungodly spectacle of millions of men, armed with every device known to science, doing one another to death over the length and breadth of a continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And yet this picture but lifts the curtain on the first act of the drama of war. It would convey only a glimmer of the suffering that men endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Back of the millions of men are millions of women—mother, wife, sister or sweetheart. Back of these women are millions of children, the mute, outraged, exploited victims of an accursed system making for war.</span></p>

Ministers of the gospel speculate on their heavenly gain in departing souls or acquired virtues in war, but, so far, no one has dared to estimate the cost of war to those helpless victims who bear the greatest burden. The mother heart sinks as she catches a glimpse of the babe she has borne on his way to “embark”. The wife stifles the anguish and terror that clutches at her heart when she hears the words, “I’m called up.” The maiden’s heart sinks when she questions, “Will he ever return?” and sees her dreams of home and children shattered perhaps for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In her heart of hearts every intelligent woman questions if her men folk will be strong enough to withstand the moral degradation of the battlefield, and fears that when they are returned to their homes their moral and physical fitness to be fathers and husbands will be undermined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the women of the middle and ruling classes, generally speaking, war exists for them in conversations, military balls, reviews, anniversary banquets, organizing and raising “patriotic” funds, and kindred activities. Their husbands and sons go to war, but keep well away from the danger zones. They are officers, or subordinates. They fight the war by telephone, from armchairs, and luxurious clubs; the best that can be provided is theirs by “divine right”, and their wives and families are especially favored in many ways. They belong to a different class, many having large investments in munition works, railroads, shipping, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the women of the masses, however, who supply 93 percent of the army, the story is a different one. The women of the masses, during the war, were used to do the meanest work. They were flattered, cajoled, threatened. While the blood of their men folk was being coined into profits on the battlefields, their labor, sex, and necessities were the object of profit extortion and barter at home. In munition, garment and packing factories they toiled incessantly, doing the work of men, but receiving “woman’s pay”. “Ministers of the gospel” grew wrathy and demanded that they “do their duty to replenish the loss of war”; illegitimacy was winked at and excused as “one of the inevitable results of war”. Politicians tricked and deceived them with promises they never intended to carry out. They were told to knit socks, scarfs, sweaters and other garments “to keep the boys warm”, but when they went to buy the yarn they found the price had soared. They were advised by sleek, well-fed men, and diamond-, fur-bedecked ladies, not to forget the “dear boys fighting for our home and honor”, to send them chocolates, cigarettes, and fruitcake; but, alas, when after scrimping a few cents from the pay envelope or “patriotic allowance” they went forth to purchase these things, they found the prices 20 to 100 percent higher than before the war—someone had been “doing their bit” profiteering in a perfectly “patriotic” way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They were told to eat less sugar and bacon; whereupon, after denying themselves and their children they found a corner on both these necessities and huge fortunes being made at their expense; and while men were being shot and jailed for military treason, no one was being hanged, jailed or shot for treason to those men and their dependents who were shedding their lifeblood and wading through hell to “make the world safe for democracy”—or plutocracy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We can approximate the number killed and wounded; we can count the cost of making new garments, procuring food, furnishing implements of destruction; we may calculate the value of cities laid waste, crops ruined, the cost of constructing new homes, ships and railways, but who can measure, who describe, the suffering of the women and children whose homes are laid in ashes, who flee in terror before the advancing army, to hills and valleys, who crouch and shiver in ruins and dugouts, who forage on garbage heaps and feed off putrid flesh and roots, who are raped and famished, but who may not die by the bullet, or the swift thrust of the sword. Speak not to such as these, oh, ye hypocrites, ye befoulers of all that is holy and sacred, of the “glories of war”! What a desecration of virtue! what a mockery of the home! To the women of the masses, war is a grim reality. It sinks its poisonous fangs deep into their quivering flesh and pulsating hearts; it desecrates the marriage vow, breaks up their home, and poisons through venereal diseases the very wellsprings of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A well-known physician, who for the past ten years has given his life to war work and its aftereffects, said to me when discussing this matter, “If I could by some means touch a button and put out of life quickly three-fourths of the babies born since 1914, I would consider I was conferring a benefit on mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Think of the untold agony woman silently endures when she realizes that she and her children are the innocent victims of a foul disease, cursed from the cradle to the grave. And to add to her suffering the terrible thought is focusing itself upon her imagination, that it is her own men folk, husband, son or brother, the dupes and tools of mammon, who are bringing upon her and her babies this unspeakable burden of poverty, disease and woe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The bases upon which war rests are foul— the principles of the thug, the robber, the morals of the jungle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The duty of the soldier is to kill; the more he kills, the greater his “reward”. A “glorious battie” is heralded, &quot;enemy vanquished,” “spectacular heroism,” “territory captured,” and all eagerly watch to see who will be the honored, the recipients of medals, crosses and higher commissions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">War is organized human butchery, and its handmaidens are hypocrisy, robbery, rape, lies, obscenity, profanity, dope. It desecrates virtue and religion, laughs at honesty, and mocks the commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Pulpiteers and War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The church as an organization, to her discredit, be it said, stood solidly by the war. Here and there ministers had the courage to stand by the principles of Christ, but for this they were, in most cases, unfrocked, persecuted and drummed out of the “temple of the Nazar ene”. In every land the church held special services, to petition their national god to give them victory over their enemies, and held thanksgiving services when a victory was announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Surely this is blasphemy indeed; surely its ministers could sink no further! In the words of Mark Twain, when they prayed for victory this is what they prayed for:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“0 Lord, our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle. Be thou near them! With them in spirit—we also go forth from the sweet peace of our firesides to smite the foe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“0 Lord, our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the cries of the wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children, to wander unfriended through wastes of this desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sport of the sunflames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it—for our sakes, who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We ask of One who is the Spirit of Love and who is the everfaithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset, and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Grant our prayer, 0 Lord, and thine shall be the praise and honor and glory now, and ever. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Victory! Victory! Yes, for the steel, coal, and banking kings; for the masses, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the men who fought, and the women who bore them, there is but the grim reality of insecurity, unemployment, and a more brutal form of exploitation to exact the war debt. For the men there is at least the glamor of war, but for the women there is no hero worship, no martial music, no cheering crowds, song, story and laughter; no tablets are erected to them in church, civic building, park or market place. Unlike the women of the other classes, they endured all the horrors of war but none of its lure and abandonment; they enjoyed no dinners, banquets, bouquets, receptions, military displays, and victory balls. For thousands of women of the upper classes war ensured one hectic round of excitement, the glorious abandonment to the satisfaction of the senses, an outlet for their stifled energies, a mask to cover up their half-subdued elemental passions, an excuse to display their power, effrontery and newly acquired ill-gotten gains, a glimpse of which is so ably given in the following verses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THE VICTORY BALL</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">The cymbals crash,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And tire dancers walk, With long silk stockings and arms of chalk, Butterfly skirts,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And white breasts bare, And shadows of dead men</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Watching ’em there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shadows of dead men</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stand by the wall, Watching the fun</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the Victory Ball. They do not reproach, Because they know If they’re forgotten</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It’s better so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What did you think</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We should find,” said a shade,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When the last shot echoed And peace was made?”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“Christ,” laughed the fleshless</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jaws of his friend;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I thought they’d be praying The world to mend.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Pish!” said a statesman Standing there,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I’m glad they can busy Their thoughts elsewhere!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We mustn’t reproach ’em. They’re young you see.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ah!’ said the dead men, “So were we!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Victory! Victory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On with the dance!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Back to the jungle</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new beasts prance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God! how the dead men Grin by the wall, Watching the fun</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the Victory Ball!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">—Alfred Noyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the drumbeats are heard no more; when the bugles cease to call to battle, and the cannons are silent; when the dead are counted, the cost of war estimated, and profiteers have gathered in their bloodstained gold, woman’s sorrow and service begin anew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Back to the homes of the women of the slums, tenements, mills, factories and farms return what is left of poor, disillusioned, sick, halfcrazed humanity. Out from the loins of labor issued these betrayed soldier lads; on the breasts of working-class mothers have they been nurtured and reared. When their masters who bade them go need them no longer, when they have spent their “lives” and conquered their masters’ commercial rival, captured oil wells, wheat lands, and coal fields, back again to the slum shacks, and tenements, to whence they came must they return; there in the drab twilight of obscurity, and poverty, in the homes of their mothers, in the arms of wife, children, sister or sweetheart, will they receive all that is best in life, love, companionship, and unselfish care. There, and there only, in the environment of the home, poor though it may be, may they hope to be brought back once more to sanity, health, and a semblance of civilized life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All over the world, from the sorrowing hearts and ruined homes of mothers, from the lone hearts of children hidden away in orphanages and hospitals for the incurable, arise the cry, the hope, that some day their fathers, their men folk, will cease lulling each other, cease to be the sport of kings and financiers, and resort to ways of reason and peace.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The Betrayal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Women were asked, commanded in the name of democracy, God, and home, to hand over their sons to the state. Almost without question they did so. In return they were promised that war would be abolished, life made more secure, and their children rescued from poverty, ignorance, and slum life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The men responsible for the war of 1914 have not ceased their diplomatic intrigues for one hour. Night and day they sit in every chancellery of the world laying plans for the “next war”, which according to their own statements will be more terrible than the world has yet experienced. These old men, fossilized in hypocrisy, corrupted to the core with their lust for power and greed; these old men not a hair of whose head was injured through war; these old men who waxed fat, achieved “glory”, and “honor” for heroic deeds, mostly performed on paper, at the end of telephones, or wireless, far away from the hell of battle, are gathering up their sinews of war, laying their plans and setting their nets to again ensnare and entrap the youth of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These men are planning wholesale extermination and debasing science for the purpose of war. The nations are groaning under a load of debt, the legacy of the late wars. Standards of health, education, and home life are being reduced to alarmingly low levels in order to obtain millions for the “next war”. Every advance in knowledge and science heralds new discoveries in the art of man-killing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If there is another war it will be terrible beyond thought. The inventions of death during the war were becoming more terrible; month by month since then the ingenious mind of man has gone on perfecting these hellish devices at a rate hitherto undreamed of, . . . Experiments in the use of chemicals as war weapons are being openly conducted by all nations, and by the signatory powers that are party to the Washington Treaty, to prevent the use in war of noxious gases and chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the war had lasted a little longer, on the authority of our air lords, “we should have bombed many more, regardless of sex.” All governments are spending huge sums experimenting in laboratories with a view to making poison gas, lethal acids, high explosives, more deadly, to be dropped on innocent, defenseless women and children from dragons of death, polluting the sky as their murderous bodies glide through the air.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>How Britain Prepares for Peace</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The exchequer’s issues as to war, given in the House of Commons last March (in answer to Mr. T. Johnson, M.P.), showed that between April 1, 1914, and March 31, 1919, there were 9,590 million pounds sterling spent on war. Since that time 1,290 million pounds sterling have been spent on militarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Francis Ahern, Australian correspondent, reports the following interview with a highly placed military officer who was recently in Australia on a secret mission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Behind closed doors of laboratories and in secluded workshops, and in lonely bays or remote spaces of the world, has begun, with government secret funds, the strangest and weirdest battle of wits that has ever been embarked upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Tanks that swim, great metal sea destroyers that fly, uncanny air machines which dive silently beneath the waters to hide themselves, crews who must learn to live and fight in three different elements—land, sea, or air—it is with such marvels and closely guarded schemes that the great push has begun for world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Great Britain is carrying out tests secretly. A machine is being built for the air ministry by the Fairey Co., in which there are four of the new Condor engines, built by the Rolls-Royce Co., cleaving the surface of the water prior to taking wing, and developing nearly 3,000 horsepower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To keep abreast of the times, the British naval authorities have entrusted to a well-known supermarine company the construction of the largest flying boat ordered by them sinee the war. This winged ves-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">sel is intended to go out with the fleet for almost any length of time desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Its hull when resting on the water will ride out rough seas. It will taxi along the water like a surface ship, or speed off through the air. It is to have anchors, foghorns, riding lights, and all the equipment of the ordinary vessel of the sea, while its crew within the hull will eat and sleep on board just like the crew of an ordinary naval craft. Designs also in hand for machines which will be an amplification of such amphibians as the ‘Vieker’s Viking’,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The new machine will fight like a tank on earth, be a superdestroyer on water, and climb to give combat in the air, and when concealment is required, it will fold its wings, seal its hull, and dive like a submarine beneath the surface of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“These uncanny monsters are to be called Tes-saurins, meaning ‘machines which live in all elements’. Science is striving to make these crafts both silent and invincible. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the next war “the whole of the manhood, most of the womanhood, and part of the childhood of the nation will be involved.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Army and Navy Gazette,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The British air ministry has given orders for the construction of a three-engined battleplane which will be the most pow<sup>T</sup>erful and destructive weapon in the world. It will be run with three 1,000-horsepower Napier “Cub” engines, and it is expected to attain a speed of 140 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">General Swinton says that progress is being made in the development of rays for lethal purposes. “We have X rays,” he says. “We have light rays. We have heat rays. ... We may not be so very far from the development of some kind of lethal ray which will shrivel up or paralyze or poison human [creatures].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">General Swinton also prophesies the coming of germ warfare. “I think it will come to that,” he says, “and so far as I can see there is no reason why it should not. ... We must envisage these new forms of warfare, and as far as possible expend energy, time, and money in encouraging our inventors and scientists to study the waging of war on a wholesale scale instead of . . . thinking so much about methods which will kill a few individuals only at a time.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Headlines in the London Daily News</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">A Happy New Year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">GAS MASKS FOR ALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Says Commander Burney:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Gases now exist that are more than 1,000 times as powerful as anything used in the late war, and I venture to think that on a still day containers carrying gas instead of explosives would kill more people than the same weight of bombs. There is one gas so powerful that the person inhaling it would be killed instantaneously. When the gas was tried upon a cat, the animal fell over dead without even a tremor. Such a gas would not give people time to put on gas masks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“With regard to germs and bacteria, I do not propose to enlarge on this matter, but I am given to understand that flasks and containers filled with those could be popped into reservoirs and would thus poison the water supply of all towns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A Happy New Year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The ramifications of war are international. War lords and munition makers know no nation. Their “patriotism” is a cloak for profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Bedford, England, they have a gun—“a trophy”—and in front, on a brass plate, is engraved: “Captured by the Bedfords at Gaza from the Turks.” And on the back, on a bigger brass plate, we read: “Made by Sir George Armstrong, Witworth &amp;&nbsp;Co.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Japan, we are informed, is turning out aeroplanes at the rate of 500 weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font11"> of some time ago has a picture in it. The crown prince of Japan is seen walking with £he chief of the British air mission in Japan. Underneath we read: “Since the disarmament conference Japan has been constructing huge fighting planes under the direction of British aerial experts.” Why are British aerial experts helping Japan to construct “huge fighting planes”? And against whom does Japan propose to use those planes? Apparently Vickers are building some of them, for the Japan </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font11"> reports the accidental destruction by fire of “a new airship at Oppama”, costing 170,000 yen and built by that firm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Successful tests have already been carried out by the United States air service with automatically controlled pilotless aeroplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In these tests the automatic “pilot” was described as using a gyroscope for its brains, and pneumatic apparatus, similar to that in an automatic piano, for its muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By the use of such apparatus, flights of over 90 miles were carried out. Hertzian waves were not used in those tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The American government has built a triplane for war purposes capable of carrying 10,800 pounds of bombs. This flying machine is the largest yet constructed in America; it will weigh 20 tons, and it will be driven by six Liberty (!) engines, developing 2,400 horsepower. Two pilots and two engineers will be carried.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Poison Liquid</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">New York, Oct. 28.—A third victim of “looney gas” poisoning in the research laboratory of the Elizabeth (N. J.) plant of the Standard Oil Company died today. He was Wm. McSweeny, aged 27. Before his death he became so violent he had to be placed in a strait jacket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The United States chemical warfare service has announced the discovery of a new poison liquid so deadly that three drops on the skin will kill a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Captain Bradner, the chief of the department, says that one aeroplane carrying two tons of the liquid could kill every man within a space of 7 miles long and 100 feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The war budget of the United States and all other countries shows tremendous increases over prewar figures. (Disarmament conferences and naval conferences all turned out to be mere shams. The military and naval officials made it their business to destroy them, directly or by inspired propagandists like Shearer at Geneva.)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Mad-House Gas</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">At a meeting of aerial and chemical experts, recently held in New York city, it was stated by Will E. Irwin that one great power has already perfected a “mad-house gas” that can be sprayed upon civilian populations and drive them permanently insane. There are four kinds of gas that can be used, irritating, asphyxiating, incendiary, and mad-house gas, stated Air. Irwin, and governments were diligently manufacturing them in preparation for the next war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The report further states that Air. Irwin’s paper on the future of aerial and chemical warfare, and the discussion brought forth, opened up one of the worst vistas of horrors since Dante wrote his </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>How France Prepares for Peace</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The expenditures in Europe on armaments is colossal, and can have but one object, war. If another war is precipitated, Europe will rapidly rattle back to barbarism. Alany travelers in the small states return shocked at the dehumanized condition of large masses of people who are sinking into a state of hopeless despair, under the load of debt and war expenditure. Another point not fully realized is the fact that the power of France rests upon a black basis. It is astonishing that the peoples of other nations are not awakened to one of the most menacing and sinister facts of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the twentieth century come the questions: Is Europe to be dominated by Africa: are the blacks to be trained to subdue and enslave the white peoples'? And if Europe, why not England? If England, why not Canada?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Supposing friction were to arise between England and America (not at all impossible), how would Canadian mothers feel to see the Negroes of the south sent into the industrial centers to protect the interests of the United States? This would be merely war tactics, exactly what is happening now in Europe. France has under her sway 43,500,000 in Asia, 43,500,000 in Africa, and has now applied to all these people her laws of military conscription. She reckons to have within the next five years a permanent army of 800,000 Africans for war in Europe, if need be, permanently stationed in Europe. The conscription of Africa by France is one of those tremendous events which alter the destinies of nations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Aeroplanes, Without Pilots, Directed from Earth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Hertzian waves for the automatic control of aeroplanes are among the latest peacetime preparations for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">According to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Petit Parisien,</span><span class="font11"> quoted by Reuter, an experiment of flying by this means has been successfully carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A heavy biplane, fitted with an engine of 300 horsepower, says the message, was flown for some time without pilot or passenger, above Etamps, Seine et Oise, without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The machine took off in a fog; the “pilot”, comfortably seated in an engineer’s office, performed some perfect flying movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Post</span><span class="font11"> of about that time quoted a “French expert”, who said that toxic gas, which attacks the nervous system, and lachrymatory gas, “which provokes only temporary blindness,” have not been altogether successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This humane gentleman declared: “Aeroplanes dropping mustard-gas bombs on a town will, in addition to causing the death of many of its inhabitants, render the place absolutely uninhabitable for a number of days. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The effect of this gas, causing, as it does, dreadful pains and, in many cases, permanent blindness, is particularly impressive for the onlooker.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>More Danger</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Having said this much, the expert concluded that the various nations should, therefore, particularly direct scientific research to the betterment of mustard gas. Gas experts, he said, would endeavor to render it more persistent and dangerous!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He added that other gases are under consideration. Among them are certain substances intended to cause temporary loss of control and clear thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By using them, he said, “we could thus witness a whole city staggering to and fro, its inhabitants being deprived of all moral and physical control, and as unconscious as drunkards or idiots.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">France declared to her creditors, after the war, her inability to pay either interest or principal of her war debt, yet, notwithstanding her bankruptcy, France has since 1918 built up one of the most powerful armies and air forces in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Moreover, she has used French credit for the purpose of making military subsidies to Poland, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary and Finland, supplying these countries with munitions and war supplies, thus making Europe today a huge arsenal which needs but a match to cause another international explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is significant that France has now returned to her status of a first-class naval power. She proposes to have 178,000 tons of battleships, 360,000 tons of submarines, as well as auxiliaries. The coast defenses of France have been rebuilt and strengthened since the war, and some of the longest-range guns are now mounted on these shore batteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The war chemistry of today,” said a French scientist a few days ago, “bears the same relation to the war chemistry of 1914 as the machine gun does to the old flintlock. If I were in the shoes of the French minister of war, I should tremble.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among these is a terrible development of yperite, or mustard gas, which, in the form of a fine rain of infinitely pulverized corrosive liquid, may be dropped in bombs from aeroplanes or fired in shells from guns, and which is guaranteed to destroy every living thing within an area of several square miles. Another preparation is a cloud of poisonous arsenical dust that will choke and destroy the lungs. Other gas weapons still, in which experiments are constantly being carried out, contain the bacilli of mortal disease, which may destroy whole populations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Causes of War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">To speak of the economic causes of war has been considered seditious, and disloyal. Men and women are today lying in jail for no greater crime than that they tried to enlighten their fellow men of the causes of war, and the foul deception that was played upon them. If the menace of modern war is to be removed, causes of war must be made known. Who more competent to explain these causes than the war lords themselves? Premier Nitti, in his book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Decadence of Europe,</span><span class="font11"> shows not only the lies and intrigues, before and during the war, but also the sinister motives, the callous hypocrisy of the old warmongers, who gathered at Versailles in the name of the people to make peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Instead of the warmongers’ making peace, as they promised to do, when they induced Germany to lay down arms on the strength of Wilson’s fourteen points, they began to squabble and fight like thieves amongst themselves over the loot of Europe and the plunder of Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war 340,000 persons in England increased their wealth £4,180,000,000. Idleness, legally entrenched behind the system of profits, draws a far larger reward than those who shed their blood and labored for victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When will people realize that it is not the business of war lords and capitalists to make peace ? This war was never intended to end war; for, in the words of a well-known general, “war is a great and profitable industry.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Profiteers and War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">If profits were taken out of war, and the profiteers, patriots, editors, ministers, and politicians put in the first-line trenches, war would not long continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A book has been recently translated, written by M. Caillaux, former prime minister of France, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Whither France Whither Europe,</span><span class="font11"> in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The masters of the cartels and trusts saw quite plainly that the markets were choked up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Stocks were accumulating for which there was no sale, and which they thought a war would help them to dispose of. “War,” they said, “will save us from all this humanitarian nonsense, and deliver us from Socialists and their plans. It will do away with the foolish idea of a European union which would eat up our profits. It, and it alone, will secure us large advances in prices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">M. Caillaux gives some illustrations of the “orgy of profits” made during the war. “The largest smelting works in France saw its profits increase from 5 millions in 1913 to 17 millions in 1916 and 18 millions in 1917.” The profits of a shipping company in 1914 were 6 millions; “in 1916, 18 millions; in 1917, 23 millions; in 19.18,45 millions.” He instances a firm in Japan which in 1915 and 1916 paid dividends of 220 percent, and 600 percent, and adds: “One could quote such eases </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum.</span><span class="font11"> Who does not know this as the war of pillage? We have given a few figures merely to symbolize it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The ethical effect of the war on the capitalists has been negligible, and they continue their policy of public plunder. They have control of the press, which they use for their own purposes, and news is manufactured for them to deceive the people. Indeed, throughout prewar activities we have described, capitalism has increased its power by the war. ... It is stamped with habits of greed, improvidence and harshness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Greed drives the men of this caste in headlong pursuit of immediate profits; profits must be made at any cost, even if it means the sacking of the old world. They are willing to cut down the tree to get its fruit. Improvidence and harshness unite in causing the leaders of the hour to ignore the labor problem. They imagine that by using force—brutality, if need be—they can subdue the wage earners, whose claims they hold in contempt. They will not admit that some day, very soon, perhaps, the wage system will give place to co-operation. . . . They lay upon the poorer classes, by means of indirect levies, the heaviest part of the tax burden. They then take away with one hand what they have given with the other. Indirect taxation cuts down salaries and wages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“They employ both violence and brutality, but they prefer corruption and calumny, which latter they make full use of in the domestic press (which has made it possible) to stir up hatred which they hope to turn into gold. . . . By means of a press which, at the word of command, flatters or condemns, which speaks or remains silent—by means of this press which manufactures news—they control public opinion for their own ends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Herr Rathenau said: “The whole world lives under the dominion of plutocracy. In certain countries it has possessed itself of complete power, makes the law and constitution, and decides on war or peace. . . . Plutocracy is the domination of a caste, an oligarchy, since it has no ideals—but from self-interest; it aims only to maintain itself in power and to enrich itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I went into the British army believing that if you want peace you must prepare for war. I believe now that if you prepare for war—you get war.”—Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What caused the Boer war? Not the queen of England, but the merchants of the city.”— Marshal Foch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“In the long series of English wars with China, opium was from first to last the cause of the quarrel.”—General William F. Butler in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life of General Gordon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What do we all seek? New outlook for an ever increasing commerce, and for industries which, producing far more than they can consume or sell, are constantly hampered by an increasing competition. And then ? Why, new areas are cleared for trade by cannon shot; even the Bourse (the Stock Exchange) for reasons of interest can cause armies to enter into campaigns.”—Marshal Foch, in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">United Service Magazine,</span><span class="font11"> December, 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Wars are precipitated by motives which the statesmen responsible for them dare not publicly avow. A public discussion would drag these motives in their nudity into the open, where they would die of exposure to the withering contempt of humanity.”—Mr. Lloyd George.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">War is a business, and the making of patriots and soldiers is as much the business of capitalist nations as the making of cotton, steel rails, or shoes. Patriots and soldiers are not born; they are molded and shaped out of the potter's clay of childhood. The child is caught in the machinery of war as soon as it is born. The purveyors of war poison assail it on all sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As soon as the child opens his eyes he sees on the wall of his home a picture that differs from all the rest. As soon as he can lisp he inquires, “Who is that in the funny dress in the picture ?” and some one informs him with no uncertain pride that it is grandfather’s picture, who died in the Crimean war; or it’s dad, or uncle Joe, or brother Bill, who died in the “Boer” or the “Great War”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When birthdays and Christmas come around, “auntie” and “granny”, and other members of the family, vie with each other in presenting the “wee laddie” with tin soldiers, drums, guns, cannons, helmets, and every conceivable trapping of war. When a little older, dad or big brother takes him to the park or square, and proudly shows him the gun or armored car captured by “Us” from the enemy, or the memorial with all the names of the gallant heroes who fell fighting for “God, King and Country”. Then the child goes to school at an age when its critical faculties are not yet awakened, and is told of the villainies committed by other nations against “His Country”, and the “glorious deeds of heroism”, and the desire of justice, which alone animates “His Country”. He takes part in Empire days, victory and military displays, and is fed on patriotic music, and a history always biased in favor of “Our Nation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The home makes the patriot in the bud; the schools, churches, and state put on the finishing touches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In order that the poison may sink deep into the child's soul, it only remains to rig him out in the trappings of war, get him enrolled in boy scouts and church cadets, take him to military reviews, and get him marching to martial music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this way the innocent child is laid hold of, first by his parents, then the school, and finally by the church and state, and molded in his pliable years into a first-class patriot and soldier, ready to do his master's bidding.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>The Boy Scout Movement</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Many are ignorant of the real character and object of the Boy Scout movement. They still believe that the people who fight to reduce the standard of living and education, against child labor laws, and the betterment generally of the masses whence these children come, are sincerely interested in the building of their bodies and the training of their minds. These “benefactors” are interested only in so far as these children are molded to be a buttress for a system which maintains them in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In support of the contention that the Boy Scout movement is a military organization, I shall quote as evidence only the official book written by Sir Robert Baden-Powell, entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Scouting for Boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sir Baden-Powell himself, in season and out, everywhere he goes, has refuted the accusation that the “boys” are not being trained for military purposes. In a speech delivered in the city of Winnipeg, I find in the news report of one of his speeches the following: “The scout movement is not a movement in militarism, and I would like you all to step on that argument whenever it is heard; nor is it an amusement for boys. It is a movement to shape the 'characters’ of boys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Toward what end their “characters” are being formed, how sincere and disinterested are the class motives impelling Sir Robert Baden-Powell to take upon himself this noble task of “character-building” of the boys of the workingclass, not only nationally but internationally, can best be judged from the accompanying quotations [see also page 531]:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>“The Old Story”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">And so the dance of death proceeds, and there seems to be no moral force in the world as yet strong enough to check the lust for power and profit of those antihuman beasts of prey now planning the “Next War”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Capitalists continue to grow rich out of war investments, while the poor grow more wretched. In Great Britain the annual interest to the War-Loan lenders is in the region of £350,000,000; the total expenditure on war pensions from August 1, 1914, to March 31, 1923, (partly estimated) is £470,000. Stocks and bonds command a higher value than life. There is an end to the pensioner and his dependents, but to the war loan there is no end; it will go on as long as the people are willing to pay.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>After the War—This</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Today, scarcely seventeen years after the war, heroes have become beggars, and shamefaced squat in the city streets, miserable mendicants, asking for crusts. Women—weary, ravished women, wives and widow’s, old mothers, and next of kin; wan, wasted, muted victims, seek work, but, unable to find it, are driven by the millions to that most loathsome of all occupations, prostitution. Hunger drives them to the streets; disease and desolation, to early graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Like stray mangey cats and dogs, children of the masses creep cautiously from garbage heap to garbage can, and feed on the bits of food, not yet quite putrid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are not all mothers one people? Do not all mothers love their children? Would not all mothers die to save their children from slaughter and suffering? They must be prepared to suffer as much in the cause of peace as they were willing to suffer in the cause of war.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font11">HO may pray to God with the expectation that his prayer will be heard and answered ? The Scriptures answer, at 1 Peter 3:12: “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” There is only one way for a person to become righteous, and that way is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior and then to devote yourself to God and Christ Jesus. It is written, at Romans 4:5, that a man’s ‘faith is counted unto him for righteousness’. It is not possible for a man to be righteous in the sight of God unless he believes that Jesus Christ is his Redeemer and that Jehovah God is the Supreme One from whom all blessings come, and that the Word of God is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Does a person need to go to a church and there have the aid of the clergyman in order to pray? No. The present-day church organizations do not teach that Christ Jesus and His kingdom are the hope for humankind. The clergymen and the churches constitute a part of this evil world and use their organizations for political purposes and to further their selfish interests. Because a man holds the position of a clergyman is no reason whatsoever that God hears his prayers. God is no respecter of persons, and He does not count a man righteous because he is a clergyman. A man who participates in the unrighteous politics of the present day, and who opposes the message of God’s kingdom, is the enemy of God, and his prayers are not heard by Jehovah God. (James 4:3,4) There are many conscientious persons who are Catholics, and who have been wrongfully taught that the priest can pray successfully for other men merely because he is a priest. A good Catholic at Paris heard a speech by radio explaining the Scriptures as to who may pray. He had been erroneously taught that he must go to a priest and have him pray, but, learning the truth, he is now rejoicing in the knowledge that only those who devote themselves to God may pray and that we may pray individually through Christ Jesus without the aid of any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You ask, What must I do to be sure that my prayer is heard by the Lord? You must believe</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">on the Lord Jesus Christ and God, devote yourself to God and His kingdom, and learn the will of God by studying the Scriptures. If you take this course, then you will learn to pray that the w<sup>y</sup>ill of God may be done concerning you. Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to you books that show you where you may find in the Bible the statement of what is the will of God concerning you, and these books you need to help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If a man is a sinner and desires to pray to God, is it necessary for him to have a Catholic priest or preacher pray in his behalf ? No. Jesus said concerning the prayer of a clergyman and of a sinner (Luke 18): ‘Two men went up to the temple to pray; one w<sup>y</sup>as a Pharisee clergyman, and the other a publican, a sinner. The clergyman called attention to his own virtues and thanked God that he was not like other men. The sinner, standing afar off, said: “God be merciful to me a sinner”’; and Jesus declared that the sinner was more pleasing to God than the clergyman was, and that the sinner’s prayer was heard, while the clergyman’s was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the churches today the clergymen pray in order to be heard of men. Concerning this the scripture at Isaiah 29 says that ‘with their mouths they draw near, but their hearts are far removed from God’. At 2 Timothy 3 it is written that those men ‘have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof; from such turn away’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every person who devotes himself to God and Christ Jesus and then faithfully obeys the Lord’s commandments may enjoy the privilege of prayer with the expectation of having his prayer heard and answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Most of the clergymen deny that the blood of Christ Jesus is the redemptive price of man. They also deny the inspiration of the Bible. God will not hear their prayers, for the reason they are not righteous within the meaning of the Scriptures. It is written, in Hebrews 11, that without faith it is impossible to please God, and only those who please Him may pray to Him. When there is great distress in the land, such as a famine, the clergy join with politicians to pray for prosperity. Their prayers are not</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">heard by Jehovah, for the reason that they do not ask according to the Word of God and are not in harmony with God. They claim that famines come upon the people as a punishment from God, whereas the Scriptures declare that the Devil is responsible for such. God sends His rain upon the just and the unjust alike, but He hears and answers the prayers only of those who believe Him, and His Word, and believe on Christ Jesus as the Savior of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[The foregoing is another in the series of thirty-six talks by Judge Rutherford, obtainable in the form of phonograph records, and carried in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font9">as a special feature by arrangement with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brooklyn, N. Y. These talks deal with vital Bible truths and related matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The direct and straightforward presentation of important issues will prove of real help to everyone who will give them thoughtful and sincere consideration. Inquiries concerning the records should be addressed to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and not to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.]</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Another Good Witness at Plainfield, N.J.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">TEHOVAH, the Most High God, said that He and His King Christ Jesus would take pleasure in His witnesses upon earth who would faithfully keep His commandments at the end of the world, where we now are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On April 18, in obedience to the command of the Almighty God, more than a hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses of the New Jersey division went to the city of Plainfield. There, during practically the entire day, they joyfully went from house to house, telling the people of good will about Jehovah’s supremacy, the majesty of His King and kingdom, and of His vengeance against all enemies of His kingdom. To those who desired the message in printed form, booklets were provided, and also printed notices of special radio programs concerning the kingdom of Jehovah. Thousands of such printed notices were left with the people at their homes; also many hundreds of the new booklets that Jehovah’s witnesses were serving to people of good will throughout the world that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As usual, a committee of three representing the entire company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Plainfield called in the morning upon the chief of police. The committee spokesman read aloud to the chief a letter giving notice of the presence of Jehovah’s witnesses in the city, and expressing the hope that the police department would find it convenient during the day to have a large share in advancing the good work of Jehovah’s kingdom. With the letter was filed a list of the names and addresses of all the company of publishers, including nearly every one of those who in recent weeks had been arrested by the Plainfield police and locked up in the city prison or the county prison after being given a so-called “fair” trial before the police judge who loudly threatened them that if they ever came back to Plainfield he would give them the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is herewith presented the complete text of the letter that was read to the Plainfield chief of police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To the Police Department, Attention Chief of Police, Plainfield, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May it please you again to notice that in obedience to the command of the Most High God, JEHOVAH, and under the leadership of His King Christ Jesus, we whose names appear on the appended list have happily come again to Plainfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Jehovah’s witnesses we are here today to publish the good news of Jehovah’s supremacy, of the majesty of His kingdom and of the day of His vengeance against all enemies of His kingdom. This we do, as you know, by going from house to house and exhibiting to people of good will that thrilling message in printed form, including notices of radio programs concerning the kingdom of Jehovah God, which notices thousands of residents of Plainfield have asked us to deliver to them from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Knowing that you appreciate your duty of protecting from assault every one who is peacefully performing lawful work in the city, we hereby renew our request that the police power of this community see to it that we are free to carry on our life work of thus preaching the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom without interference from any opposers or anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That you will find it convenient to enjoy a very large share in advancing this work today, in the public interest, is our confident hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Respectfully submitted this eighteenth day of April 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The chief listened to the reading of the entire letter. At the end of the reading he showed the most intense rage, and furiously shouted: “You don’t need a permit from the chief of police to broadcast; now go and broadcast that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The committee calmly thanked him and departed, going to joip their brethren in the house-to-house witnessing. The work went forward. The power of Jehovah and His mighty invisible organization protected His witnesses. Not a worker was even approached by a police officer all day; and at the evening assembly of the field workers there was great joy and many expressions of thanksgiving to Jehovah for the happy privileges shared by all during the day. Many reminded one another of the eventful day when God’s people came out of Egypt following the slaughter of the firstborn of all the Egyptians, when Jehovah delivered Israel from their oppressors. On that day, according to the Scripture, not a dog even moved its tongue as<sup>-</sup> God’s people departed from Egypt to serve Him in obedience to His command.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Quotations from Boy Scout Literature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">(See page 528)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Be Prepared” is the motto of the boy scout. This is no mere catch phrase, for what and against whom is very definitely stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We have many powerful enemies round us in Europe who want very much to get hold of trade in our great manufacturing towns and our vast farmlands in our overseas dominions. Their way, and they know it, is to stab suddenly at the heart of the Empire, that is, to attack Britain. For this reason every Briton who has any grit in him will be prepared in defending his country.” (Page 280)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“If a strong enemy wants our rich commerce and dominions and sees us in Britain divided against each other he would pounce in and capture them.” (Page 278)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Roman empire at last fell chiefly because the voung Romans gave up soldiering and manliness.” ‘(Page 276)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We ought really not to think too much of any boy, even though a cricketer and a footballer, unless he can also shoot and drill and scout—that is the fellow who is going to be useful if we are attacked. I hope also that before long every eleven, whether football or cricket, will also make itself a good eleven for shooting and scouting; and, therefore, useful for our king and country when needed. So make yourselves good rifle shots in order to protect the women and children of your country if it should be necessary.” (Page 281)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The curious result of our training is, we are being continually asked by officers in the service to send them recruits who have been trained as boy scouts. They prefer them to any other for soldiering duties.” (Page 319)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“War has put the vitality of the movement to the highest test, as it has done the results of our method of training. Both in the army and navy, old scouts have distinguished themselves above the average, and praise of their previous preparation comes to us from admirals and generals alike. The war work done by the boys has won for us splendid letters of recommendation from the prime minister as well as from heads of ministries in government departments.” (Page 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It is something to know that our principle of inculcating character, as a basis of good citizenship, supplies also the best foundation for making a good soldier or sailor. The knights taught themselves the use of arrows in order to protect their religion and their country against enemies. Thousands of men fought against the Mohammedan Turks to maintain the Christian religion; they were always ready to fight and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">kill</span><span class="font9"> in upholding their </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">king</span><span class="font9"> or their </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font9"> or their ‘honor’. We are their descendants, and we ought to keep up their good name and follow their steps. You scouts cannot do better than follow the example of your forefathers, the knights who made the British nation into one of the greatest and best that the world has ever seen.” (Pages 25 and 26)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>“A Few Years Do Not Matter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">“We have all got to die some day; a few years more or less of our own lives don’t make much matter in the history of the world; but it is a very great matter if, by dying a year or two sooner than we should otherwise do from disease, we can help to save the flag of our country from going under. Therefore, think it over, be prepared to die for your country if need be, so that when the moment arrives you may charge home with confidence, not caring whether you are going to be killed or not.” (Page 290)</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend G.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Bayonet Fighting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Lecture by Major Campbell</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(The following is a true copy of a mimeographed document issued to officers and N.C.O.’s by the British government during the World War.)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font11">HAT I am going to talk about is of vital importance to you, officers and N.C.O.’s [non-commissioned officers] in the infantry, and that is bayonet training, which is more than bayonet fighting. It was cultivated by us, and is our own special training and over 100 brains have worked at it, and the tips I am going to give you have all been worked against the Hun. The tips have been sent to us and consolidated; mind you, we are going to win this war, and we, the infantry, are responsible for the whole thing, and we are going to win it with rifle and bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first three points are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">(1) Tgctical means of the bayonet and how it must be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(2) How to train for it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(3) The true meaning of the spirit of the bayonet.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">As long as there is rapid fire and big gun fire, the bayonet must be used. The only way to get protection from rapid fire is to get under the ground as soon as you can; and the only way to get the man out of the ground is by the bayonet. Cold steel is the only means of clearing a trench. First you take the trench, then it has to be cleared, and this can only be done by the bayonet. The present situation of affairs is like two boxers in a clinch; they clinch for safety, and it is impossible for them to hit whilstthey remain in a clinch. The next big decisive battle is going to be one almighty hand-to-hand conflict. Whole battalions, brigades and divisions will go forward, and the side that gets the best of it is going to win this war. About 80 percent of the infantry will go forward armed with the rifle and bayonet. No doubt the crust will be broken with the trench mortar and bomb, but the offensive is going to be pushed home with the rifle and bayonet. Everybody who goes forward must know how to use the rifle and bayonet. He must know how to kill with it, in the same manner as he knows how to play football. They must also practice bayonet control—and it is very difficult to control a man after he has once killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have one overwhelming advantage in this war, and that is individuality, which is our British birthright, the fighting spirit which is in every one of you here. Some little time ago I was asked to interview a lance-corporal of the 37th division who had killed two Boches. He</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">was quite a different person to what I expected him to be. He was a very meek sort of chap, and the last person you would have suspected of doing any killing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This lance-corporal, it appears, was on patrol one night in company with two privates. One of the men remarked that he heard someone approaching and he felt a little nervous; the other private was a little pluckier, and wanted to go and see. The men lay flat on the ground and waited, and suddenly they saw a party of Germans approaching. (I only listened to the lancecorporal’s story; whether the two privates killed any Boches I am unable to say.) The lance-corporal hated the idea of killing with the bayonet, but nevertheless he went in at the nearest Boche and got him in the arm. He withdrew and the Boche made a point at him, which he turned aside. He then made another point, and the lance-corporal this time bayoneted him in the liver. “After I had killed him,” he said, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font11"> seemed to git mad and felt as though I wanted to go on killing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I give you this story just to let you see that the man had the fighting spirit in him, and was able to use it when the chance came his way. Once your men have got this killing spirit they will take to it like drink. I do not say that the German is not a good fighter; to my mind he is the best fighter of his type in this war, but only whilst he is under the control of his officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Once this control is lost, then he is lost; and this is the point where we start. We start where the Boche leaves off. This hand-to-hand fighting is the last word in fighting, and it is where the human element comes in. It is the human element which is going to win this war. Now, you fellows have played football, and know perfectly well that the side that has the fighting spirit is the one that is going to win. There is no better illustration of this fighting spirit than the boxing contest between Wells and Carpentier. Everybody said Wells must win; how could Carpentier win, being 5 inches shorter and 3 stone lighter and only 18 years of age? Wells was the best heavyweight boxer we had. In the first round Carpentier was nearly knocked out, but the fighting spirit in him prevailed and Wells was knocked out in the fourth round. Everybody said Wells must have been “sick” and that they were just playing to artificial skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The second match lasted 73 seconds, and again Wells was beaten. Later on Wells was put up against Bandsman Blake. Wells easily beat Blake, because Blake had not the skill to apply. It is just the same with us; we have got this great advantage over the Boche and we are going to apply this by means of the rifle and bayonet, but it is much harder to kill with the bayonet. There are two kinds of fighting: distant, with artillery and rifle fire, and the other, hand-to-hand fighting with the rifle and bayonet. This second kind of fighting is the one that appeals to the temperament, and the only fighting you can die at when your blood is up, and it is the kind of fighting that is going to decide this war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When you go forward you go forward to kill or be killed, and you are going to do your killing with the bayonet. You must not miss him; if you do, you are “for it”. It is very important to know where to put the bayonet The German is a professional soldier and he has studied soldiering for years just as keenly as we have played football or Rugby. We ourselves have never thought of war seriously. The following is part of a proclamation by the German issued to his troops:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Butchery as a Duty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">“In the name of God! 'Forward!’ It is not our fault that if in this bloody war we carry out the duty of executioner. Cold steel has been put into your hands. You must thrust the bayonet between the ribs of the enemy; you must also shatter the butt end of your rifle on the skull of the enemy. You have only to use your weapon against Russia, France, Belgium and, above all, the British.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are, however, far better places than the ribs to thrust your bayonet, and these are: the face, throat, chest, and thighs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When using the bayonet use it the same as you would use a punch. The “point” of a bayonet is just like a punch—in and out, quickly— no hesitating. Thrust it far enough to kill, and no more. You never pause in a punch in boxing; and the same thing applies to the “point” in bayonet fighting. The following will give you some idea as to what depth a bayonet must be thrust to kill: Man’s thighs, 6 inches; throat or neck, 4 inches; chest, 4 to 5 inches. Now if you get him in the chest, just under the chin, he will crumple up just like paper. A man hit anywhere in the chest will cough; and if he coughs he is done for. The “thighs”—people very often forget the thighs. This is a very good place, the nerves and arteries are there, and the bayonet will go in and out very easily. It is important to know that the bayonet will not even go through our web equipment; that is why we do not encourage men to make a direct point at the stomach. Always go for the throat; it is close to the eyes and will make a man parry too soon. If you bayonet a man in the spine or the shoulder blades you will find it very difficult to withdraw. Everything I am telling you has actually been done at the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A good thing to remember when you make an assault is to go forward with your magazine charged, and if you get your bayonet fastened in the Boche and you cannot pull it out, fire a round in him. If you find that your magazine is empty, don’t stand tugging at your rifle, but pick the Boche’s rifle up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He has got a good rifle and bayonet, and if you cannot get his, then use your fists. If the enemy is running away from you, then the best place to put your bayonet is in his kidneys; this is close up to the spine and just below the belt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It will go in and out quite easily, and a “point” of 4 inches is quite enough. The following is a story of a kidney punch. The Boches had made a small trench, and this trench had to be taken. The enemy were surprised, and when they saw the bayonet they scattered and ran. The party who went forward were in a killing mood arid were under the command of a young officer with only six weeks’ active service. To my mind, I think it was criminal to allow an officer with so little service and experience to take part in the assault. If that officer had been asked to go in for a boxing contest without first having trained, he would have refused, yet he was allowed to go in a bayonet assault. Bayonet fighting is harder than a 20-round contest, and a hundred times harder than Rugby or football. You should apply your knowledge of games to this work. You would never dream of playing football without practicing; then why undertake this work without it. This boy went forward; he had got the right spirit in him, and was ahead in the charge; they cleared the trench and, as I have said, the Boches ran; he followed on the heels of a fat and heavy Boche who was lagging behind. As soon as he got up to him he jammed his bayonet as hard as he could in the hind quarters of the Boche. Of course, it stuck there; but luckily a sergeant coming immediately behind him, and remembering what he had been told, finished him off with a thrust in the kidneys. A boxer, before he enters into a contest, knows that he must have strength, and so he develops it by getting a sack and punching it a thousand times, until he feels confident; and yet it is far harder to fight with the rifle and bayonet. Therefore, it is useless unless you have the strength to apply. At the beginning of the war many regiments were made to charge from 2/&lt;‘.'G0 yards, and when they got to the enemy's trench they were thoroughly exhausted and had not the strength to use the bayonet. In several cases the men used their fists. Another thing, when a trench has been taken too much time has been wasted in clearing it. It has been known for men to start looking for souvenirs immediately they have taken a trench; now, this is disastrous. I want to impress upon you officers and N.C.O.’s that when once a trench has been taken and your men have got their fighting spirit to a pitch, then they are very hard to control. Try to get every one of your men to use the bayonet wherever he goes, in or out of the trench. When the men get into a trench they must kill as quickly as they can. Individual training of the application of the bayonet is very important, and it is up to you officers and N.C.O.’s to realize the limitations of the bayonet and that it can only be used by a man that is fresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The advance must be done under cover, either by fire, smoke, or any other form. We will study the other arms. Look at the artillery; its efficiency is excellent, but this is the second joint. Look how we study rifle fire; that is another joint. But the top joint of all is hand-to-hand fighting, and unless this joint is efficient we cannot win this war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mind you, we are the ones, the officers and N.C.O.’s of the infantry, who control the top joint of fighting, and this joint must be studied by us. Whenever you make a charge, do not make it like this—it has often been done: A certain time to attack has been given, say 8: 00 a.m., and all are ready, but the men have had only one hour’s notice and consequently have had no time to reconnoiter. They rush over the top and run for about 20 yards or so. They get flurried and their early human element comes out completely. Let us say they forge ahead; the thick, fat and prudent lag behind. The line goes on and the fellows in front unconsciously close in and bunch together, incidentally making a very target for the enemy’s machine-gun fire. They are all probably bowled over, and the direct result is that the enemy’s morale is increased and our men in the trench behind have been almost demoralized. Before a boxer enters a ring he likes to look about before he commences the fight; and it is just the same when you are going to make a charge. Get your men out as quietly as you can and keep them steady; don’t jog, don’t trot or double more than 20 yards. A cavalry charge is only 50 yards, and that is on horseback. This training should be dealt with seriously, and you should apply the same spirit to it as you would do to your games. Poets say it is a fine thing to die for one’s country; I say that it is far better to kill for your country. Now the first thing is the “on guard” position. There are three points. Always get an opponent to “go for”; don’t go “on guard” against nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You must have something to point at. The only dangerous point of the bayonet is the tip. The right hand grasping the small of the butt and kept in front of the belly-button.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By keeping your right hand there the rifle is supported and you don’t feel the full weight of it. When you “point”, “point” hard, in the same way as you would punch in boxing. There is no fixed position for the feet, but they should be in such a position as to give you a good balance and to prevent you from falling over. Do not get into a fencing position; be ready to go forward with either foot. All the time work the man’s brain; if you want anything to stay in the brain it must go in through the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are teaching men you want to be able to get their brain working like lightning, and to get them to come “on guard” by the click of a finger. The bayonet has won battles for 200 years or more; and the sooner we realize this, the better it will be for us. It is the infantryman’s third arm. He should look after it and have every confidence in it. My definition of “morale” is “confidence plus enthusiasm”; and unless a man has confidence he cannot have morale.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Guarding</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Your guard is from the throat to the tip of the shoulder; this is the only place to guard. Always look at the thing you want to parry. If your bayonet comes off, then use your butt end; no steel helmet will prevent it. Get your men to understand all these points. Get them to practice in their billets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">orgenthau, Sr., one of President Roosevelt’s close advisers, recently said: “All Europe is ready and on the brink of war.” Lloyd’s shipping firm recently predicted European war chances at 3 to 1, to come inside of 18 months. (Ex-Secretary of War Baker and Frank Simonds, expert war correspondent, both declared war will soon come and our participation is “inevitable”.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Self-preservation for our own country is a first law, not selfish, but logical. As a burnt child dreads the fire, we may well question our own course when governments quibble over economic and political issues while secretly deliberating and planning for war. Accepting war predictions at one-half their assumed value, their importance is certain, more serious, in fact, than any other problem. After a century and a half the greatest world democracy has not advanced one step toward a national peace policy. Until some better plan is offered, a plebiscite on war in advance of congressional action is infinitely better than big battleships and bigger armies that waste enormously both money and men by inviting war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In 1917, though professing fear from foreign invasion of our rights by countries of Europe with whom we were at peace, and though voicing humanitarian ideals, we were finally swept into that World War, although Norway, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, and other countries were undisturbed by century-old enemies battling at their doors. Presumably they did not have heavy foreign investments in jeopardy. Whatever the controlling agency, we blundered into war then, and will blunder again when financially inspired propaganda and war lords unite to arouse war hysteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Colonel Drew, a brave Canadian soldier, describing the methods of the armament and munition makers, said: “At Geneva William B. Shearer admitted he had already received $55,000 as partial payment for his services for having gone to Geneva and, as he himself explained, ‘sown distrust between the representatives’ and, as a result, the conference broke down, or at least that was Shearer’s claim.... President Hoover appointed a Senate committee to inquire into the facts disclosed in Shearer’s action.” “Before that Senate committee Shearer swore that he had been employed by the armament firms to do what he could to make the British delegates distrust the American delegates at Geneva and to make the American delegates distrust the British delegates; he swore that he had been employed to do similar work on other occasions; and he swore also that other men were employed to do the same work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I stated in the House, when the arms embargo proposal was before Congress this year, that money we loaned our Allies (since largely repudiated) and approximately $11,000,000,000 in amount was raised by American taxpayers to pay American manufacturers for furnishing war supplies to European nations. The United States taxpayers thus paid American manufacturers who provided munitions for the Allies in addition to vast expenditures made by our own government in that same war for our armies. That was a prize and price of war. Eleven billion dollars was the prize sought and won by American munition makers. Won by our entrance in the war. Lost to them if we kept out.

International securities were also involved among motives for our war entrance, but we saw a president just elected because he kept us out of war practically demand from Congress a declaration of war because of mistaken facts he read to us, that I have presented to the House on different occasions, with Secretary Lansing’s correction of facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">INTERNATIONAL MURDERERS, Limited, do not care who gets killed, so long as they get the profits. Thus Mr. K. K. V. Casey, of the Du Pont company, testified that in 1925 that company shipped 40 tons of TNT to Mukden, China, in false boxes. When Japan grabbed Manchukuo, Mukden was the first place seized. Probably this TNT was used to put an end to the Open Door policy of the United States Government in that country. British munition makers connived at the rearming of Germany as early as 1926, and could have brought pressure on the government to prevent such rearming, had they so desired; but, being stronger than the government, they went right ahead with their work. When the sad news got around among the arms makers that there would be a so-called “disarmament conference” at Geneva, the Liege Gun Makers Association, which seems to be a sort of clearing house, spread the alarm among all the gun makers of the world, explaining that their reason for doing it was that the time was so short that the governments would not have time to consult them. Full arrangements were made by the gun makers of all countries to make sure that their respective countries would not send anybody to Geneva that would interfere with their business. This gun makers’ congress was held in Paris, and had for its objective just what took place at Geneva, the sabotage of the world’s hopes for peace. It is claimed that in Great Britain at least 3,000,000 people are interested in the arms ring, and that the combined capital of the principal British armament firms exceeds $300,000,000. In the Vickers concern there are no less than 48 shareholders named Vickers; not one of them holds less than 42,000 shares. Does anybody suppose they will give that up without a fight?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>The Handwriting on “Christendom’s” Wall</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">&lt; &lt;&nbsp;TiELSHAZZAR the king made a great feast</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■D to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.” (Daniel 5:1) This feast was held in the king’s palace, and on the very night that Babylon was overthrown by the Medes and Persians. The time of the fulfillment of this prophetic motion picture from real life seems to be shortly preceding the oncoming “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, Armageddon. Hence it must picture a time after Christ Jesus begins His reign (in A.D. 1914) and is sent forth by Jehovah God to oust the enemy and shortly before the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Chaldaic word for “feast” is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">lechem, </span><span class="font11">meaning “common eating together”. “A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry; but money answereth all things.” (Ecclesiastes 10:19) The greed for gain and power brought those feasters together in a great carousal or common drunken revel. Now the “love of money”, “the root of all evil,” brings into a common assembly those of all nations bent on reproaching the name of Jehovah and on doing violence to those who serve Him. At the time of Belshazzar’s feast war was on between the Chaldeans on one side and the Medes and Persians on the other, and doubtless the feast was held by Belshazzar that he and his men might for a time forget what was going on outside their fortification and to afford them opportunity to further devise deeds of wickedness. (Proverbs 4:17) Bread- </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(lechem-)</span><span class="font11"> eating well pictured the present-day eating of the common bread of conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses, His “hidden ones”.—Psalm 83:1-5.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>“Christendom” in Trepidation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Today “Christendom” is in great fear and trepidation because of seeing the oncoming battle of Armageddon. They know something terrible is impending, but they have not the knowledge of God’s Word or faith in it to determine what it is. The earthly seed of Satan, particularly the rulers of “Christendom”, which are the religious, political and commercial elements, are pictured by King Belshazzar, the son (or grandson) of Nebuchadnezzar. Belshazzar’s thousand lords picture more particularly those in the inner circle of “Christendom” who, together with the king or chief officers, control or rule the people. Their hearts are heavy because of what they sense is approaching, exactly as Jesus foretold (Luke 21: 25, 26), and hence Satan sees it is well to 'give wine unto those of heavy hearts’. (Proverbs 31: 6) It is the “wine of violence” directed against God’s people and His cause. Satan having lost out in the great “war in heaven” (Revelation 12:7-10), his cohorts on earth now need “wine” to cheer them, because now is a time of “woe to the inhabiters [rulers] of the earth”. (Revelation 12:12) They are seized with perplexity and distress.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Desecrating the Golden Vessels</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">“Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple [of Jehovah] which was at Jerusalem ; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.” (Daniel 5:2) The golden vessels here mentioned represented those who are now diligent in putting forth their best endeavors to honor the name of Jehovah. Those vessels were for sacred use in the service of Jehovah, and not for any selfish pleasure bringing further reproach upon Jehovah’s name. Belshazzar’s father had been guilty of effrontery when he robbed the temple of these vessels, and now the use of them by this infidel, drunken crowd would add insult and bring further reproach upon Jehovah’s name. At the present time “Christendom” by its elect ones, which are the visible 'seed of the Serpent’, would bring greater reproach upon Jehovah’s name by persecuting and humiliating and improperly treating God’s faithful remnant who bear testimony to His name and His kingdom and who are declaring the day of God’s vengeance against Satan’s organization. Modern Babylon, or ''Christendom”, would desecrate these chosen vessels of the Lord by using them in a ridiculous manner, and thus in their carousal would make a merry time with them. It is noticeable at this time that “Christendom’s” mouthpiece (or publicity agents, to wit, the public press) takes great delight in ridiculing and holding up to scorn Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God, which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.” (5:3) Today it is the strong-arm squad, acting on orders, that bring forth the “golden vessels” of the Lord, that is to say, the faithful remnant who are Jehovah’s witnesses;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and they do not handle them in any soft and delicate way, but rudely, and speak to them with harsh and angry words. Each one of the faithful remnant is a “vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work”. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font11"> Timothy 2:21) Jehovah’s witnesses are brought forth and exposed to the view of and exhibited before the drunken revelers of “Christendom”. The purpose of this part of the conspiracy is to make Jehovah’s witnesses the center of ridicule and reproach by centering attention upon them while the revelers attempt to make them appear ridiculous. Thus those of “Christendom” show themselves as being on the side of God’s vilifiers; and thus they don the garments of Baal (the Devil) and mark themselves for the slaughter that must shortly follow upon them at Armageddon. (2 Kings 10:18-27; Jeremiah 25:33-36) All nations of “Christendom” now hate Jehovah’s witnesses, as Jesus foretold (Matthew 24:9), and all are engaged in a conspiracy and are doing what they can to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name by ill-using His witnesses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Praising the False Gods</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">“They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.” (5:4) It was the wine of Babylon that was being drunk out of the golden vessels from Jehovah’s temple, and this added to the hilarity of the rulers, and they got a great thrill out of it, and this induced them to praise everything except Jehovah and those who are on His side. Now those composing “Christendom’s” organization like to pose as the law-abiding, peacemaking and prosperity-making crowd. To this end they seek and use the law-making and law-enforcement powers to bring the anointed ones of God into disrepute and to subject them to great humiliation. They take this course of action upon the false pretext and claim that Jehovah’s witnesses are a menace to the peace of the existing governments. The truth of God’s Word when told reflects very unfavorably upon the iniquitous doctrines and work of those who rule in “Christendom”, and in their anger and in furtherance of their conspiracy they enact laws to prevent the telling of such Scriptural truths to the people, and they take whatever course they can to cause the truth to be suppressed. They conspire together to destroy freedom of speech, freedom of press, and the free expression of one’s understanding of God’s Word; and all of this they do upon the wrongful claim that such is necessary in order to maintain the peace of the state. Jehovah now has the entire drunken crowd in derision. (Psalm 2:4) It is time for the handwriting concerning the wicked crowd of “Christendom” and their end to appear upon the wall. It does appear!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>The Handwriting on the Wall</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">“In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.” (5:5) The facts of modern history show that fulfillment of this began with the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in London, England, in May, A.D. 1926, at which a testimony was issued To the Rulers of the World. The “fingers of a man’s hand”, which did the writing on Belshazzar’s palace wall, pictured Jehovah’s power exercised, by his “right hand”, Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus uses the faithful remnant of witnesses on earth in connection with His work in serving notice upon the visible part of Satan’s organization, and of this fact the invisible part of that organization also no doubt takes notice. (2 Corinthians 3: 2, 3). Thus God causes Christ Jesus to bring forcibly to the attention of the enemy notice and warning of the enemy’s early downfall. The fingers of the man’s hand “wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall”, hence in the well lighted surface of the wall, thus forcing the revelers to see it. This illustrates how Jehovah does nothing in the dark, but that He acts against the enemy only after full warning, and He causes His witnesses to openly and aboveboard declare His judgments against the enemy. The enemy will never be able to say that they did not hear and that they unintentionally overlooked what Jehovah said to them. They are compelled to take notice of the message of truth whether they want to do it or not. Today the rulers exhibit perplexity and distress, and at the same time they are drinking the wine of Babylon in their efforts to hide their perplexity while they go on feverishly preparing for war. While they are thus doing Jehovah causes the message of truth to be put before them under the light, which message in substance says to them: “Soon you will have a fight, and a losing fight.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>“Freedom for the People&quot;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">In London, England, a warning was sounded openly and aboveboard in May, 1926, which message was heard by the ruling powers of “Christendom”, but at which they scoffed and which they have spurned. The following year (July, 1927) at the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in Toronto, Canada, there was delivered before a visible audience of 15,000, and to an unseen audience of millions by means of the till-then greatest radio hookup, an address entitled “Freedom for the People”, and the resolution “To the Peoples of Christendom.” was read to and adopted by the audience, visible and invisible, and later distributed earthwide. To Belshazzar and his revelers the handwriting, the message on the wall, was notice and warning. “The king saw the part of the hand that wrote,” but did not see the power that moved the hand. Today the rulers have seen Jehovah’s human agents used in serving to give them notice of warning, and they have heard the notice of warning, but they have not seen or discerned Jehovah’s spirit which moves such agents or servants to bring that notice of warning to them. The handwriting on Belshazzar’s wall was by the power of God, and for that reason could not picture the present-day </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">man-made </span><span class="font11">depression or bad economic conditions that affect the world. That handwriting on the wall foretold disaster to Belshazzar the king of Babylon and his army; and in modern times the fulfillment thereof foretells the doom of Satan’s organization, which is Babylon including “Christendom”. The judgment, notice and warning must be delivered before the execution of the judgment, and that is why Jehovah’s witnesses engage in declaring the day of the vengeance of our God.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>“Against Satan . . . for Jehovah”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">“Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.” (5: 6) So too now the rulers have been sobered for a time, but this has served only to harden their hearts. It was in A.D. 1928 that the Lord caused His remnant on earth to make declaration of Jehovah’s judgment which is written against Satan and all of his organization, and to give warning that all who would live must take the side of Jehovah. That year, at Detroit, Michigan, at the seventh of a series of annual international conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses, there was issued and broadcast over the then largest radio network the resolution Declaration against Satan and fob Jehovah, together with the supporting speech, and during the year that followed millions of copies of this, in many languages, were distributed throughout “Christendom”. As to the rulers thereof that message of notice and warning somewhat loosened their joints and caused their knees to knock together. That would sober them for a time. Shortly thereafter, in 1929, the great commercial crash came and “Babylon” began to sober up a little more, and the chief ones thereof showed a dull countenance instead of a bright one. This corresponds to the prophecy uttered by Jesus, in Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast was in a foreign language, and not known to him. Even if he could read it, he was not learned therein, and not able to interpret the same. Likewise today the message is not of human interpretation. The rulers of “Christendom” saw the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses and heard what they were declaring, but the force and significance of their message needed some explanation or interpretation. From the “brain trust” of his day Belshazzar wanted an explanation of what he saw on the wall (5: 7,8), and in modern times the rulers want to know the meaning of the present-day events, including what Jehovah’s witnesses declare, and to find this out they ask their own clergymen and “wise men”. But none of the “wise men” of Babylon can read or interpret the same, because it is all foreign to them. ‘Their Bibles do not read that way.’ They are careful to predict nothing that would be offensive to the political and financial ruling element; hence they say: “Give no heed to these foolish Jehovah’s.witnesses, because every day and in every way the world is getting better. Everything will be all right. Behold the strength of our great institutions. We must stand for ever.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Daniel vs. the “Brain Trust”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The declarations of Belshazzar’s wise men did not please him; and it is just the same today. (5:9) The modern “brain trust”, including the clergy, and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy, make an effort and try to give advice to the political and financial ruling element, but the latter have little or no confidence in such advice. They become more perplexed every day, and know not which way to turn. That perplexity has continued to increase since 1929. There followed conference after conference looking to the recovery of the common interests of the nations, and an effort to prevent the disastrous effects of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house; and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.” (5:10) Evidently she was not Belshazzar’s wife, but the mother queen, because the account of the prophecy says that the wives were there drinking w<sup>T</sup>ine. She seems to picture some men of the world friendly to the ruling element and subject to them but who are entirely separate and apart from the religious frauds who pose as the spiritual advisers of the rulers. Some of such men and women are in public office and hold positions under the ruling powers. They have a kindly feeling toward Jehovah’s witnesses and believe that such witnesses represent the Lord. Therefore they make an honest endeavor to draw the attention of the high ruling element to such witnesses and to recommend that such witnesses are trustworthy and it is advisable that they be heard. Such friendly ones may be called persons of good will who have faith in God and believe that He has some representatives on earth, and for this reason they favorably commend Jehovah’s witnesses, even as the queen mother recommended Daniel to the king. Those who are willing to give Jehovah’s witnesses opportunity to talk believe that if these cannot give a true interpretation of the present distressing wmrld conditions and what the Bible has to say about the same, then no one else can, and certainly the hypocritical clergy have made such a miserable failure in giving explanation that it is time to give opportunity for those to talk who give evidence that they are really sincere and have the spirit of the Lord and know what they are talking about.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">“Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?” (5:13) That question required Daniel to identify himself as a Jew, that is, one of the people of Jehovah God who gives praise to Jehovah’s name and who was at that time in Satan’s world, Babylon, but not as part of it. Correspondingly, in the year 1931, Jehovah caused His faithful people to come up before the rulers of the world and to boldly confess their identity, that is, that they are those who give praise and service to Jehovah God and therefore are true Judeans. Representatively in a body, met in international convention at Columbus, Ohio, in July, 1931, the faithful remnant, in the resolution adopted at that time, accepted the gracious gift of Jehovah God, to wit, the “new name” given to them by Him, and adopted that new name which He had revealed to them, that is, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font11"> Since then God’s anointed servants on earth have been known as and called “Jehovah’s witnesses”, meaning Judeans in fact, that is, those who are wholly devoted to the praise and service of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Daniel was told that if he could give an honest and satisfactory explanation and interpretation of the handwriting on the wall he would receive great honor and distinction in the king’s realm. (5:14-17) But Daniel was not before the king for selfish gain. Those whom Daniel foreshadowed at this point, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, began to give answer before “the king”, that is, the ruling powers of the world, particularly from July 26, 1931, onward, and to do so in an effective manner by serving upon them the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font11"> the distribution of which was world-wide. The clergy were first served with that booklet, and then their allies, the political and financial element.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">That message delivered, and the reaction of “Christendom” to it, is all well summed up in the words of Jehovah’s prophet Daniel spoken to Belshazzar on the occasion of the feast, to wit: “And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.” (5:25) Daniel gave the interpretation, which foreshadowed the interpretation of Jehovah’s message of the present day. “Mene” (Aramaic) means “numbered”. The repeating of the word upon the wall twice showed two numberings. Jehovah numbered not only typical Babylon, but also the Greater Babylon, Satan’s organization. The first </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mene</span><span class="font11"> of the numbering of Babylon fixed the end of the “times of the Gentiles” (Luke 21: 24) for Babylon, and this as at A.D. 1914. The seven symbolic “times”, each of 360 years, began with Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon in 607 B.C.; necessarily they would end 2,520 years thereafter, to wit, A.D. 1914, at which time also the prophecy uttered by Christ Jesus began to be fulfilled.—Matthew 24: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The second “mene” would apply to the finishing, or ending, of Satan’s organization: ‘‘MENE: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end.” (5: 26, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font11"> The final end comes at the battle of Armageddon, just before which the witness work to the nations must be completed. (Matthew 24:14) The message, first promulgated at the Columbus convention July 26, 1931, and which appears in the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World, gave</span><span class="font11"> forth the notice and warning to the rulers of “Christendom” similar to the interpretation Daniel gave before Belshazzar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s prophet Daniel informed Belshazzar that his kingdom was done for and the reason thereof was, as Daniel stated: “TEKEL [meaning ‘Weighed’]; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.” The uninterrupted reign of great Babylon, Satan’s organization, came to an end in 1914. It was then weighed in the balance and found wholly wanting. The message of Jehovah by His witnesses declares concerning “Christendom” that she is weighed in the balances and found wanting. “Christendom’s” rulers are wanting in the fear of God, and this is shown by the fact that they spurn His message of truth and continue to profane the “vessels” of God, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses. “Christendom” is wanting in love for God and His kingdom, and they show this by continuing the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>End of Satanic Rule</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">At Armageddon the rulership of the world will be snatched away from Satan and taken over by Christ Jesus. “PERES; Thy kingdom is divided [dealt out], and given to the Medes and Persians.” (5: 28) In verse twenty-five the use of the word “upiiarsin” (the plural number of the word ‘Teres”, meaning “to split up”, “to deal,” “to distribute”) calls attention to two dividings or dealings-out, to wit: the dealing out of Babylon to Christ in A.D. 1914, when the Devil and his crowd were cast out of heaven and down to the earth (Revelation 12:7-12); and the second dealing-out, which takes place at the battle of Armageddon, when Satan’s organization is destroyed and the ruling of the world is completely taken over by Christ. Daniel’s use of the word “peres” in the singular number, in verse twenty-eight above quoted, seems to apply specifically to the final dividing or splitting up, at Armageddon, which is now yet future.— Daniel 7:13,14, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The rulership taken from Babylon was “given to the Medes and Persians”. The Medes seem to symbolically ‘ represent the invisible organization of the Lord God, which includes cherubim, seraphim, and angels. Cyrus, the invading Persian king, pictures Christ Jesus, the victorious Warrior who will clean out Satan’s organization, and the Persian army seems to picture the anointed ones of Jehovah on earth, members of the “body of Christ”. But it is the invisible army, led by Christ Jesus, that will destroy Satan’s organization. The part to be performed by the visible division of God’s army on earth, His witnesses, is merely that of declaring the day of God’s vengeance, calling attention to the ‘handwriting on the wall’, and announcing Jehovah’s purpose to destroy Satan’s rule and give the rulership to Christ Jesus. Such is the very part the Lord’s remnant on earth have been having and doing particularly since 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is certain that Satan’s seed, that is, those who now rule the earth, will be destroyed: “In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.” (5:30) It was the agency of Jehovah that did the slaying; hence there is here pictured the work of Jehovah’s Executive Officer enforcing the divine judgment, which is already written against Satan’s organization. At Armageddon, those who have oppressed the human race and shamefully dishonored God’s holy name and His kingdom, will come to an end, and Christ Jesus will do the executing of all the wicked ones. On that same day that Babylon fell back there Darius the Mede became the ruler of the nations of the world, and the Scriptures show that Darius pictured the Supreme Ruler, Jehovah God, the Most High. Cyrus, the second ruler, pictures Jehovah’s “heir of all things”, Christ Jesus, to whom Jehovah gives the Kingdom and all the nations of the earth as a possession. (Psalm 2: 8, 9) Daniel’s surviving the fall of Babylon suggests that the Greater Darius (Jehovah God) will keep alive at least part of the remnant during the battle of Armageddon and will grant to them some service on earth after the battle, which service will be to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.—Daniel 5:31; 6:28; 10:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">EFERRING to the battle between the oil companies as to who shall have control of the Gran Chaco oil fields, Bolivia, or Paraguay, it turns out that, most of the Paraguay men having been killed off, children of fourteen or fifteen years are being taken out of school and sent to the jungle to take up the cudgels. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cappers’ Weekly</span><span class="font11"> says: “Covered with vermin, ragged and hungry, they are told to fight other boys equally miserable and sick who speak the same language and have the same religion, but whose government happens to be financed by another oil concern.” The account goes on to say that 60,000 have already been slain; no mercy is shown to prisoners; there are chaplains on both sides, to encourage the boys to go on and murder one another. A latest innovation is that mothers can talk to their boys by means of the radio. A French writer declares that he saw whole companies of young soldiers weeping when the voices of their beloved were transmitted to them in the jungle. The Bolivians are said to be leaving the Roman church in great numbers.</span></p>

There are no advertisements; Mrs. Jackson did not have tea with Mrs. Smith on page 4; there is no puzzle contest on page 5.

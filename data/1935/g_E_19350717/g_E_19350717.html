<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Government at Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font6">HAT a setting for the proclamation of Jehovah’s government, made at Washington, D.C., on the occasion of the convention there of Jehovah’s witnesses, May 30 to June 3 inclusive, centering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> the Washington Auditorium, and centering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">about</span><span class="font6"> Judge Rutherford’s lecture on “Government”, delivered at 3:00 p.m., Sunday, June 2, 1935, published in full in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 411, June 19, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the United States, President Roosevelt declares that the finding of the NRA unconstitutional has set the country back to the horse-and-buggy days preceding the Civil War. In France, Premier Flandin pleads for a dictatorship and falls in a faint when it is refused; the bourse suspends and the cabinet resigns. In Britain, the coalition government can no longer carry on with MacDonald at the head and swaps for Baldwin in the middle of the stream. In Germany, a demonized tool of Big Business has destroyed all liberty and turned the country into a madhouse. In Italy, another dictator, facing financial ruin, arms the nation for war with its sister nation, Abyssinia, in utter disregard of the fact that both are members of the League of Nations. And so, around the world, “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity,” statesmen in utter confusion. “Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wisdom is in them?”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>“Rule Thou in the Midst of Thine Enemies”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">At Washington, D.C., Christ Jesus, the Anointed of Jehovah, reigned in the midst of His enemies, during the five days of the convention, in such a remarkable manner that even His enemies were compelled to grudgingly take notice of it. Thus the Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> on the day that it shamelessly prostrated itself before the Roman Catholic hierarchy by breaking its contract to publish Judge Rutherford’s great address on “Government”, felt compelled to say: “Yesterday’s gathering broke records for a religious meeting in the history of the city.” (The general manager of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> Eugene MacLean, resigned on June 5, two days after the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post’s </span><span class="font6">collapse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font6"> said: “Police estimated between 20,000 and 25,000 persons jammed in and around the building yesterday to hear the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, or Jehovah’s witnesses, deliver his speech on ‘Government’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> said: “The main floor of the auditorium was packed. The balcony was filled to overflowing. . . . Throngs lined the sidewalks outside the building, unable to gain entrance. . . . Loud-speakers which operated with unusual clarity brought the voices of the speakers outside the building.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>A Preliminary Announcement</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Plainfield (N.J.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> having acquired advance information of what would occur at Washington, said in its issue of May 31, 1935, on its front page, beneath a scarehead eight columns wide:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“GOVERNMENT” will be the subject of an address of universal interest to be given by Judge Rutherford on Sunday, June 2, 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, in the Washington Auditorium. This address will be simultaneously flashed by WOL and the most unique and extensive combination of wire and wireless communications facilities and publicaddress appliances ever arranged on this planet. The United States will be covered from coast to coast with a network of stations, making it possible for everyone in the United States to listen in, as well as the greater part of the Canadian population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition, the address will be carried by radiotelephone to England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and South Africa; and by shortwave radio beams to Switzerland, Central America, South America, the Hawaiian and the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, Siam, India, Australia, New Zealand, Java and isles afar. At Buenos Aires, Honolulu and Manila the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">address will be rebroadcast by powerful local stations. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a large auditorium at London there will be a publie-address system to carry the address to those in attendance. From London the address will be carried on telephone lines to Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast, in all of which cities of the British Isles there will be similar public-address meetings. There will also be public-address systems at Geneva and Berne, Switzerland; at Paris, France; Brussels, Belgium; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and cities in South Africa and in Australia. In Australia a network of at least 26 stations will serve the people of that continent with this extraordinary message concerning Jehovah’s government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This announcement was reflected faithfully in the responses, many of which are reproduced in this issue.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>A Flood of Letters</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">A flood of letters followed the deluge of radiograms, cablegrams and telegrams. Two of these were published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font6">No. 411, June 19, 1935. Others appear herein, selected from the thousands received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Denmark. Copenhagen: “All were impressed by the faet that this lecture was really going ‘to the ends of the earth’. The thought gripped the imagination. I have heard American broadcasts over London, but never so clear as this one.”—D. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">England. Leicester: “How strange,it seemed, that it was 9 p.m. with us, but was 3 p. m. at Washington! Promptly at nine we heard the voice of the chairman making his opening announcements, and by the clar</span><span class="font5">ity of the speech we realized at once that our great Jehovah had once more blessed His servants. The singing of the audience came through well. . . . The lecture was grand, the audience at Birmingham joining in the enthusiastic applause with which the president’s remarks were punctuated. We also joined in the mighty chorus of ‘Aye’ to the proposition at the close. I was much impressed with the singular lack of disturbance, sometimes caused by ‘atmospherics’. There was also a pronounced absence of ‘fading’. All together it was a wonderful and memorable occasion.”—F. R. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">London : “You will know, of course, from the radiogram sent from here of the fine meeting we had in the [Alexandra] Palace, and of the very good reception of the lecture. I wish I had words to describe it. . . . The meeting did not begin till 9:00 p. m., but by 7:30 the hall was filling up. It was exciting to hear the electricians talking with each other of the arrangements being made. They were talking with Glasgow, Newcastle, Belfast, Manchester and Birmingham, and with Sydney, Australia, asking each other of their arrangements. It was exciting because everybody knew that nothing of the kind had been done before. It made us feel that the world was not so very big, after all. Then at about ten minutes to nine we heard the first voice from Washington, telling us that the lecture would soon be heard, that there were great crowds in the building and all around and that the day was fine. Then at a few seconds to nine there was the voice of the one who called for two verses of No. 42, and then the singing. We all felt so near as if we were there with you all. Then at once eame Judge Rutherford’s voice. Every word was heard distinctly, from first to last; and the audience in the Palace were with the audience in Washington; when they clapped hands, we did it too; when they cheered, we cheered. And at the end we shouted ‘Aye’ as quickly as in Washington. There were many wet eyes to be seen, in thankfulness for this new and great witness to our great Jehovah and for this wonderful way of speaking to all the earth, for we knew there were many other places in the earth where the same feelings were being expressed and for the same reason.”—Mrs. J. H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Estonia. Tallinn: “Heard very well on a shortwave receiving set. ... It was also well heard at Tapa and at Weru. The reception was very good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lithuania. Kaunas: “It is with great joy that we inform you that Judge Rutherford’s voice was distinctly heard yesterday from what must have been RCACI 28.87 meters, San Francisco (Manila relay). Apart from almost negligible ‘fading’, and although full ‘volume’ was not used, Judge Rutherford’s voice was as clear as if he had been in the same room.” —L. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norway, Oslo. “It was a wonderful event to hear Judge Rutherford’s enthusiastic and forceful presen</span><span class="font5">tation of the message and the spontaneous applause several times during the lecture. And so we were along at Washington convention and at the close we rose up and shouted ‘Aye’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sweden. Stockholm: ‘‘Judge Rutherford’s speech from Washington was transmitted to Stockholm, from Rugby, England, via Copenhagen, Denmark, through the various post office services. A hall was rented and it was advertised that English-speaking people could come and listen there, free. . . . The reception was good; in fact, so good that P. O. engineers stated they had never heard such good transmission across the Atlantic, and were rather surprised. . . . The publicity given to the truth and to the witness being given at Washington was very valuable, and reports are to the effect that it has been noted quite a bit among the public in various parts, and this in spite of the fact that all the papers refused to carry any other notice about it, only the paid advertisement. ’ ’—W.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ontario. Fort Erie: ‘‘I would like to have been in the audience at Washington to applaud your speech on June 2. However, as it was, I heard it at home and enjoyed it immeasurably. I am always looking forward to your broadcasts. It is too bad that there was not more time to elucidate to greater extent on the clergy frauds. ... I want to tell you that I was disgusted beyond measure with the management of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto when I was there in your audience last summer, for not having the loud-speaker working. I regarded it then and now as a dirty, rotten, low-down trick; and I heard plenty of unfavorable comment in their direction from plenty of others like myself who could get only snatches of your voice and who felt that we were most unnecessarily cheated by the M. L. G. management. If it had been one of those blabbermouths whose blither monopolizes the radio there would have been every facility imaginable available to put across the program, which would likely have been some kind of self-justification for some body of religious racketeering frauds, or for some political organization or patting some poor pimp on the back who ought to be serving a sentence at hard labor; and they would have been literally under sueh pussyfooters’ feet in their anxiety to please his sponsors. I could go on like that ‘far into the night’ giving vent to my disgust and contempt for such things in general of which there is a surplus. I hope to be able to help in a financial w’ay, and expect to remit within the year fifty dollars.”—B. A. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arizona. Phoenix: “ ‘Thank God for Judge Rutherford and Jehovah’s witnesses,’ is what we said after listening to your lecture June 2 from Washington and which we received here over station KOY; reception splendid. You are doing the greatest work being done today. How I long to join in the work the witnesses are doing, but cannot on account of health, which is very bad. The lecture Sunday was </span><span class="font5">just exactly according to our needs today. . . . </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">certainly vote ‘Aye’, a thousand times ‘Aye’. May God’s protection be over you.”-Mr. and Mrs. D. F. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">California. Eureka: ‘‘There is a radio installed and running on Sundays and holidays at the park here. The people who have no radio go there Sundays to hear Judge Rutherford at 10: 30. June 2, at 12: 00 noon, there were hundreds of them gathered there to hear Judge Rutherford speak on ‘Government’ from Washington, D. C. As nearly as I could find out there were more than a thousand, and they all stood up and shouted ‘Aye’. Reception was fine.”—F. B. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pasadena: ‘‘I am so glad I heard you today over KNX. Thank God He has given you the power to so clearly give His law so well. I want that sermon to read and give to others who did not hear you. I hope to hear you deliver more of God’s truths, and may God spare you to teach us longer. I am 81 years old, but never heard sueh a sermon. I can yet hear your voice, as it rang out clear as a bell and without fear of anyone who might oppose. Again, God bless and keep you.”—Dr. S. L. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">San Francisco: “I have just listened to your wonderful lecture, broadcast from Washington, D. C., which impressed me very much. I thank God for such men as you, and may the spirit of God for ever inspire you to such constructive activities. I would like to have you mail copies of this lecture as per list, and enclose remittance to pay for mailing. I wish I were able to send you more, as I would love to contribute to the cause which you uphold. May the multitudes listen to and heed your vital, Godgiven messages, and may you be repaid by the voice of God saying, ‘Well done, my good and faithful servant.’ Best wishes to you and for you.”—S. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Instruments of Publicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington is a city of 500,000 inhabitants. Baltimore, forty miles away, is of equal size. There were few inhabitants of either city that did not know Jehovah’s witnesses were in Washington, or that the Government of Jehovah would be proclaimed by radio on a stupendous scale, at 3:00 p.m. Sunday, June 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Washington 40 sound cars, 18 of them with reproducing equipment, patrolled the city at all seasonable hours, calling attention to the lecture, and when the lecture was given those with reproducing equipment rebroadcast the address so that it could be heard for miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persons entering or leaving Washington by any of the four principal highways were confronted with booths where traffic information was dispensed with one hand and invitations to hear the lecture with the other. Similar information was dispensed at Union Station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fliers were distributed for lecture reception in Classic Cinema, Belfast, Ireland; Coliseum Cinema, Glasgow, Scotland; City Hall, New-castle-on-Tyne, England; Paramount Cinema, Manchester, England, and the Town Hall, Birmingham, England. At London, England, red and blue posters 12^ by 18y<sub>2</sub> inches were used so effectively that 4,000 listened at Alexandra Palace. The transmission throughout England was carried out by British Post Office expert engineers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound cars at Washington rendered wonderful service. Not only did they extend some 9,791 verbal invitations to ‘whosoever heard’, but in the parks, where they performed such excellent rebroadcasts, taxi-drivers leaned over their wheels to catch every word, policemen drifted up and joined the throng, and passersby paused, and formed a great standing army. Thousands were seated in the parks, also, and at the end it was a marvelous sight as the whole audience rose up as one man and shouted “Aye”. So great was the throng that street cars were held up until the streets were cleared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of June 5, 1935, the Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> said: “Jehovah’s witnesses have gone, but in Washington they left their mark.” The burden of the paper’s story that opens with the foregoing sentence is that the Washington police department’s head ruled that sound cars are barred from the city’s streets, and that the ban is a direct result of the extensive soundcar activities of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound truck department had its headquarters across the Potomac, convenient to a pasture. Workers noted that when the speeches were broadcast it had a remarkable effect upon the domestic animals. They stretched up their necks, their ears stiffened, and the horses kicked up their heels and ran away from the sound, while the cows kicked up their heels and ran toward it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford’s speech on ‘Government’ was sent out not only from Brussels, Berne and Amsterdam, but also from the receiving station at the League of Nations, Geneva; and one wonders what effect was produced when the sentence came over: “Jehovah has expressly declared that the League of Nations is a fraud and a snare and shall be completely destroyed.” No report indicates that the lecture was cut off anywhere in Europe, but it was cut off in two places in the United States, through fear of the Roman Catholic hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There seems to be a certain amount of liberty in the air in Switzerland. Thus, the United States consul at Berne asked the Society’s representative there, and in all good faith and sincerity, “When do you think the battle of Armageddon will begin?” But the Father has kept that in His own power, and no man knows; so the consul is still waiting for his answer.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Opening Session</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When the convention opened on Thursday, May 30, the throng that had already assembled filled the large auditorium, while others continued to come, until the surrounding parks, smaller halls, passages and basement were filled. By dint of improvised ‘traffic regulations’ and good-natured efforts at co-operation, the jam was just a comfortably tolerable one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Publishers naturally all wanted to get into the Auditorium, but those seated in the parks, while unable to see the speakers, had the delightful compensation of balmy breezes and clear reception in nature’s pleasant surroundings. One saw a little bird hopping about on the grass directly under the chairs, seemingly sure of his safety though surrounded by thousands of people. He seemed to know he was in the right place, and was content that, for the present, other two-legged birds should share his lawn.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Jehovah’s Identification of “Great Multitude”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The discourse at Washington that represented the greatest amount of careful preparation was not the public address on “Government”, which traveled quite familiar ground, and it was certainly not the impromptu speech which brought down the house on Monday afternoon, June 3, a digest of which appeared in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 411, beginning at page 581.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As all who were at the convention were well aware, the special treat for God’s people who were gathered in the capital city was Jehovah’s identification of the “great multitude” (Revelation 7:9-17) as one and the same with the “Jonadabs” (2 Kings 10:15-23) and the “millions now living that will never die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the discourse by Judge Rutherford Friday afternoon, May 31,1935, at 5: 00 p.m., which discourse was broadcast on a chain of stations in the East, including the Society’s own station WBBR, at Staten Island, New York, this perplexing question was settled to the full satisfaction of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For more than fifty years it has been known that at the end of Satan’s kingdom and the inauguration of Jehovah’s kingdom &quot;a great multitude” would come into prominence that would render valiant service to earth’s new King, and many have wondered that this multitude (which it was once thought would be a spirit-begotten class) should be so slow in making its appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the mystery is all cleared up. Though they are only now being recognized as such, the “great multitude” have been working side by side with the remnant for some years. It is as though two good friends would go into battle side by side, and together be wounded and imprisoned and released and finally go to a picnic together and there discover for the first time that they came from the same town and had really known each other for almost a lifetime, but under other names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the workers had to remain at Brooklyn headquarters to look after the broadcast of this lecture, and other matters, and after the lecture was over expressed their huge satisfaction in the following personal dispatch to Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah’s</span><span class="font6"> identification 'great multitude’ broadcast excellently by WBBR gratefully appreciated by thrilled watchers at Watchtower and Bethel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not the purpose here to attempt a digest of this epoch in the history of Jehovah’s people, further than to say that it was an eyeopener to everybody that the “great tribulation” out of which the great multitude comes is a tribulation not upon the people of God, but upon the Devil and his crowd, which tribulation is now manifest on every hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> should be a reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> in which the whole subject will be discussed in a series of articles to be published sometime within the ensuing year. It is a subject which has many ramifications, and Jehovah’s people, given a foretaste of it at the Washington convention, look forward with keenest zest to what they know awaits them in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> on this highly important subject.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>A Service Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The convention at Washington was a service convention, first, last, and all the time, and the grandest spirit of service was manifested at all times by all who were present. The first thing on the program each day was service, and many interesting items in this connection will be brought to notice. At the moment, however, attention is upon the discourses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Question Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question meeting was a feature much enjoyed. About forty questions were fired at Judge Rutherford, some of them stickers, too, but all answered as quickly as they were asked, many of the answers meeting with laughter and applause from his hearers, and all of them with great appreciation. The questions, previously submitted in writing, were shot at him by the chairman, M. A. Howlett.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. How can I decide whether I am of the Jonadab class or of the anointed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Suppose you could not decide it, what difference would it make? You were in a still greater mix-up when you were in the Devil’s organization, but now you have been brought out of the kingdom of darkness and into God’s marvelous light and it should not make the slightest difference to you whether you will ultimately be in heaven or upon the earth. If you remain upon the earth it will not be long now until you will meet Abraham, David, and a few of those other good boys of whom the apostle says that ‘the world was not worthy of them’. What difference does it make what kind of an organism you have, if you are in God’s organization? If it can be said of you that you are one of those of whom the world is not worthy, praise the Lord. I think it would be rather presumptive of me to say whether you will be in the one place or in the other. I have been trying to serve the Lord consistently for 25 years at least, but it is such a happy and glorious thing to serve Jehovah God that if He should say to me, “You are going to be on the earth forever,” I would be well content. To live on the earth forever is such a privilege that it may not be described in human phrase. We who are here before the Lord know that we have made a full surrender to the Lord without any reference to the reward. One used to sometimes hear the expression “I am consecrated to death”, meaning by that that he anticipated that as a result of that kind of consecration he would be called upon to help rule the world. Such were not begotten of the spirit at all. Nor should one say, “I want to live on the earth forever.” What all should say to Jehovah is, “Whatever you want to do with me, that is the best thing that could happen.” Anyone who makes a consecration with a condition attached to it shows his selfishness. The true spirit is the spirit of our Master, “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.” ‘Whatever is thy will, that will I do: I am going to serve wherever I am put.’ ‘The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him. ’ How may we know we have the witness of the spirit? The spirit bears this testimony in two separate and distinct ways: one, by the Word of the Lord; the other, by the way in which He deals with us. If you are willing to suffer the reproaches that came upon Christ Jesus, and to do it with a grateful heart, that is strong evidence that you are one of God’s sons. This text, however, applies more particularly prior to 1918. The Jonadab class, or great multitude class, was not then in existence. Notice what the Lord says in Zephaniah 2: 2, 3: ‘ Seek meekness, seek righteousness: it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font5"> be that ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.’ It all depends upon the conditions. One may be moved by selfishness in making a consecration, and not seek meekness and righteousness. Some may stop after receiving a knowledge of the truth, and never make any more progress. Such would not stand much of a chance of being preserved in Armageddon. That is why it says &quot;It </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">may be”.</span><span class="font5"> But the wholly faithful may wholly rely upon this promise. ‘ ‘ The Lord know-eth them that are his.” It would be presumptive in me to try to draw a line of demarcation; for I do not know what the Lord has kept in His own hands. But I do know that if you have made a full and unconditional consecration to do the will of God, and your whole affection is set upon Jehovah and His kingdom, if you have entirely left the Devil’s organization and unequivocally taken your stand on the side of God’s organization, and are giving praise to Jehovah, then you have the testimony of the Lord that you are on His side, and happy is your lot. Why should such worry? How many think you should worry under such conditions? I saw but one hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Has the opportunity to get into the Anointed ceased?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. As long as there is a danger of anyone’s falling away, the Lord can arrange for someone to fill up the ranks. Serve the Lord and leave it to Him. I think the Royal House is complete now, but some may fall away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. If one is a Jonadab, is he immune from natural death from now until Armageddon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Suppose one has a wreck of his car and is killed? The Lord can wake him up. There is no insurance policy that your old frame may not crack up before that time eomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Is it a correct thought that great numbers of the &quot;great multitude” are still in the churches?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. It is not a correct thought. Those who are in the &quot;great multitude”, the Jonadabs, are out of the Devil’s organization, and are not supporting it. But it may be quite true that there are still many in the churches who will get out and who may be accounted worthy to get into the “great multitude”, and will take their stand, soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Is it proper for Jonadabs to refer to themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. The Jonadabs are servants of Jehovah God, doing His will, and commanded by Him to give the water of life freely to those with whom they come in contact. They are not witnessing for the Devil, but are witnessing for God, and it is quite right for them to say, &quot;I bring you a message from Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. In meetings, may the Jonadabs meet with and study with the elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Certainly they may do so, but that does not mean that the Jonadabs are elders. The elders are the ones that are mature in Christ. Let the Jonadabs meet with them and ask and answer questions, and if asked to pray, they should do it, for they pray through Christ Jesus just as well as those who are of the anointed. They have every right so to do, for they are on the Lord’s side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jonadab Work in Los Angeles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would have been a pleasure to print all or most, or at least some, of each of the foregoing addresses (Harbeck’s thrilling talk on the work in central Europe was especially appreciated), but as they w<sup>T</sup>ere all based upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver </span><span class="font6">articles already in print the reader is referred thereto for the careful consideration of each theme; and limited space makes it impossible to make more than one selection from the five symposium addresses, but the Jonadab work in Los Angeles is of such immediate and outstanding interest that considerable space is devoted to the report of C. V. Knemeyer, Los Angeles service director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How to make the best use of the Jonadabs in the Los Angeles territory gave us considerable concern. Then the light came respecting Jonadab’s relationship to Jehu, and we concluded there must be some way these could be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During a set period publishers were asked to turn in the names of people supposed to be interested. Four thousand were turned in, and 600 of these proved to be really interested. These were given special assignments in their own neighborhood, and were asked to give handbills to butchers, bakers and bill collectors, but were not counted as publishers until they actually went out in the field. This plan proved to be an immediate success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Helping the Jonadabs into the work is not a one-man job: there is a responsibility on each one, but those engaged in the work find it most enjoyable, and, in fact, there is a waiting list. This is not because it is easy, for those who are assisting the Jonadabs are putting in regular hours in addition. Only those who engage in field work are fitted to do this, and it is all extra work. Reports of Jw’s and Jonadabs are kept separate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Brother Rutherford’s lecture on the “great multitude ’' I wired that there was a tremendous work ahead, and the reply came back that there were more carloads registered for duty than in any previous campaign, and that despite the fact that there were 125 away from the company. No doubt this is the opening gun and we shall now see a great increase in interest. It takes a lot of plugging, but there are results: the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> studies have increased forty percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To inaugurate a meeting in a certain home recently we sent around a sound truck and, just before the meeting, put on one of the musical records. As a result, the house could not hold those that came. All indicated that they were interested, and most of them took the literature. The friends at Los Angeles are more interested in this good-will work than in anything else: 215 are steadily engaged in it; and from now on we will push the work harder than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out at the municipal air port the first visit with the sound truck was so effective that after the lecture started there were actually those that engaged in a fist fight, to preserve order. Those that were interested obtained literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother with peculiar zeal was given an assignment to work for three weeks in a territory of six blocks. Out of 30 persons that he found interested he had 9 out in the work after the three weeks were ended. During April over 13,000 attended the sound car transcription and phonograph meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When requests are made of the Jonadabs of the Los Angeles company to engage in volunteer service, the response is like “marching in the tops of the mulberry trees” (2 Samuel 5:24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham').</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work carried on by the Jonadab department has been more or less of an experiment, but seems to be functioning smoothly now, as meetings with these special publishers have helped to iron out difficulties, and bulletins with suggestions and instructions are issued to those doing this special work. There are about 50 who are now engaging in regular field service, and these have been transferred to the company directory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following information has been obtained from the monthly reports turned in on 170 good-will people who are being visited and reported on, on a regular monthly basis:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(e) This indicates the number of good-will people who have taken an active part in the field service... that is, door-to-door witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">During his address on “The Great Multitude” Judge Rutherford asked the Jonadabs present to raise their hands. The number present was very large, as may be gathered from the fact that 840 were immersed.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Pioneers' Greatest Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneer attendance at Washington exceeded that of any previous convention, the enrollment reaching 1,535. This included nearly 150 from Canada, as well as pioneers from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and France. Every state in the Union was represented. Twelve signed up as pioneers, and six as auxiliaries, while the convention was in session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers began to arrive many days in advance of the convention, many of them aiding in the preparation, and by Saturday the 25th they were arriving in large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anticipating the financial strain, arrangements were made to furnish many with lodging at very low cost, and some at no charge. At Anacostia two buildings which were formerly a colored boys’ school were rented, holding over 180 men and women, one building being assigned to men and the other to women. Army cots and straw mattresses were furnished for the women, the men being content with mattresses, both two-story buildings being practically filled. An armory was obtained at Silver Springs, Md., and also one at Kensington, Md. In the first, having a capacity of approximately 300,100 men and women were accommodated, it not being necessary to use the one in Kensington, although mattresses and other equipment were available if needed. All together, 600 or more straw mattresses were made by those preparing for the convention. Some of these were used in the private rooms at the Auditorium. Over 400 blankets were loaned to the convention. Some were supplied with work in the cafeteria and kitchen, where they were provided with food gratis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The majority of the pioneers came with their own housing equipment; and the pioneer camp, located in a beautiful wooded valley across the Potomac at Arlington, was the largest assembly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">field equipment of the Lord’s organization up to this time. The encampment embraced 25 house-cars, more than 150 trailers, and over 150 tents, a total of 325 pieces of equipment, in addition to the hundreds of passenger cars. A close estimate of the population of the camp is 1200 of Jehovah’s witnesses, and one goat from Texas. The pioneers bore the expense of renting the property and the cost of the water and electricity used, by paying a charge of 50c for each outfit there during the entire period; 25c for those who came in for only the latter part of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The camp was one of the highlights of the convention and was the show place for travelers, taxi-drivers, airplanes and dirigibles. It was one of the most joyful spots of the convention. No one did any complaining. The variety of equipment was one of the striking features of the camp. Some of the cars and trailers were the acme of modern beauty and convenience, while others were the unique and ingenious contrivances of limited financial resources. The majority of trailers and house-cars manifested gratifying progress and improvement over the equipment at previous conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers at the camp were not talking about “Arlington” or “Washington’s home” or “Lincoln Memorial”. They had more important things to talk of and to think of than these emblems of the honor of men, which is not of God. Uppermost in their minds was the significance of the text, “For Jehovah and for Gideon!” No sightseeing or vacationing for them, and small loss they consider it. They are too busy calling attention to the passing of the old world and the foundation of the new, of which Christ is King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If seeing the camp was an inspiration, staying there for a day or two, including nights, was an education. When driving in, one wonders, by the time the far end of the camp is reached, how the pioneers got their cars and trailers to their destination. It was the roughest road one could imagine, symbolic of the rough road the pioneers travel as they go forth proclaiming the “glad tidings of great joy”. One pioneer’s outfit fell to pieces trying to get located, and he was without a home; but the rest chipped in, and built him a better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pioneer outfit usually consists of an automobile, a trailer for living quarters, and some kind of sound equipment, whether this be a phonograph, transcription machine, or sound equipment which was specially built for the car and had horns which sounded the message abroad from the roof of the car. With some of them, anything that can be pulled on two wheels is a trailer, anything that has a motor and steering wheel and runs is an automobile; and, of course, anyone who is fully devoted to Jehovah and willing to give all his time to the service of the Lord is a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And do they take their work seriously? Anything in print that comes from “headquarters” is devoured with avidity. It is considered carefully, prayerfully. Nothing is overlooked: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, The Golden Age— </span><span class="font6">all are welcomed with open arms. The Lord!s business is their “big business”, compared with which the commercial activities of the world are insignificant, though they be housed in skyscraper palaces. Their big business is to magnify the Lord’s name; and how they love to do it! They have little of this world’s goods; they are rich in faith!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first day the campers were there, the day the convention opened, brought a rainstorm, which turned the camp into a “sea of mud”. It looked bad, but the mud dried up quickly, and the rest of the time the convention enjoyed ideal weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 6: 30 in the morning the camp was a bustle and hum of activity. But when a sound car announced that the morning text and comments would be read, everything was quiet as though there weren’t a living thing in it. Everyone listened attentively. After the reading the buzzing activity was resumed. After a night’s rest in and under cars, in tents, and in trucks, anywhere and everywhere, “sleeping the sleep of the just,” the pioneers were ready for action. Many of the men made their toilet outside, probably leaving the inside of the trailer for the women. (There isn’t much room in a trailer.) It was a funny sight to see the various means employed and positions taken in accomplishing the morning shave. Cracked mirrors, automobile mirrors and windshields or windows—anything that would give a reflection was used to accomplish the desired end. One little “shaver” stood on a stepladder to enable him to look in the mirror on a car. (Either he was little or the mirror was too high to reach otherwise.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shaving and toilettes accomplished, breakfast, tasty and substantial enough, was taken on the jump. There wasn’t time for frills, but everybody was happy as a lark. The camp was serviced like a regular little city. The butcher, the baker, the newsboy, the milkman and the grocerymen made regular visits and, as was to be expected, got the witness concerning the Kingdom well impressed on their minds. Even pioneers must eat, and, true to His promise, the Lord provides for their needs, “in some way or other.” One pioneer had a goat, which, we are told, travels on the running board. The goat provides fine nourishing milk for the family, and amusement for the children as well. In the estimation of this pioneer, and some others, no pioneer equipment is really complete without a goat. Goat milk cannot be excelled for healthful quality, and the goat will graze and get its food anywhere “in some way or other”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the pioneers, bright and early, pulled off for the first feature of the day, “service,” and the camp became like a deserted city.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Report of Field Activities</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">At the Washington convention there were 8,390 publishers actually out in the field: they were in the care of 1,514 car drivers: they placed 16,176 bound books and 194,020 booklets. These publishers put in 56,050 hours in the work, and placed literature with 56,075 obtainers. The number of sound cars engaged in broadcasting announcements of the lecture “Government” varied from 7 to 34 upon the six occasions when they went out in the announcement service. The aggregate of 139 cars (for the six occasions) traversed 9,013 miles and made 9,791 announcements. Number of sound cars rebroadcasting the “Government” lecture in Washington, 3; outside of Washington, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was very noticeable that those attending the convention were very orderly, and their sole purpose for being at the convention was to receive the blessings in store for them, and especially to have a part in the honoring of Jehovah’s name in the field service work. There seemed to be very little loitering or gossiping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the meetings were held the brethren were in their seats, or, if there were no seats and they were standing, they were attentively enjoying the food provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The factory at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y., was privileged to do the largest portion of the printing for the convention, as well as furnishing the convention with the signs. All of the radio folders, of which over 5,500,000 copies were printed, were put through the presses at 117 Adams Street. Special announcements for the Washington Auditorium were also furnished, 200,000 of these being used to cover the entire city of Washington. The various forms and information folders were also printed by the Society, as well as the programs. Report cards, registration slips, tickets for the bookstore, and hundreds of signs were also furnished.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Service Maps and Preparations</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Preparatory to the convention all the territory within 75 miles of Washington was divided into 2,322 territories, and maps were provided so that in the rural areas every worker could have one—four maps to a car. In a city that is at present badly overcrowded, pleasant accommodations were provided for 20,000 persons, in itself a great undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It sometimes became necessary to send troops to another front, on account of the tactics of the enemy. Thus, a special service had been planned for Monday, June 3. The workers rose very early and were in their places at 7: 00 a.m., but the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> had fallen down and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> had gone out, so the workers were directed to return to the Auditorium for instructions. They left their cars and walked to the hall, a distance of twelve blocks or more. The doormen of the government buildings came out to watch them pass, the gardeners ceased work, and the police stood wondering what it was all about, while the “locusts” filed by nine thousand strong.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>A Glimpse of God’s Organization</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It required a typewritten book of eighty pages </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">set out the plans and specifications for the Washington convention. It is a big job to plan at one and the same time for the greatest worldwide witness, the greatest witness at the nation’s capital, and all the needs, of every kind, of 20,000 visitors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To house the daily reports the carpenter division made two chests, each with interior dimensions 30 by 36 by 12 inches. They built all the booths and tables in the cafeteria, the shower baths and toilets at the pioneer camp, and the desks and booths which served as offices of the administration not only at the Washington Auditorium, but on all the principal highways leading into the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An example of field service: The Freeman Hospital (colored) was visited, and sixty pieces of literature were placed with the patients. The superintendent appointed nurses to guide the party of five to the wards. The matron asked where the meetings are regularly held, and stated that she wished to attend them. While Judge Rutherford’s broadcast lecture was being given a sound car stood outside the hospital and broadcast the lecture for the benefit of the patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The conventioners were not able to entirely offset the achievement of the Devil in putting the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> out of commission, but they did something right away, and more later. On June 3 they distributed 75,000 mimeographed statements of the essential facts in the case (followed within two days by the resignation of the general manager of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> who seems justly indignant at the light in which he was placed by the men higher up), and on June 9 and 10 the city was covered with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 411, which presents the same facts and many more, with proofs that the facts are facts. The American republic is writhing in the grasp of the Roman Catholic hierarchy’s devilish tentacles, and her alleged statesmen and Big Business representatives have become mere eunuchs in the hierarchy’s hands.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>A Service Not on the Program</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Much of the finest service rendered at Washington was in the homes where the conventioners were entertained. The following was handed in by one of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> reporters, to show the vast difference in spirit between the Catholic people who love God and the Catholic hierarchy who love themselves:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We were invited to pull our trailer up in the shade of a great maple tree, where quiet and beauty, with a welcome from the heart, made the dream of tired and nervous pioneers come true. We looked no further for the big pioneer camp across the Potomac; ours would be here. While our trailer lights were being hooked up to a convenient socket on the front porch, and we were being invited to get water from the lawn faucet, and to come in and get ice from the Frigidaire, we learned that our benefactors were ‘good Catholics’. They </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font5"> really and truly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Two of our pioneer friends, Mrs. J. H. Donovan, of Savannah, Ga., and Mrs. Etta P. Foster, of Montgomery, Ala., were to arrive by train, and were registered for service throughout the convention in our car. When we went to claim the room assigned to our southern friends over on Wisconsin avenue, it had long been permanently rented to an outsider. Hearing of this, Mrs. E----at once found that she</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">had a nice room, and at the pioneer rate, for our friends. Although Mrs. Foster stayed an extra day, no money would be accepted therefor; nor was any money acceptable in payment for the electricity consumed by our well lighted trailer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The night preceding the opening of the memorable convention an automobile from a far distant state, filled with witnesses, and drawing a trailer with five or six additional witnesses aboard, drove in alongside of us while we were out. We did not hear them tell of their long journey and weariness; we did not witness the usual unmurmuring little sigh at the information that the camp site had been changed across the city. What we did see on our return was threatening weather out of the northwest, Mr. E—’s brand-new ear standing outdoors in front of us, and his garage filled with these visiting witnesses from afar on their army cots; then ensued the long drizzling rain. In the morning these witnesses went on their way, refreshed by rest and by human kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The following night we noticed Mr. E—’s new car again standing out in the weather. It thus continued till the morning after the great conclave had ended. During this time the E—s’ unused bedspring furnished nightly rest to another pair of Jehovah’s witnesses from Louisville, Ky., who carried, meantime, the garage key. On their turning back the key, I heard Mr. E---- deny them the opportunity of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">clearing up the garage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Early in the convention Mrs. E---- told us that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">her Catholic friend had called her up and told her that we were such awful people, and that we were against the Catholics; why would she have us there ? Later on her Catholic friend again called up to tell of the awful things that Judge Rutherford had said on Sunday afternoon ‘about the government’; but Mrs. E----seemed to prefer to listen to us, and, en</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tirely without suggestion on our part, to loan us such things as rubbers and raincoat and umbrella on the rainy morning, and blocks of ice from her Frigidaire on the hot days, to say nothing of the cake and fruit and other things; and she even suggested to her Catholic friend that if she did not like to listen to Judge Rutherford’s radio lecture, why didn’t she turn it off?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The above is reported merely as a wee illustration of the great fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are not against the Catholics. There are millions of sincere and honest Catholics, many of whom attend early mass as the E—s do, and some of these already begin to sense the insincerity and hypocrisy of their misleaders. Jehovah’s witnesses are ready to lay down their lives, if need be, to bring to these good people the true message of Jehovah God and His kingdom. Our message is fok and not against the Catholic people. Christ died for these and we love them.’’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Other Good Declarations</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The declaration meetings featured the Jona-dab work. One of them said that when confronted by three policemen he had told the officers that when God’s kingdom is in full operation there will be no need for the clergy, no need for the police, and no need for the judges, but love for God wall be in every heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Jonadab, imbued with the real spirit of service, had brought her landlady with her to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The service director of the Glasgow (Scotland) company had found a Jonadab that very morning who was rejoicing in Judge Rutherford’s books, and was reading them when he called. He was pleased when he found that “the people here are just like they are in Glasgow”. It may be doubted that he knows as yet that there are more persons of Scotch descent in the United States than there are in bonnie Scotland itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister who was just out of prison in time to attend the convention made a declaration. While she was in the prison her son brought her food. When she came out, so she said, “the angel of the Lord came with me, and we made it,” that is, got to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher related how he found the truth. He picked up a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in a railroad station one morning about three o’clock. A policeman standing by asked, ‘What have you there, something religious ?” He replied, “Yes, but I am not much interested.” However, they read the paper, and the result was that both the publisher and the policeman came into the truth, and both are now Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another publisher found a Jonadab who said to him, “I want to go to one of your meetings.” The result of that statement was that a little company was formed, and out of it, in a few weeks, two Jonadabs went to prison for thirty days and one of them for forty days, and a mother and her sister, and eight of her folks were out in the work. This mother had prayed that she might meet one of Jehovah’s witnesses; and God answered her prayer by giving her a share in the work itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher from Kingston, Jamaica, said he was thankful for the great privilege of coming two thousand miles across the seas to attend the convention of a people for Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One publisher found at the convention a cousin he had never seen in his life; both were in the service of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher from Boston was out in the work and came to the door of a Hebrew. Looking at some of the literature the Hebrew noticed that it was Christian literature, and summoned the police, declaring that the man was out of his head. The publisher was taken to a psychopathic ward in a hospital, and there met a physician he had known for eighteen years. The physician asked him, “What are you doing here?” The publisher replied, “That is what I am asking you.” A general laugh followed all round, and the publisher was granted his liberty, and came to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher from Oregon had come with 15 others, in a school bus, 3,600 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher from southern Georgia said: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“1 </span><span class="font6">served the Devil and his organization for ten years as a Baptist minister; for the last four years I have been serving Jehovah God, as one of His witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A publisher from Dallas found an old lady, 89 years of age, who had first got a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery,</span><span class="font6"> in magazine form, then </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font6"> and finally all the other books, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> When the publisher called upon her she gave him a page from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">which she had filled with signatures to the petition there published. She said: “I do not know if God will let me live through Armageddon, but if not, it is all right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A call was put forth for those from foreign countries to come to the platform and make declarations, and everybody laughed when, along with the publishers present from France, Switzerland and other foreign countries, publisher Stark, from New Jersey, came to the platform. Stark has been arrested twenty times, in New Jersey, for preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">National differences are of small moment among Jehovah’s witnesses. An American, a Bohemian, a Frenchman, a German, an Irishman and a Scotchman went out in the work in one ear, and noted their different national relations only because such made absolutely no difference to them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>'‘Known and Read of All Men”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">In Fredericksburg, Va., after a witness had been given in a home, the mistress of the home related some things that had befallen her in her contacts with an unrighteous, double-dealing clergy, and then said, “The idea of Jehovah’s witnesses’ being required to get a permit for preaching the gospel! The clergy should be made to get a permit to do what they are doing, and should pay for it, too.” With that she paused and her big green parrot on the table, which had apparently been listening to every word, said “Ha! ha! ha! ha!” so heartily as to make one think it desired to express its delight with the sentiments uttered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a gasoline station the attendant said he wished he could go with Jehovah’s witnesses, they all looked so happy. The men selling the papers said that they wished they belonged to us. One comical remark made in a large hotel was, “These people belong to every denomination, even including Mohammedanism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one home, where the maid was out in the garden, the head of the house came to the door, and when addressed replied, “Thank the Lord I am a Catholic; let that old Jehovah do what he wishes.” The poor man was so benighted that he did not even know that Jehovah God is the Creator of heaven and earth, and the One in whose hand is the breath of every living creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A newspaper made the significant admission that Jehovah’s witnesses constitute “an army of men and women, their eyes reflecting a deep inner fire and their faces bright with righteousness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On July 18,1933, Mrs. Leila Yuille, pioneer of Duluth, Minn., was in an automobile wreck, sustained a broken leg and had one eye so badly injured that it had to be removed, yet within ten weeks she was back in the pioneer work, has been in it ever since, and was at the convention.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Jonadabs Believe in Immersion?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Do the Jonadabs believe in immersion? One wmuld gather that they do, from the fact that 840 were immersed in the Takoma Park swimming pool. All efforts to look smug were at a discount. Those immersed were entirely satisfied to don bathing suits for the occasion, which was perfectly all right. If anybody did not like the bathing suits it was his privilege to look the other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The weather during the convention was perfect; warm, but not oppressive. The storm on the morning of the first day cleared the air (seemingly all over the earth), and the weather remained ideal throughout.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Music of the Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Washington is past. But there is far more left of it than “only a memory”. The echoes of that convention will reverberate and increase in volume and intensity as well as in significance as the heart dwells upon its theme: the praise of Jehovah. The convention was a song in itself, with varying cadences and measures, but with the one underlying and sustained theme: “Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne [Jehovah, God], and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.” The convention in its entirety, and not merely the more specifically and literally musical part of it, was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">music;</span><span class="font6"> not only music to the ears and hearts of the conventioners, but, we may confidently believe, acceptable praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This brief item is about the singing and the instrumental music of the convention. Heartily do Jehovah’s witnesses sing His praise. While they are not '‘psalm-singing religionists”, they would rather, by far, employ their voices in extolling the glory of Jehovah than in singing meaningless and worthless ditties concocted by those who know not God and who extol men and women rather than the Creator, who is most blessed for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor do God’s people dote on so-called sacred songs of “sentimental sweetness”. To them there is nothing sweeter than the songs of Zion, which have to do with Jehovah’s word and name and with His Son, Christ the King. “Children of the heavenly King must speak their joys abroad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The songs of the convention were vigorous, triumphant, exulting. “Let God arise, and scattered let all his enemies be,” and “Lo 1 the day of God is breaking”, were the themes which resounded with enthusiasm through the convention halls and surrounding parks, where the overflow of the convention could hear all that was going on, by means of amplifying equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The grandest volume of sound was attained at the meeting addressed by Judge Rutherford on Sunday afternoon, on which occasion the vast throng in the Auditorium, and those outside, joined in the inspiring song:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Eternal God, celestial King, Exalted be thy glorious name;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While hosts in heav’n thy praises sing, Let saints on earth thy love proclaim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My heart is fixed on thee, my God;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I rest my hope on thee alone;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I’ll spread thy sacred truths abroad, And to mankind thy love make known. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The deep-toned organ blended with and was all but drowned out by the mighty chorus of jubilant singers. Occasionally a quartet of voices added variety to the program, singing, among other numbers, “Take sides with Jehovah,” and “All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name”. After the meetings the organ played as the happy conventioners collected in groups and their voices blended with the music “as the sound of many waters”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Radio station WOL extended to the convention the courtesy of three half-hour programs by the guest orchestra of WBBR, in attendance at the convention. The Watch Tower male quartet also participated in the programs. An opportunity was thus afforded to invite the public to the Sunday afternoon lecture as well as to call attention to the chain hookup which w’ould carry that lecture to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Monday night, after the close of the convention, at the pioneer camp, the pioneers and others were singing songs of praise to Jehovah far into the night, for the great feast just enjoyed, and for the great privilege of bearing testimony to Jehovah, His King and His kingdom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Jehovah’s Power Made Manifest</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Seven and one-half times around the earth in a second. When? How’? Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness. The declaration of Jehovah’s Government must be made. But how can a small handful of people perform such a mighty task? They cannot in their own strength, but Jehovah can and does provide the ways and means whereby this can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest shout of all time went forth from the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Washington, D.C., when Judge Rutherford delivered his memorable speech on “Government”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were upward of 20,000 people gathered in and around the Washington Auditorium, with millions more in the invisible audience. As the unfaltering declaration rang out in clear-toned eloquence, that the Government of Jehovah is the only hope of the world and that all earthly governments have failed, the vast audience thrilled with the truth of the statements. When the speaker concluded his remarks calling for a rising vote and a shout of “Aye” on the part of all those desiring a government of righteousness, it was like the surging of a tremendous peal of thunder. As this shout went forth from Washington it was instantly taken up by countless numbers in practically every part of the earth, until the whole world was filled with the chorus of “Aye”, from the throats of these people of good will affirming their desire for, and allegiance to, the Government of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For weeks before this never-to-be-forgotten event, hundreds of radio engineers, telephone engineers and other technicians, were employed in assembling the largest combination of wire and wireless communication facilities ever employed at any one time. Long distance telephone lines connected one hundred and eight regular broadcast stations of the United States in a private Watch Tower network. Transoceanic radiotelephone, directional beam and shortwave facilities, public-address systems, and broadcasting stations and telephone networks abroad were utilized to bring within earshot the waiting millions in foreign lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time arrived, the message went out with the speed of light, 186,300 miles per second, seven and one half times round the earth in one second. Jehovah placed at the disposal of His people these appliances whereby it was possible for them to accomplish His purpose. But this was not all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The auditorium was very large, and it required sound amplification to enable those attending to hear. When this sound amplifying equipment was in use, even with low volume, it created an echo which rebounded to the platform and could be heard in the radio microphones, thus destroying the quality of the broadcast. If the volume of the public-address equipment was turned down low enough to prevent an echo from coming back into the radio microphone, it was feared, those in the auditorium could not hear. If enough volume was used to reach the audience inside, the echo was so pronounced that it ruined the radio pickup. The radio engineers and those in charge of the public address equipment worked day and night trying </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font6"> setup, trying </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font6"> setup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Saturday afternoon the entire network of long distance telephone lines that was to connect the radio stations was set up for final test. The afternoon program was picked up by the telephone engineers and sent to various points throughout the country, as a test sample of what was to come the following day. The reports came back from one and all: “Not fit for broadcast”: the echo ruined the radio pickup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Engineers were discouraged. Their statement was that they had never been able to make a decent pickup from this particular auditorium. Further experiments were conducted until about one hour before the big broadcast. Men had done all they could, but the echo was not cleared up. However, this was Jehovah’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time for the broadcast arrived; the entire earth was linked in this mighty network; the spirit of the Lord rested upon one of His obedient servants, Judge Rutherford; the message went forth in clarion tones, crystal clear. Something had happened! The faces of the telephone engineers, the radio engineers, the public-address sound equipment engineers, grew brighter: the echo had gone; but howl They did not know. This was the message of Jehovah. Then the reports came in: “Clear as a bell”; “Never had better reception”; “Finest reception we have had across the Atlantic.” Local reports, long distance reports, overseas reports from “the ends of the earth”. Reception perfect; praise to Jehovah!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Report of a Technician</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The attendance of thousands of people at one auditorium on such an occasion as this produces a problem of considerable importance to sound engineers. The Washington Auditorium is of such dimensions and so proportioned that it would be utterly impossible for all of the thousands of people in attendance to hear the speakers without the aid of mechanical and electrical devices of various kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this convention it is interesting to note that practically all of the electrical amplification of the sound, both inside and outside of the Auditorium, was manufactured, installed and operated by the Society. The system of amplification was so designed that any one of three condenser microphones, and either 78 rpm or 33 J rpm records, could be used, any one alone, or in combination at any time. That is, four separate channels were provided for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the sound was ‘picked up’ by the microphones and passed through a two-stage, high-gain pre-amplifier, it was passed on to seven power amplifiers, so arranged that any one of them could be independently controlled. The total amplification for the entire installation had a power output of 150 watts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of these seven power amplifiers was required to feed four trumpets and six trumpet units in the main auditorium. Another was required to feed five trumpets and six trumpet units in the basement auditorium. Another was required to feed the trumpet in the Assembly Hall and Hard-of-Hearing Room, and the remaining four were required to carry the sound to the multitudes on the outside of the Auditorium, in two adjacent parks. These amplifiers for the outside multitude were mounted upon sound cars and were supplied with power from the car’s power plant. These cars were equipped with the Society’s Sound Equipment No. 2, each car having its own crew of operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lecture on “Government”, given on Sunday afternoon by Judge Rutherford, was the ‘high spot’ of the entire convention. The sound amplification and the radio ‘pickup’ for that lecture had to be the best possible. Unfortunately, the Washington Auditorium does not seem to be well suited for both sound amplification for the audience inside the Auditorium and for a radio ‘pickup’ simultaneously. Either one or the other must suffer. Inasmuch as it was deemed of most importance for the radio audience to receive the lecture well, it was therefore necessary to reduce the amplification inside the main auditorium to a considerably lower level than what was used at the other sessions of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason for this is that sound amplification inside the auditorium creates an echo plus much reverberation, all of which seem to be focused on a point at about the same place where the radio ‘pickup’ microphones are located for the speaker on the stage. This, of course, would be very objectionable to the thousands listening in on the air. Hence the sound amplification for this particular broadcast was operated at as low a level as possible, so as to reduce the reverberation (but &quot;the talk was heard fine everywhere in the auditorium, even in the back row of the gallery).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One incident in connection with the four sound ears located in the two parks adjacent to the Auditorium is of considerable interest. Permits for locating these cars were obtained from the park commissioners some days before the convention began, and in order to locate the cars it was necessary to drive them over the curb and across the sidewalks and upon the smooth green lawn of the park. Policemen were stationed about the Auditorium, and when they saw the sound cars driving thus boldly upon the grass their eyes fairly bulged at such audacity. However, the green grass, the trees, the beautiful parks, and all the earth, belong to the Lord; and the sooner all the people realize this, the better for them. One of the policemen was heard to say, “In all my years of service this is the first time I have ever seen an automobile drive over a city park.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Auditorium has a fine pipe organ, of which Jehovah’s people made constant use. On the top of the high arch over the rostrum was a rich banner or sign reading, “For Jehovah and for Gideon.” Other elegant signs, indicating different departments or activities of Jehovah’s witnesses were in and about the Auditorium, and elsewhere in Washington and vicinity, wherever such activities were located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound equipment served an excellent purpose in keeping everybody posted on what was going on. Over and above the sea of thousands of voices between the convention sessions comes a stentorian voice, “Attention! Attention, please!” Three times this is repeated, and then as the voices are hushed the announcement is given. Everybody in every part of the Auditorium (and in the adjacent parks, for that matter) could hear every word of every announcement.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Post Office and Bulletin Board</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The post office in the Auditorium was the center of milling throngs. Thousands of letters were delivered. There were seven cartons a day of outgoing mail. In one day six thousand 1c stamps and four thousand 3c stamps were sold. The bulletin boards looked like grandma’s patchwork quilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did you ever try to find a friend at a convention where 20,000 delegates were in attendance ? The bulletin board was largely used for that purpose at the Washington convention. When the delegates left for home there were yet 437 bulletin notes that fell into the hands of “the Philistines”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only half of these were from delegates who were looking for others. Usually they told whom they wished to see and where they wished to see them, and the time. Others were desirous to meet anybody from their home company. One bulletin unaddressed and unsigned said, “Don’t know where to meet you, as you didn’t state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Curiously, the majority wished to meet their friends “at the bulletin board”, perhaps the worst place they could have thought of, as it was the most crowded part of the lobby. Another favorite “meeting place” was “at the post office”, almost as bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five bulletins were in foreign tongues. Their secrets are quite safe, as they are now in the waste basket. Two of the bulletins were cartoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were numerous transportation items of Jehovah’s people headed for Ontario, California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, Maryland, Florida, Wyoming, Indiana, Delaware, Maine, New Brunswick, Michigan, New York, Minnesota, Ohio and Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lost: Brown jacket; blue sapphire belonging to a ring; man’s hat, size 7; pioneer envelope; brown leather bag; 40c worth of meal tickets; a package of post cards; glasses with a dark rim, double lens; a bunch of keys; car keys; a gray fedora hat; a hatbox; a ladies’ blue silk hat; a white purse; a heavy black comb; and a pencil sharpener.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Others found and posted notices offering to restore a bathing cap; a small key evidently belonging to a grip; a small leather identification case; a man’s black umbrella; a brilliant pin in the shape of a bow; a brown leather witnessing bag; a package of post cards; a black coat belt; one dollar’s worth of meal tickets; a pioneer card; a man’s brown felt hat; a woman’s black umbrella; ladies’ handkerchief, with earrings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One bulletin said, “Come back to see us. We can never find you in this crowd.” Another one said, “Am here and was looking for you, but I guess you are not here yet. I don’t know where to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few told how they could be identified. One lady would have a card in her hat, another would have on a tan hat and dress. One wanted to meet the “sister of Kaiser Wilhelm now pioneering in the United States”. (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The really important bulletins were engagements to go out in the service together, offers to share territory, requests for pioneer partners, trailers for sale, offers to purchase a car suitable for pulling a trailer, offers of meal tickets, offers to take pioneers in, requests to get in touch with pioneers, an appeal from blind pioneers for somebody to drive their car and trailer to Dayton, Ohio, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a portable</span><span class="font6"> transcription machine for sale, two letters in their envelopes but without postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An interesting bulletin was the following: “Dear John: We came in Thursday, and by then the territory was so scarce we had to go 70 miles one way to start of territory. We put in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">long day Friday and expect to put in a longer one on Saturday. Don't believe we will go out Sunday, as we want to go home Sunday p.m. and our bunch couldn’t stand the long trip in service extra on Sunday. I will see you early Sunday morning if you will be around then where the chairs are on lawn opposite Auditorium, say about 8:30 a.m. Maybe we can get a little territory with some other brethren near Washington. I will find out. Love, Clem.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Interviews with Judge Rutherford</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Executives at the convention were courteous and accessible, but busy. Temptations to stop and chat with friends one has known and loved for years were many. Interviews were arranged, not for those that needed to have a tooth out, but for those concerned with the Kingdom interests, with Judge Rutherford. He has something else to do than talk aimlessly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The object of a convention is not merely to bring friends together for a good time. Jehovah’s witnesses assemble to serve Jehovah and to sing and proclaim His praise. But in so doing the meeting of those of like precious faith, and the exchange of thought and recounting of experiences in the service of the truth, is very happifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those whose love and devotion are set upon Jehovah do of necessity love one another; consequently they delight in the fellowship of kindred minds as well as in their fellowship of service. Hence the meeting of friends and the discussion of the talks and other subjects relating to Jehovah’s commandments and His service formed a delightful adjunct of convention activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who Tiavethe testimony of Jesus Christ and keep God’s commandments’ have much to talk of. A convention is an appropriate occasion for carrying out of the prophetic picture: “Thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” —Psalm 145:10-12.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Washington in Gala Attire but in the Dumps</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah’s witnesses were in Washington, the most beautiful city in the world was like Babylon in the days of Belshazzar. It was in gala attire, but it was in the dumps. At an expense of tens of thousands of dollars it was being decorated for the conclave of the Shriners. The decorations were of Egyptian (that is, heathen) design. The Society of American Magicians opened at Wardman Park, Washington, Thursday, May 30, the first days of Jehovah’s witnesses’ convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Appropriately Watchtower, headquarters of the new government, is right among the embassies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the convention was in session the Supreme Court moved from the little chamber which it has always occupied to its palace on Constitution avenue. Work on the exterior decorations of the palace is still going on. One of the decorations was a figure of Justice, in two parts. There were several of these sets. In one instance the head was missing, probably on account of what happened in Alexandria!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington’s usual Decoration Day parade was called off because of rain; also the rites for peace-time heroes who went to death in line of duty, such as policemen and firemen, and employees on the Titanic. Special vaccination exercises for Jehovah’s witnesses were held in Alexandria Sunday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There will be no more conventions in the Washington Auditorium for some time. The Government took it over at the expiration of the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thing that made official Washington blue, besides having Jehovah’s witnesses in their midst, was that the Supreme Court had put the skids under the NRA. The president of the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, the chairman of the Du Pont de Nemours Company, the chairman of the board of the Bethlehem Steel Company, and Reverend Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, all thought the NRA was just the thing; and why would they not ? It brought all the biggest companies out of the red, even though it helped the common man hardly at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But Virgil Jordan, president of the National Industrial Conference Board said of the NRA, ‘■'What has occurred in the United States during the last year is perhaps the greatest catastrophe in the history of civilization, and certainly the most profound that has happened to us in America.” Wm. R. Castle, Jr., former undersecretary of state, said similarly: 'Tn eleven months it [personal liberty] has almost ceased to exist.” Representative James M. Beck, of Pennsylvania, said: '‘Today the vital spirit of the American Constitution has been snuffed out.” Senator David A. Reed, of Pennsylvania, said: “America is being fed poisons from which it will take decades to recover.” Ogden L. Mills, former secretary of the treasury, said: “We shall never solve the paradox of want in the midst of plenty simply by doing away with the plenty.” So those whose hopes were in the so-called “New Deal” were all upset, by contrast with the joy that filled the hearts of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Splendid Hospital Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Up all day and much of the night, and in the most interesting, exciting and thrilling work in the world, Jehovah’s witnesses, like other people, sometimes need repairs. Sixteen doctors, of all different schools, and nine different nurses gave treatments to the number of 1,548 during the convention period. This does not include calls made at hotels and homes, and there were many such calls, at all hours of the day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The co-operative service rendered by the staff of nurses and doctors was as nearly perfect as it would be possible for imperfect creatures to render. There was no friction. The hospital service was wholly free. However, many desired to pay their way, with the result that an amount sufficient to pay all expenses incident to hospital maintenance was contributed and a nice balance left over.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Superb Cafeteria Arrangements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">At a previous convention the president of the Watch Tower Society advised Jehovah’s witnesses to eat the right food and keep themselves fit physically so that they might perform the Kingdom publishing work more efficiently. The applause that greeted that wholesome advice showed that Jehovah’s witnesses keenly appreciated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Proper food well prepared is especially necessary at conventions; for these assemblies burn up a lot of energy in the journey to them, the wide-flung field service, the days of excitement in the moving crowds, the meeting of old acquaintances, and the general cramming of intense activity into a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To provide this food, fresh, quickly and conveniently to hungry thousands in between the lecture meetings, is a problem in timing, cooking, food transportation, crowd handling and serving that no amateurs should attempt. Naturally, the cafeteria arrangements were placed in the hands of our Greek brethren, who were given a free hand to display their national genius for food catering. The dining-room staff numbered about 150, and included pioneers. Most of them were on the job fourteen hours a day, smiling and efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cafeteria was located in the cool basement hall of the convention auditorium. Convenient high tables accommodated lines of lunch-ers, while others formed small groups and arranged their chairs in circles, with their luncheon trays on their knees. About half a dozen queues were arranged to pass by the food counters; one simply picked up a tray, followed the line, and “shopped as you went”, paying with strip-tickets purchased previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pleasing item of the cafeteria service was the large supply of red drinking cups and bowls made of “beetleware”, a plastic composition invented in England. Each one was stamped w’ith a gold seal “For Jehovah and for Gideon”, and it seemed appropriate that the priests of the Most High should have this expression of “holiness to the Lord” even on their drinking vessels. (The tummy-plating aluminum pots and cups of Mr. Mellon were wisely omitted.) At the close of the convention the beetleware cups and dishes were distributed as souvenirs, at ten cents each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A word about the good food. The usual convention diet of white bread and coffee, a hangover from “Chautauqua” days, coupled with excitement, noise and heat, is responsible for “convention colly-wobbles” which have laid many low in times past. But here was a pleasing variety of inexpensive food. For breakfast, fruit, cereals, boiled eggs, whole-wheat sandwiches, whole-wheat doughnuts, and five beverages, including buttermilk and fruit punch. For luncheon and dinner, soups, eggs, ham, hamburgers, beef stew, baked beans, sandwiches, various salads, fruit desert, custard, pies, cake, ice cream and beverages. Not that anyone would manage to stow away that list, but there were about fifty varieties of foodstuffs to select from during the five days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you wish to know how many tons of foodstuffs were consumed at the cafeteria, weigh three square meals in a pair of round scales and multiply it by the average for five days of attendance ranging between 10,000 and 20,000. The answer is the sum total of good eating for Jehovah’s fighting unit as gathered at Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A loud-speaker system connected with the platform of the auditorium broadcast notices and information from time to time during the mealtimes. After meals many remained in their seats in the cool basement-hall and listened to the convention programs over this sound system, which functioned perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Washington (D.C.) policeman seemed to be on duty near a side exit of the cafeteria, or perhaps he just wandered in to enjoy the spectacle of thousands of people happily talking together; at any rate, he was obviously enjoying himself, chatting with the friends and munching the lunches brought to him by the cafeteria servers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An assignment to a worldly convention is no cinch for a policeman, and many dread it. After one Midwest convention of a political-brotherhood association, 50,000 gin and whisky bottles were cleared up. How many brawls came out of the bottles, we do not know<sup>7</sup>, but no doubt the police had their hands full to control the riots. At such conventions they overlook the general drunkenness, property destruction, soliciting of harpies and general “whoopee” that go on at these mad bedlams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the few policemen assigned to direct traffic or for emergencies at the Washington convention auditorium were having the time of their lives. They were astonished at the unfailing good humor of everyone, the courtesy and patience, the joyous spirit everywhere, the absolute absence of tobacco-stinkers and “rummies”. They were asking questions and getting a cascade of Jehovah’s truth poured over them by bubbling witnesses for His truth. Our policeman friend in the cafeteria stuffed a couple of booklets into his tunic and relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cafeteria arrangements were good, the food excellent; the servers were our own smiling brethren. One could not but think of the time when, under the Master’s direction, the crowd sat down in an orderly manner and they were fed; and the text printed on the menu card of the Washington convention of Jehovah’s witnesses well expresses our gratitude for the arrangement made by the Society for their welfare: “Give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of Washington’s high-class business men were present in the cafeteria much of the time; they highly praised its management: they said they had never seen anything of the kind carried on so nicely, so systematically and in such a cleanly manner. They were especially impressed with the happy co-operation manifest. The secretary of the American Pie Bakeries said he had traveled much, and had attended many large gatherings at which people were fed, but had never been to one better organized or where better foods were served by such happy, patient and willing workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is a statement of the food purchased for the cafeteria:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rolls, 3,996; bread, 6,547 pounds; baked ham, 1,013 pounds; beef, 2,186 pounds; chickens, 310 pounds; cheese, 615 pounds; eggs, 930 dozen; coffee, 700 pounds; milk, 29,800 half pints; buttermilk, 3,620 half pints; milk (bulk), 240 gallons; cream (20 percent), 120 gallons; butter, 511 pounds; pies, 2,619 (10-inch) ; doughnuts, 622 dozen; pastry’, 620 dozen; peanut butter, 200 pounds; grape juice, 100 gallons; sugar (granulated), 2,100 pounds; sugar (tablets), 660 pounds; beans, 234 gallon cans; tomatoes, 36 gallon cans; peas, 42 gallon cans; jelly, 12 half-gallon cans; vegetable oil, 93 gallons; cereals (individual), 54 cartons; celery, 11 crates; radishes, 200 bunches; bananas, 63 bunches; tomatoes, 31 crates; cucumbers, 35 baskets; lettuce, 33 crates; carrots, 35 crates; cabbage, 2,000 pounds; oranges, 48 crates; apples, 125 boxes and baskets; wax tissue, 85 reams. Ice cream: Cups, 315 dozen; popsickles, 41 dozen; sandwich ice cream, 423 dozen; choc kow, 395 dozen; individual bricks, 75 gallons. Fruit punch, 1,280 gallons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the fact that the restaurateurs who managed the cafeteria at Washington Auditorium were top-notchers in the business, well known as such throughout America, some might wonder how it comes that a writer in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font6"> magazine, of June 10, could say of the basement, “It was rank with mixed smells.” It should be explained that this rank smell was evident only for a few minutes, and only in the person that wrote the dirty crack just mentioned. As soon as he had gone out, the place was sweet and clean again; and the farther and faster he went, the sweeter the air became, and the sooner. A tobacco-stinking, rum-soaked garlic eater afflicted with a bad case of halitosis and sour feet is conscious of his vile state only when he comes in contact with cleanliness and purity. The writer for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font6"> would be helped by a bath and change of underwear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cleanest People Ever in Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Said H. J. Cressman, fireman of engine No. 5, Washington (D. C.) fire department: “You are the most wonderful people I ever saw. If anybody had told me that this place could have been kept as clean as it is, for the number of people there are here, I would have called him crazy. Usually, this place, when there is a convention here, is so full of smoke you could cut it with a knife. I see no filth; there is no evidence of fire here at all.” This man asked many questions concerning the work and was thankful to get one of the booklets. He also said that the entire fire department of his section listened to Judge Rutherford's address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To keep the basement sweet and clean it was thoroughly cleansed twice a day, and twice a day trucks came and carried away all the empty ice cream sandwich containers, and other wrappings inevitably associated with the cafeteria feeding of twenty thousand people in a few minutes’ time. Meals were served to some workers as late as 2:00 a. m. When the place was closed, late at night, it was always as neat as a pin. The management and conduct of the place was something with which every person connected therewith could be justly proud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bethel Special</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For days before the convention pioneers and others from every part of the United States and Canada passed through New York en route to the convention, and took advantage of the opportunity to see the Brooklyn Bethel home of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its factory en route, the most wonderful home in the world, and the bookmaking establishment that is acknowledged to be the best-managed publishing house on earth. The “Bethelites” did not need this visitation by conventioners to get them interested in the convention, but it did not lessen the interest any. They worked extra hours to make up the time they would be away, and were glad to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Supper Thursday night was “like a cross between a ‘ladies’ aid society’ and a beehive”. So says a lady reporter; and she ought to know. How should a man know anything about that? Right after supper they began to leave (those that had cars), and some left at all hours of the night. The remainder of the family were too excited to sleep, and were up early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah had revealed to His people that their conventions since 1922 were events in fulfillment of divine prophecy, and therefore it was only reasonable to expect that also this convention would be of import, even a climax. They knew that it was just seven years since the war cry of the remnant “For Jehovah and for Gideon” started, and that something must be indicated that this cry was much to the fore in the preparations for Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pleasant surprise was the careful arrangements the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had made for the soldiers about to entrain. At the terminal in New York, at the proper gate, was a signboard with the inscription “Bethel Special for Jehovah’s witnesses”. The train consisted of six coaches: four marked “New York Delegates”, and two, “New Jersey and Pennsylvania Delegates.” Many boarded the special at the different stops, Newark, New Brunswick, Trenton, Philadelphia, and Wilmington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah provided the “Bethelites” with the first electric train ever used by them as a convention special. There was no dust, smoke nor soot, and not one stinking tobacco user on the train. Little baggage was taken along; none of it cluttering the aisles or seats. The 235 miles were made in 414 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On arrival at Washington each witness boarded a car which was for him and his party during the convention. In this car, the number of which was known in advance, the witness was whisked to his lodgings, and thence to the convention headquarters. After a bounteous dinner, and the securing of ammunition for the next day’s field service, “Bethelites,” and all others, had the privilege of hearing Judge Rutherford give a wonderful talk on “The Great Multitude”, showing that the Jonadabs are the “great multitude” ‘which stand before the throne with palms in their hands’.—Revelation 7: 9-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the way back to Bethel, Sunday night, it was agreed that it was the best convention yet. Many were the anticipations as to what would be its results. Would it be found later that another prophecy had been fulfilled? One could but wait to see. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses will anxiously await the forthcoming issues of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> confidently expecting something unusual and thrilling in its columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Automobile to Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were over 1,500 automobiles at the convention, showing that well over a third of the delegates came by that means, say some 7,500 people. All came through safely, though some had narrow escapes. One car was nearly run down by a drunken driver coming from the opposite direction. Apparently a small stone was dislodged from the hill at the side of the driveway, just in time to avert a tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two witnesses started from northern Canada ; their car broke down; they could not afford the cost of necessary repairs. They hitchhiked their way to the convention, and arrived in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Ostermyers had an accident with their car on the way. Ostermyer fell asleep at the wheel and ran off the road. The car ran through a guardrail, hung for an instant by two wires, and then righted itself and landed on four wheels again, as if something had said “No”. Onlookers marveled. Occupants of the car were bumped around some, but were able to continue on their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington, like Indianapolis, is very easy to get around in when one knows the city, but is confusing to strangers. A Massachusetts reporter for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> describing efforts of his party to find the Washington headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, said humorously:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first thing we knew was that we had run plumb into a traffic circle. After going around it enough times to get good and dizzy we concluded that we had struck Massachusetts avenue, and started looking for headquarters, but the more we looked, the less we found; so back to the circle we went again. ‘ ‘ Here it is,” said one; but, turning down the street, we found that we had contacted a mixture of alphabet and numerals that would not give us what we were looking for, no matter how hard we tried. It sure reminded me of the Devil’s crowd. They think they have something, and start down a road, but the farther they travel, the more of a mess they get into.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We got to the hall at last and got a nice handy territory in Baltimore, with an assignment of rooms twenty miles out. Up at six the next morning we started for our territory eager for the battle, only to find at the end of an hour that we had covered our territory, and headed 40 miles back to Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">N. A. Yuille, of San Francisco, came by auto via Tallahassee, Fla., making the trip to Tallahassee in 5% days. He considered the low grades, good roads and freedom from dust storms justified the longer trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A thoughtful New York reporter for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> said: “Everyone seems to have made the last possible sacrifice to be here. Pioneers are very thankful for book allowance that made it possible for them to come.” Jehovah’s witnesses are mainly from the middle walks of life, as one may judge from the more than 1,500 good-looking automobiles in the service at Washington, but some are the Lord’s poor. All are one in the Lord. Taxi-drivers remarked that they did not seem selfish, like other charges, but tried to help one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the treats of the convention was to see a California witness, who lives in a palace, and came in a brand-new car, and stopped at one of the best hotels, hobnobbing with Sumako Ogawachi, Japanese, of New York, who had no other way to get to the convention than to make the 470-mile round trip afoot. Either one would be willing to go to the stake for the privilege of having some share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two letters that Mrs. Ogawachi wrote to headquarters while on her way to Washington will be enjoyed, and all the more because no errors are corrected. Maybe you could write Japanese better than Sumako writes English, but if not, she would probably smile in a benevolent way at your well-meant attempts. She says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Brothren: As on my way to Washington by walking with 50 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity</span><span class="font5"> and 700 radio folders are distributed as I meet people, but not as house to house. Thus I met police officers in the New Jersey state, from Jersey City to Elizabeth meny, untill today. they have accept them most of them, only Cheef of police, in Elizabeth said “Oh, Judge Rutherford’s! I have something in my minde, so I wont take it” But they did not hold my sholder to rock me up. Faith in the Lord Sr. Ogawachi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Brethren: Greeting:— in the glorious day of Lord’s almighty, yesterday (Sunday) of my visitation to the Jehovah’s witnesses of Philadelphia Co. was a thrill and blessing. Their bright and shining faces of class were heartily wellcomed a little stranger as under name of Jehovah’s witness. As it is unnes-secerly to explain to you how about a Brotherly love in this circuration for there is already composed unbreakable oneness by love of the Lord. Therefor I am in perfect protection in His service. Concerning, my report of sendees around Philadelphia will be done through this Company while I am here and I may leave here tomorrow. How I am glad to see you at convention of Washington. With much love in His name Sr. Suma Ogawachi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One more transportation item. Pioneer Mears, of Portland, Oreg., is 60, of wiry build, suntanned, loves God, and wanted to attend the convention. When she took stock of her resources she found she had $3.11. She hitchhiked her way to the convention in two weeks, worked for her meals, and slept in barns along the route. Sometimes the farmers gave her blankets; sometimes not. One day she walked into the headquarters at 1603 Massachusetts avenue and related her story as if it were nothing in the world. Kind hearts soon made her welcome and provided for all her needs. One day, when lifts were scarce, she walked 29 miles. At Chicago she spent 3c for postage to send word that she was on the way. When she arrived she had $3.01. There is a difference here of 7c which has not been explained. What she did with those 7c during the two weeks she was en route is a matter for later examination. All together, she walked about 150 miles of the entire distance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>The Washington Police</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Washington police are above the average. Most of them seem to be Americans, which is unusual, especially since the Roman Catholic hierarchy started out to grab America. Of course, there are members on the force in every large city who are eager to do the will of the pope and his underlings; but they are not conspicuous in Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At first some of the cops were apprehensive of trouble, having been made so by misinformation carefully passed out in advance. On the second day of the convention one lady was informed by an officer of the law that Jehovah’s witnesses are communists and seditionists and would have trouble before they left the city. His ancestors were probably born in Cork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Ballantynes were accosted by a plainclothes man who said it was against the law to carry a sign on the back of a car used for touring purposes, but when assured there were thousands in the city so doing, and that he would better go to the Auditorium and see the convention management, he concluded to let the matter rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It did not take long before all the cops in Washington were friends of Jehovah’s witnesses. At the convention hall the police soon found they had nothing to do. There were no tobacco users, no drunks, no abusive language, no quarrels, no disorder; there were smiles on every face, and before long the cops smiled back. One became much interested, and went out in the work as a Jonadab, in his uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a long-haired fanatical religionist came around and tried to do what he could to start some trouble the cop on duty reminded him that this was a Jw convention and if he had any sense he would go home and attend to his own business. The officers had nothing to do but listen to the addresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they came in to make inspections they stated that Jehovah’s witnesses are the cleanest crowd they have ever seen, and the most orderly. It only proves that the voluntary obedience to the law of God is so vastly superior to the enforced obedience to the law of man that there is no comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the infamies at Alexandria occurred, one officer at the Auditorium said that it was a shame the way Jehovah’s witnesses had been treated under the Roman Catholic chief there in power, and that if he were the management he would take the whole 20,000 conventioners over to Alexandria, put one at every house in town and talk the situation to a standstill. That could have been done; but the Lord will have a better way. Just watch!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>“Barbara Fritchie’s Work Is O’er”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the Frederick (Md.) officials became confused while the convention was on, and jailed some of Jehovah’s witnesses; but these were all kindly treated, and when the matter came up for examination they were dismissed. Two of the boys arrested at Frederick were John Wargo (20 years of age) and James Antonio (19 years of age). Their stories follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John has been in the truth since he was 13 years of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">age, and</span><span class="font6"> has been a pioneer for the past five years. You could not know him without loving him. The first time he was arrested was at Swoyersville, Pa.; the second time, at Bethlehem, Pa.; the third time, at Pittston, Pa. (at which time his own mother was also jailed, along with 21 others); the fourth and fifth times, at Duryea, Pa.; and he has also been taken in and questioned at Scranton, Pa., Taylor, Pa., Plymouth, Pa., and Forty Fort, Pa. Describing some of his Frederick (Md.) experiences John said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The officer stood at the comer. I made an effort to go to the bank, and he stopped me there and wanted to talk to me. I told him I was too busy to talk to him. I went into the bank, and when I came out he was at the doorstep waiting for me. When he came to me he said, ‘I have got to talk to you: I want to know who you are. Are you a Jw?’ I answered him that I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He asked me if they were the same thing, and I told him that they were. Then he asked me if I knew of any arrests yesterday. I replied that it does not bother me whether anybody is arrested or not: my job is to preach Jehovah God’s kingdom. This I am supposed to do regardless of any hindrances, because it is the commandment of Jehovah God. He asked me then whether I had any respect for the laws of the land. I answered him that I have not violated any laws whatever, but if any laws are enacted to prohibit the preaching of Jehovah God’s kingdom, which is the highest law, it will be broken, because Jehovah’s law is the highest of them all. Then he asked me whether I have any respect for the country. I answered him that I had nothing against it, so, naturally, I had respect for it. Then he asked me why do we go out mainly on Sundays and legal holidays doing this work. I answered him that, like others, we have to work for a living, but when those duties have been fulfilled we go out in the Lord’s work regardless of whether it is Sunday or a holiday. On such days we usually have the time to go out; therefore we go out mainly on Sundays and legal holidays. Then he asked me, ‘Who is Jehovah?’ Then I gave him the testimony card. He read it aloud. Then I took out the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> and told him that if I would stay there a week, talking day and night, I could not present the matter as well as it is presented in this book: this book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font5"> gives the explanation of this in full. With the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Universal</span><span class="font5"> lV«r </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Near</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Favored, People,</span><span class="font5"> we are specializing on the three on a contribution of 35c. Then he made a statement: ‘Instead of me arresting you, you are compelling me to buy books.’ In answer to that I told him, ‘We do not sell books, but this is our method of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, and if you think we are profiteering, I suggest you try it, yourself, and see how much profit you make on the books.’ With that he put his hand in his pocket and took out 35 cents and said, ‘Instead of me arresting you, you have sold me the books, and I will take them and read them.’ And he also promised me that he would be here at the lecture to hear Judge Rutherford personally.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">James Antonio has not been quite as efficient in breaking his way into jail as John Wargo; still he is a year younger than John, and is coming along. So far James has been arrested in Fitchburg, Mass., Leominster, Mass., Winchendon, Mass., and Frederick, Md.; only four times; still, this is not a bad record for a lad of only 19 years. James said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The people of Frederick became interested, when we returned there after being arrested there two times. The people there are asking about our arrest. They seemed to be against the idea of locking us up. I met a policeman who was in the court when we had our trial. I witnessed to him today. He was interested. I placed a set with him. We went over our territory three times. The first time we placed 54 booklets and 4 bound books. The second time we were arrested. The third time we placed 22 booklets and 6 bound books in one hour. I met the newspaper reporter who gave us the write-up. He said he admired our way of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. He said he wished we would come over and help him lead the Sunday school; also wished his people would go around and do this work, the same as we do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s people at Washington were delighted when their Father so arranged it that John Sabonjian, Wilhelmina Henze, and Anna Dziatkiewicz, who were in prison when the convention opened, were released in time to attend the sessions on Sunday and Monday. They thus had the privilege of hearing Judge Rutherford deliver in person his great address on “Government”, and his impromptu speech of Monday that so delighted all the conventioners that heard it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>The Disgrace of Alexandria</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It is to the everlasting disgrace of Alexandria that it has its present chief of police, who is apparently a mere tool of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. For reasons best known to the Devil he decided to make his stand against the truth, not in Washington, where the conventioners were treated with utmost kindness and consideration, but in “Old Dominion”, and in the city where they were most recently abused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Sunday afternoon, June 2,1935, M. J. Tele-viak, of Chicago, Ill., was operating one of the forty sound cars that broadcast the lecture of Judge Rutherford, and was the only one of the forty molested. This in itself shows that it was the spirit of the Devil that caused the molestation. Televiak was on private property, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">iy<sub>2 </sub></span><span class="font6">miles out of Alexandria. Permission, in writing, had been obtained to use the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Music was first played, and Judge Rutherford had been speaking about fifteen minutes, when two of the Alexandria police force came and ordered the lecture cut off. They admitted that there was no complaint and no law; it was merely the will of the Roman hierarchy against an American’s preaching the gospel in the manner of his choice. Televiak was arrested because he refused to relinquish his rights, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">held </span><span class="font6">under $25 bail, charged with disorderly conduct. In every city of the land the Roman outfit clangs bells at unseemly hours; that is considered all right. Televiak refused to advance any money, and was locked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the night he heard officers say that Jehovah’s witnesses are propagandists (a term which the Roman hierarchy actually applies to itself), communists, and ought to be run out of the country (so that Rome could have it to do with it as she would). One said that if one of Jehovah’s witnesses came to his door it would be the last one he would call at: he would flatten his nose out even with his lips if he should call. What manner of officer of the law is it that talks in this manner? Would he do these things as a law-abiding citizen, or in contravention of the law he is sworn to uphold? The man is an anarchist, unfit for any post of trust whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Televiak was put in a cell black with tobacco juice spit all over the walls, and inhabited by bedbugs and cockroaches. For a bed there was a frame with iron slats, and nothing on the slats. Four men were jammed in the one cell. The aroma was terrific; the cell, absolutely putrid. “I was vaccinated against my will,” Televiak said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses familiar with mistreatment of decent men and women in New Jersey were shocked at the conditions in the Alexandria jail. Some of the toilet bowls in the cells were broken and the urine ran out on the floor where the prisoners were standing. At the trial the judge and police remained seated while the prisoners,male and female, black and white, were compelled to stand in their “august” presence.</span></p>

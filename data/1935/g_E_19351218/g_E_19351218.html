<p><span class="font11">Satan the Devil is the opposite of all that Jehovah God and Jesus Christ His Son stand for and represent.<sup><a href="#bookmark35">1</a></sup> He it is that is “that crooked serpent” (Isaiah 27:1); he it is that sowed the tares among the wheat. (Matthew 13:25,39) He it is that is the father of lies. (John 8:44) A murderer. (John 8:44) The ruler of the darkness of this world. (Ephesians 6:12) The spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience. (Ephesians 2:2) And he it is that offered Jesus all the governments of the world, and the glory of them, including their flags, if Jesus would fall down and worship him.—Matthew 4:8,9.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The People of Jehovah</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The people of Jehovah know that Satan will perish. Not only will Jesus “destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil” (Hebrews 2:14), but the Devil’s works also, including the governments he offered to Jesus, will be destroyed. “For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”—1 John 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The reason why the people of Jehovah have ranged themselves on the side of Jehovah and have thus exposed themselves to all the fiery darts of the wicked (Ephesians 6:16) is that Jehovah’s side is the side of righteousness and truth, of love and justice, of nobility and generosity toward all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The people of the Devil have ranged themselves on the side of the Devil, partly because they have been deceived by him into thinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">that he is the true God, and partly because in their fallen condition they love strife and murder, force and hypocrisy, forms and ceremonies and entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No doubt, when Cain killed Abel, Satan and Gog and the nephilim (rebel angels) approved the murder and thought that Cain did just right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the earth was filled with violence in the days of Noah, these evil ones were glad to do all they could to help it along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That they tried to destroy Isaac, the typical seed of promise, is certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That they sought the death of righteous Lot is also certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Esau set out to kill Jacob, the Devil and the evil angels no doubt goaded him on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Would anybody now say that it was other than the Devil and his associates, visible and invisible, that dragged Joseph away from his aged father and cast him into a dungeon in the land of Egypt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Who is there that would now presume to justify the devilish persecutions of the Jews in Egypt, the Pharaohs even seeking the death of the babes as soon as they were born ? The most that can be said for Pharaoh is that the newborn infants were put to death mercifully. Apparently they were not tortured in the manner set forth in the running subheads beneath the title of this article.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Fires of Moloch</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">In the land of Canaan, prior to the days of Joshua, patriotic Canaanites burned their babies to death in the brazen arms of the god Moloch, and that all seemed quite right to the Devil and the Devil’s associates in the invisible realm and in Canaan itself. But this torture of the children to death (see again the subhead of this article) was very displeasing to Jehovah God. “And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am [Jehovah].” (Leviticus 18:21) Incidentally, if anybody wishes to know the real reason why all the nations were destroyed out of the land of Canaan, read the entire eighteenth chapter of Leviticus and see the things of which these children of the Devil were guilty, besides torturing their school children at the behest of the clergy of that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The whole book of Esther shows how the Devil, acting through a suitable Judas by the name of Haman, undertook the destruction of the entire Jewish people—another attempt to destroy the line from which Jesus was born according to the flesh. Similar attempts at destroying the line were made as recorded in the book of Ruth and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The book of Job, from end to end, sets forth the Devil's methods of seeking to destroy the people of Jehovah, and their children, but at that time the Devil had not been able to think of anything as mean as was recently done at Canonsburg, Pa. Read once again the headlines at the beginning of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider how the Devil sawed Isaiah asunder for telling the truth and worked upon his royal highness Zedekiah to sink Jeremiah in muck in a wellhole because he dared to proclaim the name and the message of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>In the Days of Daniel</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">What a record the book of Daniel provides of the attempts of the Devil and the Devil’s politicians and clergy to destroy Daniel and his three companions, who had purposed that they would not defile themselves by eating of the lung’s meat, previously offered to idols. Since an idol is nothing in the world, some would say this was overconscientiousness on the part of these four men. But not so, for the name of Jehovah God was involved, and Daniel and his friends risked their lives when they went on the plain diet which they preferred, in lieu of the diet prescribed for them, which they refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same spirit on the part of the Devil and his minions can be seen in the conspiracy against Daniel’s three friends on the flat refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to bow down to the image in the plain of Dura, and in the subsequent futile effort to have them destroyed in the flames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yet once again see the vicious ungodly attempt to interfere with Daniel’s freedom of worship and which had for its objective his death in the lions’ den.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>In the Days of Jesus</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Consider how Herod sought the death of Jesus while He was still a babe. Mark the successful plot against the life of John the Baptist. See the triple temptation of the Devil against Jesus, any one of which, if complied with, would have resulted in His destruction, and one of these was this very matter of falling down before the Devil in an act of homage which can properly be given only to Jehovah God. See the repeated attempts of the scribes and Pharisees, the hypocrites, to catch Jesus in His words, to get Him into trouble with the Roman government, to destroy His influence with the people, to entice Him away from the path of self-sacrifice, which latter enticement at the hands of Peter the Lord expressly denounced as the work of the Devil. (Mark 8:32,33) And, finally, see the work of Judas, after the Devil entered into him; and see even the attempt of the Devil, through his representatives, to prevent . Jesus’ resurrection by placing guards at His tomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus warned His disciples that He sent them forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, that they would be brought before governors and kings for His sake, that they would be hated of all men, that some would be killed and crucified, some scourged in the synagogues (churches), some persecuted from city to city, some beaten, some betrayed, and some thrust into prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All this was exactly fulfilled. Those familiar with the Acts of the Apostles remember how they were threatened and commanded to speak no more in the name of Jesus; how they were beaten in the presence of the Sanhedrin; how their leaders were put to death and they were scattered abroad everywhere; how they suffered tribulation, distress, persecution, nakedness, peril, sword, hunger, thirst, had no certain dwelling place, were defamed and made as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things. They were beaten with rawhide whips, beaten with rods, were stoned, shipwrecked, robbed, attacked by their own countrymen, attacked by the heathen, attacked in the wilderness, attacked by false brethren and by the bitter cold. And they were thrown into prison, they were robbed of all their earthly possessions, and were finally put to death, some of them by crucifixion—all the work of the Devil and the clergy.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Ambassadors for Christ</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Foreign ambassadors are exempt from saluting every flag except their own.* Jehovah’s witnesses are ambassadors; their citizenship is in heaven. They are not expecting any mercy from the Devil or the clergy; they have had none, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">•Are not foreign ambassadors exempt from saluting the American flag? And If so, where Is the consistency In demanding such procedure from ambassadors for Christ? Anyway, the best method for people to honor a flag Is to live up to the principles upon which a nation Is founded, and not by going through some hypocritical ceremony. On account of Just such hypocritical practices as that, we have In the world today millions of religious and other hypocrites camouflaging their real heart sentiments. —A. Z. Bocker, Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">will get less. Their rights proceed from Jehovah God, and not from man, and Jehovah God will see that they receive what protection He considers best for them to have for the prosecution of the work He has given them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among all the people in the United States there are no citizens more truly loyal than Jehovah’s witnesses. Although they include representatives of every tongue and people, they include a surprising number of persons whose ancestors have been in this country 300 years and more and were making roads and building stone walls while the ancestors of the people who now wish to run the country were but slowly emerging from the pall of stygian darkness of priest-ridden Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is just as well now as any time to remind the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that of the thirty forms in which the flag of the United States has existed, five of them bore the motto “Don’t tread on me”, two of them bore the motto “An Appeal to God”, one bore the motto “An Appeal to Heaven”, two bore the words “Liberty or Death”, four more bore the word “Liberty”, and one bore the word “Hope”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just at hand, in the Columbus (Ohio) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font11"> of November 16, under the subhead “Courageous Souls”, occurs the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To salute a flag,” Judge Rutherford said in a radio address about a month ago, “means, in effect, that the person saluting ascribes salvation to what that flag represents, whereas salvation is of Jehovah God.” Judge Rutherford went on to say that at the present time more than 1200 of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison in Germany because they refused to shout “Heil Hitler!” From our own contacts with these people at two of their international gatherings held here we would say that they are definitely of the stuff of which martyrs are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Primitive Christians were the same as Jehovah’s witnesses. They counted not their lives dear unto themselves. It was the law of the Roman realm that Caesar be considered a god. Caesar’s title was Pontifex Maximus. The early Christians, because they were ambassadors for Christ, refused to shout “Ave Caesar” or “Salve Caesar” or “Hail Caesar”, and were therefore butchered to make a Roman holiday.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">After the death of the Lord and the apostles the Devil executed his masterpiece of all time by gradually weakening the power of the Roman emperors and removing their headquarters to Constantinople so that he could, and did, make the ambitious bishop of Rome his personal representative. He bestowed on this bishop, who assumed to be the successor of Peter, but was really the spiritual successor of Judas, the title of Pontifex Maximus. He did this because he fully believed that the best way to dishonor Jehovah God’s name in the earth would be to have the service of Jehovah God appear in the eyes of the people as a shameless thing seeking the favor of earthly potentates, conniving to take their place in the minds of the people, teaching doctrines that outrage every sense</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Peter's Roman Catholic Chnrch, in New Brunswick, N. J., in May, 1901, had as one of the features a question box. One Friday night the following question was found therein;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Does the Roman Catholic Church regard Protestants as heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even unto death, if necessary ? &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It was answered by Rev. Harney a* follows:—“In a way I say Yes. Certainly the Church does consider Protestants as heretics, in a way. A formal heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truth of God and the Roman Catholic Church. No one, by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead other* into sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“ I do not doubt, if they were strong enough, that the Catholic people would hinder, even unto death, if necessary, the spread of heresy (such errors), through the people, and I say rightly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“A* human society protects itself against the murderer and the man who proves to be a traitor to the Government, so the Church of God has a right to protect itself.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Sunday following this meeting, a reporter for the Nw York H«roid interviewed the priest and in that interview Father Harney stated that his remarks on the Friday evening, as given above, were correct. He said they expressed his persona] convictions, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and were in accord with thoee of the Roman Catholic Church.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pellowthip Porum,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> May, 1934.</span></p>

Phelan, editor of the St. Louis </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wet tern Watchman,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> was received in special audience by the Pope in 1905 and 1913. Said this celibate in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchman:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> “We would like to rack and quarter Protestantism; we would like to impale it and hang it up for crows to build nests of; we would like to tear it with pincers and pierce it with red-hot</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In addition to the reading matter on the cartoon, be it noted that in the conduct of the Roman Catholic Inquisition violation of women </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">was a </span><span class="font11">cardinal privilege and practice of inquisitors, who, being above the law and answerable </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font11">to themselves, could commit such crimes of justice and decency and parading around in satin slippers and robes fourteen feet long, the most perfect personification of hypocrisy that it would be possible for the mind of the Devil himself to conceive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this issue there is presented a full-page cartoon entitled “Catholic Action (the Inquisition) Four Centuries Ago”. Examine it carefully and judge for yourself what the Roman Hierarchy is, what it does, and what it intends to do. It is the boast of the Devil that he never changes, and it is a fact that the Roman Hierarchy openly declares its purpose to destroy all Protestants as soon as it feels strong enough.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The only true Church” i* quite as offen*ive in thia Pro-te*tant country a* it i* abroad. Father H. Leiter, SJ., wrote a* follows in the Pope-blessed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unicerte of</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9th March, 1923: “We have said before and we say it again — Protestantism isn’t a religion, it is a disease. The Church has to deal with those affected with the disease as a physician deals with a case of smallpox, or a dentist with a decayed tooth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Cardinal Bourne, the Pope’s chief representative in the British Isles, took a solemn oath (printed in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Telc~ traph</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of 1st December, 1911). in which ha promised “to combat with every effort heretics and schismatics and those rebelling against our Lord the Pop* and his successors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Public men, ignorant of Rome’s uncharitable speech and action, sometimes patronize Papal functions. The Church of Rome teaches plainly that the Protestant Churches are &quot;from the father of lie* and therefore di*p)easing to the God of truth.” They little know the sort of thing they are helping on—a grossly intolerant and offensive foreign system — “the Italian Mission” (to use the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Church Timet'</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> description).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us hope that a perusal of the Bureau’s tracts will open the eyes of the offending public men and women (Rome vilifies the fair sex. See the Bureau’s Tract No. 4) — and that in future they will have nothing whatever to do with what Charles Dickens (no bigot) rightly described as the “most horrible mean* of political and social degradation left in the world,” and John Ruskin as &quot;the most debasing and degrading of all creeds,” while that great Roman Catholic authority, Cardinal Newman, simply stated the truth when he confessed that “the Catholic Church is encumbered with it* connection with moribund nations.” Let </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> suffice I</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">with impunity. Even the king of Spain dismissed complaints on this matter sent him by whole towns and boroughs, because it would decrease the number of victims and cut into his percentage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As in Europe the property of the condemned was seized to keep the Inquisition going and the king in pocket money, so in the United States, the wealth of the nation is being seized through colossal appropriations to build up an organization and keep it going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Simple folks used to go to Rome to buy immunity from the fires of the Inquisition from the pope and were ignorant of the fact that the pope and the inquisitors had an understanding on such matters, and that the immunity wasn’t worth the paper on which it was written. They realized it gradually as the fire began to rage around them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It must be strikingly evident to any student of history that the Inquisition had more to do with settlement of America than all other factors put together. They came here in thousands to escape the clutches of the Hierarchy. Hence the expression, “Free America.” And as no country can escape the ravages of these fiends, America is next. It is to be noted that Germany resisted the Inquisition but is now fully under its dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">King Philip, of foul memory, celebrated his escape from shipwreck, and his marriage to Isabella of France, in a genera] </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">auto-da-fe, </span><span class="font11">wherein 66 distinguished “heretics” were burned before his eyes. These human victims, chained to the stake, were the blazing torches which lighted the monarch to his nuptial couch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Victor Hugo estimated the number of victims of the Inquisition at five millions, it is said, and certainly the number was much greater than that if we take into account, as we should, the wives and husbands, the parents and children, the brothers and sisters, and other relatives of those tortured and slaughtered by the priestly institution. To these millions should properly be added the other millions killed in the wars precipitated in the attempt to fasten the Inquisition upon the people of various countries as The Netherlands and Germany,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Wrath upon All “Desirable Banners”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">No prophet is more often quoted by the Lord Jesus Christ than the prophet Isaiah. Notice the following plain statement that in the day of Jehovah, now here, His wrath is upon all, to men of the world, “desirable banners,” all the flags of all the nations of the earth, and because it is important for men to know some of the other things upon which the wrath of Jehovah now rests, the entire passage of Isaiah 2:11-21 is here given as it appears in Rotherham’s translation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lofty looks of mean men shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of great men shall be bowed down,— and [Jehovah] alone shall be exalted in that day. For a day of [Jehovah] of hosts shall be upon every one who is high and lofty,—and upon every one who is lifted up and he shall be brought low; and upon all cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,—and upon all the oaks of Bashan; and upon all the lofty mountains,—and upon all the uplifted hills; and upon every high tower,—and upon every fortress wall; and upon all the ships of Tarshish,—and upon all desirable banners. And the haughtiness of mean men shall be humbled, and the loftiness of great men shall be laid low,—and [Jehovah] alone shall be exalted in that day. And the idols shall wholly pass away; and they shall enter into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of clay,—because of the terribleness of [Jehovah] and for his majestic splendour, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. In that day shall the son of earth cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,—which had been made for him to worship, into the hole of the mice and to the bats; that he may enter into the clefts of the rocks, and into the fissures of the crags,—because of the terribleness of [Jehovah] and for his majestic splendour, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The wrath of God is now upon the red banners of Russia, Morocco, and Zanzibar?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Spanidi monarchs carried the Inquisition into the low countries and, as stated in their records, burnt all who refused to recant Protestantism, and beheaded all who abjured it. Five million lost their lives, said Victor Hugo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among those that suffered martyrdoms of burning alive and beheadings because they denounced the mass, the trinity and the pope himself as antichrist were Peter aW/z Waldo, John Huss, Rogers, Tyndale, Jerome of Prague.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">THE INQUISITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mercy of the Inquisition was more to be dreaded than its condemnation, since the mere arrest of a “suspicious” person was enough to condemn him, his descendants and relatives for generations to an infamous life as social and political pariahs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Just as the king of Spain sold his subjects to the Inquisition to gain their wealth, so today we find Roosevelt selling the free citizens of the United States to a Papal program of absolutism and commercial and political chaos, in return for the support of that diabolical organization.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">In Washington, D.C., methods used by the president and his aides are purely Hierarchy methods. To those men or organizations that threaten the prestige of the president they offer the threat of a Congressional investigation. Such an investigation would imply improper conduct of the investigated and would turn them over to an angry populace for political or commercial death by boycott; a kind of excommunication, as it were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Germany, flogging, beheading and torture are meted out to those who offend or question Hitler’s inquisitorial tyranny. The Hitler government’s mania for ‘‘pure Aryan blood” is a revival of what in Spain was called “Limpieza’ when almost every person’s ancestry was examined for the condemnatory trace of Jewish or Moorish blood.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">As in the Inquisition’s rule of action (the &quot;heretic” was tried by torture and turned over to the secular arm for execution), so today Catholic priests and their henchmen, judging Jehovah’s witnesses as guilty of a crime against the “holy faith”, turn them over to cringing magistrates for punishments of fines and imprisonments.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Roman Catholic newspapers hail Roosevelt as Pontifex Maximus of the pope’s encyclical, otherwise known as NRA, AAA, etc. These alphabetical organizations are well calculated, by threat and coercion to force every person or organization to acknowledge the president as Supreme Pontiff without appeal and without liberty of censure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">To create hatred and prejudice, the Catholic-dominated organizations, school boards, news agencies and newspapers cause the motive and importance of Jehovah’s witnesses’ refusal to salute a flag to be misunderstood. This policy is in line with the lying conduct of the popes and inquisitors when they burned in effigy those who escaped their clutches by flight or death. Whipping and expelling of children, and discharging of teachers, reflect the brutal character of the instigators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In various state capitals, laws putting the clergy above public eensure or questioning have been passed, or are awaiting passage. Just as the inquisitors were above the law, religious or state, and could commit any crime with impunity, no matter how dastardly, because they answered only to themselves for all they did.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Hundreds of Other Flags</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Besides the national flags or territorial flags mentioned there is the so-called “church” flag with a cross on it; there are boy scout flags; there are regimental flags for possibly every one of the thousands of regiments of soldiers all over the earth; there are fifty steamship lines plying out of New York harbor, each with its different flag; there are thousands of college flags, and municipal flags; there are numerous state flags, business flags and other flags galore; and if any one of these flags presumes to demand or is willing to accept the worship which belongs to God alone, then the wrath of God is upon that flag as well as upon the banners under which men go to war in their violation of the everlasting covenant.—Genesis 9:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The salute of the Roman legionnaires consisted of stretching out the right hand, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">palm upward,</span><span class="font11"> toward their leader </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(dux, duce</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fuehrer),</span><span class="font11"> Caesar Divus (deified Caesar), who was also their pontifex maximus (high priest), and thereby doing homage to the representative of Satan, the god of this world, and of shouting “Ave Caesar!” or “Salve Caesar!” the same as “Heil Hitler!” is today obligatory in Germany or “Viva il Duce!” in Italy, accompanied by the old idolatrous salute of pagan Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now compare this with the “American Flag Code, adopted by the Flag Convention of June 14, 1923” as published by The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Washington, D.C., in their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Manual of the United States,</span><span class="font11"> 1930, page 29:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Pledge to the Flag.” “The following is a pledge to the flag of the United States: ‘I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’ The pledge is repeated facing the flag, with the right hand held over the heart. At the words ‘to the flag’, the right hand is extended, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">palm upward,</span><span class="font9"> toward the flag. This position is held until the last word is spoken. Persons in uniform should render the military salute.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the gladiators of Pagan Rome, who were about to slavishly shed their lifeblood on the sand of the arena for the sadistic pleasure of their perverse ruling class, entered the Circus Maximus, they extended their right hand, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">palm upward,</span><span class="font11"> toward the royal box of the emperor and shouted: “Ave Caesar, morituri te salu-tant!” (Hail Caesar, the ones who are about to die salute thee!) Today that homage of Roman slaves, which has now been revived by Romanists in America, takes on a most ominous significance. Rome herself makes no effort to conceal her murderous plans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">To re-establish the Inquisition in the United States, as is now being done, necessitates the full control of means by which the people may be reached with information or misinformation. The mob spirit is easily aroused. Though Jesus fed the hungry, healed lepers and paralytics, drove out demons, gave sight to the blind, opened deaf ears and raised the dead, Satan's publicity department aroused the mob to spit in the face of Jesus, crown Him with thorns, strip Him of His clothing, nail Him to a tree between two thieves, and mock Him in His death agonies. The mob spirit is never far below the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The servant is not above his master. In the World War the newspapers of the United States fanned millions into temporary insanity by the skillful construction and publication of falsehoods. The House of Morgan guaranteed to the French government that they would put the United States into the war on the side of the allies, and they did. Ask George Creel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the moment, the Devil, Gog, his prime minister, and his various mouthpieces, operating at the behest and under the direction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are determined that Fascism (Catholic Action) shall take the place of liberty in the United States. To that end it is necessary to seize the schools. This seizure is now under way. The following item is from the Newark (N. J.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Neivs</span><span class="font11"> of November 13, 1935, setting forth a portion of this plan for the Garden State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Delegates to the Essex Division, Newark Federation of the Holy Name Society, meeting last night at St. Joseph’s School Hall, indorsed a resolution sponsored by Rev. Dr. Ralph J. Glover, head of the Associated Catholic Charities, at the recent crime conference calling for religious instruction in all schools. The delegates authorized Thomas M. Kane, head of the legislative committee, to advocate at the next session of the Legislature legislation requiring all persons to salute the American flag. Officers were nominated to be elected next month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Residents of the Keystone State will be interested to know that politicians guided by the Devil make it possible for a teacher to murder a pupil and go scot-free. All the teacher has to do is to convince the court there was no malice in his act of murder. Now let Americans who wish to get a good look at what will happen in the United States when The Associated Press has succeeded in fully subordinating this country to the pope consider the following report of happenings in Canonsburg in the week of November 4, 1935. These sufferings were brought upon these innocent children by the willful and malicious arousing of the mob spirit in Canonsburg, Pa., by George A. Anderson, editor of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font11"> of that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Anna Prinos. (Teacher, Miss Ruth Aiken, Protestant, daughter of Presbyterian minister.) Anna was whipped with a stick about 3 by 24 inches by | inch in thickness. Five or six strokes were administered at one time, and seven or eight later; in all, fourteen strokes were given. Whipping administered in presence of principal, another teacher and school janitor. Monday morning Principal Earl S. Davidson grabbed Anna by the throat with both of his hands and shook her repeating “When I make orders I want them obeyed”, and as he repeated this statement he tightened his grip. This grip was such that next day deep marks and bruises were seen on her neck. She tried to shake him off and prevent his choking her entirely, but he overpowered her. After this, Anna was sent out of the room into the hall and she started to cry because of the severe treatment she had received at the hands of Davidson. Just then her own teacher, Miss Aiken, came along and inquired what he had done to her, and on being informed of the circumstances, said to Anna, “Pull yourself together; we don’t think you are sincere,” and with a pat on the back, passed on down the hall. Later Anna was ordered to go down to the basement, to the boiler room; and knowing what it was for, and due to the nervous strain she had been under during the administration of the choking in the classroom, she asked that she might first go to the toilet. This request was refused, and she had to take the beating first! Miss Aiken herself did the beating. Each time Anna jerked she was informed she would get that much more. The girl is 13 years old but is as big as most 15-year-olds. The bruises and marks of welts raised on Anna looked like raw liver, and next day she could scarcely sit, because of the pain. She had to be taken to a doctor. Four Canonsburg doctors were approached to make the examination, but all, being in the clique with the Canonsburg school board, refused, and she had to be brought to Pittsburgh for the examination. She reported for school Wednesday and Thursday, and Thursday was told to stay at home “until called for”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pauline Prinos. (Teacher, Miss Marcella Reagan, Catholic.) Pauline is 12 years old. She too was whipped, with the same stick used on Anna, and the whipping was administered in the boiler room of the school basement. Five strokes given first time, and, three days later, eight more by Principal Davidson, Miss Reagan having administered the first beating. Davidson is a former president of Kiwanis. He was so brave he held little Pauline’s hands behind her back so she couldn’t wince, while he struck her with the stick. Following this severe beating he made her sit in the corner from 11: 00 until 12 o ’clock, and several times asked if she would salute or did she want to go to Morganza. Later he told her to go home and not come back “until called for”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ruth George, nearly 13 years of age. (Teacher, Miss Viola Laskowski, Catholic.) Monday the teacher told Ruth to stand in the corner until the salute exercises were over. Teacher then asked her if she would salute the flag, and upon being informed she could not change her mind, the teacher said Ruth would in later years regret the stand she had taken. Miss Lesknowski told Ruth that her mind was made up, too, and for her to go to the basement. Principal Davidson walked down with them. He offered a good deal of advice about saluting the flag, gave his own viewpoint, and then told Ruth that if she goes out and sells these books, now that she isn’t saluting the flag, the people will not buy them. He compared Judge Rutherford to the monkey getting the chestnuts off the stove, and these children as workers were the cats getting burned, and told her that when they get into Morganza Judge Rutherford will come along and pat them on the back and say “Poor people” and then forget all about them. (This latter statement was made before the entire class after she had returned from the basement.) During the beating operation, when Ruth cried he mockingly said, “I thought Jehovah’s witnesses didn’t feel any pain,” and then he told her teacher to continue the beating. Had to be taken to the doctor on the fourth day, and doctor thought the bruises “pretty bad”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Timothy George, 11 years old. (Teacher, Miss Elizabeth Rush, D.A.R.*) Principal Davidson and janitor<sup>1 </sup>were present while Miss Rush beat Timothy in the boiler room of school basement. He too was told that Jehovah’s witnesses were not supposed to feel any pain. When Timmey started to cry and back up the principal asked if he had to hold him. So Timmey stood his ground and suffered nine more strokes. The beating wasn’t all on the spanking place, one severe bruise being across the boy’s leg, about four inches below the hip, and this mark he carried on him for a week following the beating! Child is very nervous as the result of treatment and the threats of taking him from his parents and placing him in Morganza; so much so that he screams out-in his sleep, and after eating cannot retain food for any length of time. Tuesday he was not able to attend school, but Wednesday morning his parents sent him again. When the principal found him there on Wednesday he said, “Timothy, go home until you are called for; how many times do I have to tell you?” While getting his books ready to leave, principal said, “Hurry up, before I give you another paddling.” The Pittsburgh doctor examined him on Friday and said after five days there was 2| inches of damage, a bad bruise, still on the boy’s leg.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦D.A.R. DIDIES FOR CANONSBURG KIDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now that our patrioteers have beaten up the kids in the primary grades, when are they going to start on the kindergartners? And when that is done, I suppose our patrioteers will start a move for the compulsory use of the star-spangled diaper.—Morrison Sharp, in the Boston </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(This is not stretching it so much as might be imagined. In Chicago, which is now thoroughly Romanized, and where the Catholic teachers In the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">public</span><span class="font8"> schools make it so hot for Protestant teachers that they have to get out, a child was dismissed from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">kindergarten</span><span class="font8"> October 31 because she refused to salute the flag. Listen ! You can hear the carpenters at work on the scaffolds and the knife-makers hammering out the guillotine blades.) </span><span class="font9">thinking he is getting another beating in the school basement behind the hot water boiler!! The children are all very nervous about the thought hanging over them of being taken off to a house of correction and further ill-treated. One of the little girls who was whipped so severely had blisters on her back that looked just like raw liver, and before these were gone her mother sent her back to school and another whipping was administered”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Further reports of the terrible sufferings brought upon these particular children of Jehovah’s witnesses as a result of the activities of The Associated Press, Attorney General Mar-giotti,* and the Canonsburg </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes,</span><span class="font11"> are as follows; and those who remember their school days will know that the humiliations here described caused real suffering to them as well as to Jehovah’s witnesses and to the One who took the little ones in His arms and blessed them and said, “Suffer little children to come unto me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Timothy George. As soon as he entered the room and did not salute the flag the teacher told him to stand in the corner facing toward the blackboard. He stood there two and one-half hours, and in the afternoon he had to stay in one-half hour after school and did not come home until late. The teacher threatened him and said she would paddle him if he did not salute. He said, “If you kill me, I won’t salute.” One day they had a test but she did not give him credit, but gave him a zero on his lessons. The principal had him in the hall for two hours, which was the principal’s punishment in addition to that which the teacher gave him. He has to stand for two and one-half hours for every day he refuses to salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ruth George. The teacher kept her after school one-half hour in the afternoon and evening. She got zero for her work. She was forced to write ‘ ‘ I pledge allegiance to the flag” ten times on paper and on the board. The teacher, Miss Lesknowski, Roman Catholic, never calls this pupil by her name, but calls her “disgraced child” and “anarchist”. She threatened to paddle her but did not do so. She was taken into the presence of pupils of three rooms to answer questions that the principal asked concerning the flag which are not really for a child to answer. The teacher told the other children not to associate with her. This pupil has a bank account at the school, but after this incident the teacher would not let her bank any more, so Ruth decided to take her money out. In order to do so, the children must have a pink slip signed by the teacher; but the teacher would not sign the slip so that she could get her money out, and the principal would not sign it either. The principal, Mr. Davidson, made the statement that if he had his way, he would thrash the children until they did salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦Ill with acute indigestion at Harrisburg November 22, and probably a poor insurance risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Anna Prinos was forced to write “I pledge allegiance to the flag” ten times. She is being passed up in her lessons although she did not receive any zeros; she was merely passed up when it was her turn to read or spell or recite. They also threatened to whip her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pauline Prinos was taken to the front of the room facing the other children and forced to salute the flag five times. They passed her up the same as the others in her studies. The first day that she refused to salute the flag, she misspelled one word and the teacher paddled her for it. Her teacher, instead of calling her by name, calls her “disgraced child”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Inquisition All Over Again</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">As was their duty, the law-abiding parents of these children sought redress in the courts, only to learn of the Pennsylvania “law” that their children can be murdered by teachers and there is no redress. At the same time, Jehovah’s witnesses visited every home in Canonsburg to give the people an opportunity to read the address by Judge Rutherford on the subject </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Saluting a Flag”,</span><span class="font11"> which address-appeared in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font11">No. 420. The Associated Press five times asked for the information contained in that address, but gave it to the public in garbled form. Their action was that of women, not men, and not very good women at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The presiding judge, Brownson, of Washington county, Pa., decided that the children remain with their parents, and recommended that they attend school and at flag-saluting time be segregated from other children; but McVay, the school-board superintendent, held the recommendation of the court in contempt and refused to allow the children to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Immediately a threat was made that these children, unusually intelligent, unusually conscientious, and always hitherto obedient, should be incarcerated in state penal institutions on charges of incorrigibility because they could not be forced to worship the American flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Similar acts of terrorism were perpetrated against little ones of Jehovah’s witnesses at New Salem, Pa., Royal, Pa., Nemacolin, Pa., Gates school, German township, Pa., Minersville, Pa., and many other places, under Attorney General Margiotti’s jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At New Salem, Pa., two little children were expelled from school; the teacher of these children was a Roman Catholic; the next day the father of the children was discharged from his job. This is the normal course of inquisition, as administered by the Roman Hierarchy wherever they can control rulers and sources of public “information”. The Nemacolin children were whipped until they were black-and-blue. One of these little fellows, a dear little boy named Lewis Wiekiewicz, who will not be ten years old until next February, was put on the stand, and testified as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. You went to school and refused to salute the flag? Why? A. It says in the Bible not to salute a flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. What does it say in the Bible? A. It says not to bow down to anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. Do you think it is just the same, to raise your hand or bow down? A. Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. Did your father ever tell you not to salute the flag? A. No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. After your principal told you to go home, at that time what did your father tell you about saluting the flag? Did he say you should or should not salute the flag ? Did he ever tell you that you ought to salute the flag? A. He said, if I wanted to, to go ahead and do it, if I wanted to. He teaches it is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. Did your father ever tell you not to go to school? A. No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. Did he ever tell you to go to school? A. Yes; he wanted me to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. When your principal told you to go back home, did he say anything to you about going to school ? Did he (referring to father) say in any way that you felt he wanted you to go to school ? A. I did go, and they sent me back home because I would not salute the flag. I wanted to go myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Q. You did not go because if you went you would be just sent home because you would not salute the flag? A. Yes.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Another Brutal Attack on the Kids</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">It is wholly unreasonable to expect just or honorable treatment at the hands of the Roman Hierarchy or of anybody that is under their control, directly or indirectly, as is the school board at Canonsburg, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you remember how, when you were a child, you dearly loved the good teacher who, in the early days of life, helped you to determine to do what is right, though the heavens fall? Such a teacher, refined, intelligent, and comely withal, was Grace Estep, of the Canonsburg school, but she is there no longer. The tools of the Hierarchy, in this instance particularly McVay and editor Anderson, were out to take her life as a teacher, and took it. Grace Estep was almost the sole support of a family of eight: the father has no work, and one son, younger than Grace, draws small wages. Her family has lived in Canonsburg, Pa., for fifty years. Her father went through the same schools in which Grace taught, and when the Rome-controlled school board removed her from her position because she failed to salute the flag, they took the living away from the family and to all intents and purposes are murderers.—1 John 3:15; Proverbs 22:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is necessary for school teachers to use their brains, but school boards, like other boards, are long and narrow, and wooden.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Canonsburg Appeals (Indirectly) to the Pope</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The middle of October, when the Canonsburg </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font11"> had started mob hysteria against Miss Estep, Dr. H. S. Pease, the president of the school board, which school board subsequently flatly refused to be governed by the court advice, to educate the expelled children pending settlement of legal questions involved, appealed to Attorney General Charles A. Mar-giotti for a ruling in the case. Margiotti, being a papist, and therefore not a good American, showed his Roman Catholic proclivities and sympathies. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> No. 423, pages 136,137, and the interesting comments there on the refusals of William Penn, William Tell, and the prophet Daniel, respectively, to kowtow to King Charles II, the tyrant Gessler, and old King Nebuchadnezzar.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font11"> began its campaign to destroy Miss Estep as a teacher the young lady’s first communication to the editor of that sheet was as follows, and speaks for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The account given in last night’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font9"> of my refusal to salute was not presented in a very just manner. I should like this chance of explaining the situation to those of you who have always been my loyal friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The paper states that I am reported to have refused to require the flag salute. That absolutely is not </span><span class="font11">true, </span><span class="font9">as I was never asked to require the salute. The truth of the matter is, it never occurred to me. No flag salute is required in high school, and none is required in college (except, perhaps, spasmodically). Being unused for six years to having the salute brought to my attention, it never entered my mind to have it when I began teaching. During the years I’ve taught the principal has been in my room at various times while I was having opening exercises, and never noticed that I didn’t have flag salute. As soon as it was brought to my attention, I began having it daily. Does that sound like refusal? And I have broken no state law; for the code does not require this. Section 629 requires simply—in regard to flags—that one should be displayed upon or near each public school building, and also that a flag be displayed within each building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I, personally, do refuse to salute the flag. We are told in the Bible to give honor, or allegiance, to no man and to nothing man-made. All glory and honor are Jehovah God’s, and a Christian would be committing a sin in worshiping the flag, just as the three who were cast into the fiery furnace would have been committing a sin had they worshiped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am not a radical nor a “red”, as you who have known me all my life certainly know. I appeal to the parents of the girls and boys who have been in my room: has there ever been a time when your children have learned anything radical or unpatriotic in my room? You know there has not been. And they have been taught as much about the principles of cur country and about our great men as have the children in any other room. I am probably a great deal truer to the principles for which that flag stands than are many of those who are so determined to have me “bow down and worship” the emblem which they “have set up ’ ’. Do not misunderstand—I would never show any disrespect to the flag nor to the fine principles it represents. But as a Christian, and also one of “Jehovah’s witnesses”, I cannot give honor to anything man-made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a Christian, I am also opposed to militarism—to the taking of human life. The same flag, flying so peacefully over our school has—together with the much-saluted emblems of other nations, and in direct disobedience to the commandment “Thou shalt not kill”—flown over masses of men gone mad with the lust for blood. We cannot salute the flag of love and peace without saluting as well the flag of horror and hate and destruction, for they are one and the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Reverence” for the flag does not necessarily produce high ideals and honest, unselfish patriotism. In fact, ’most everyone who gives the salute and repeats the pledge does so mechanically, giving little or no thought to the significance of it. And many of those who are the worst enemies of the country’s welfare make much ado of saluting the flag and are vociferous in their championship of it. Why not? &quot;They think they shall be heard for their much speaking.” I appreciate that ours is the greatest nation in the earth, but the liberties guaranteed its citizens are being trampled on by some who use the flag hysteria to forward mass action for the furtherment of their own selfish ends. They seem to forget, they and these heads of high patriotic organizations, that we have a Constitution which guarantees religious freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems that a person may be a liar, a swindler, or a racketeer; he may be thoroughly unprincipled, thoroughly immoral, and still be accepted as a good American. But let it be discovered that he is a Christian, and he is branded immediately as an undesirable citizen. Yet it was on the principles of Christianity that this nation was founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If there are any parents of pupils who have been in my room who feel that their children have been demoralized by having had me as their teacher, I wish they would say so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In fairness to me I expect the paper to carry this letter.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Eagerness to Destroy the Estep Family</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The eagerness of the Canonsburg </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes </span><span class="font11">to destroy Grace Estep as a teacher may be judged from the fact that four of its silly editorials on the subject run a total of fifty inches. There is no use to reprint these “editorials”, but they are unmanly and ignoble to the last degree. They resulted as hoped and intended. The one in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font11"> of November 4, 1935, is particularly exasperating to a man. It says, in part (George A. Anderson is the editor):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now that the Estep case has been settled insofar as the school board is concerned, and the teacher who refused to take part in the customary salute of the flag has been dismissed, to take effect next week, it is hoped that the unpleasant affair will be allowed to die and that the general operation of the schools of the borough will not be seriously affected. The teacher has the right to be heard, if she cares </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9"> appear before the board. It is not known what her decision will be on this phase. It is believed that if she is acting independently and because of her personal convictions, she will drop the matter. If, however, she is being prompted by some central personage connected with the cult calling itself “Jehovah’s witnesses”, the organization might capitalize on the local situation by forcing the case into court. There have been instances similar to the local one in various parts of the state and the country. Others, however, involve students only. There is a possibility that there is a concerted movement under way to bring the cult into the limelight and nothing would be more inviting to them than a court trial with all the fanfare and eloquence that usually attends such procedure. Any controversy involving interpretation of the Bible is bound to attract attention and if the radio broadcaster at the head of the cult can succeed in getting a public airing, he stands to gain a nation-wide publicity of incalculable, although somewhat questionable, value.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>A Cowardly Squawk</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Anderson's above cowardly squawk speaks for itself. Here is a man cowardly enough to get a woman out of a job, and then has the gall to hope that she will “drop the matter”. That is like a gangster that binds and gags his victim and warns him not to make any outcry. Nevertheless, the editor of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font11"> probably learned something on Sunday, November 3, when Jehovah’s witnesses covered his city with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> No. 420 and the same issue which contained the foregoing editorial also contained the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am hoping you will have the what-it-takes to give this the same space as occupied by your Thursday’s front-page editorial. I was in my fifth year of attending, strictly, quietly, and well, to my business of teaching the second grade, when you began shouting an alarm to your public and pointing in horror to my classroom. And now, when attracted by your shouting and pointing, the Pittsburgh daily papers send their camera men and reporters to try and find out for their public what it is all about, you begin crying out that I and my friends are seeking publicity. The smallness of such contemptible vindictiveness as your kind has displayed should shame men of any moral stature. And what a pity it is that some people who have so much to say haven’t the nerve to write above their omi signatures, but must hide their cowardly venom behind the screen which someone else affords—a transparent screen, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You may think that the ultimate has befallen me when you shall have assisted in accomplishing my dismissal—and I have indeed cherished my teaching privilege above most things in life—but I claim a share in the comforting assurance of the last verse of the fiftyfourth chapter of Isaiah. Read it, and think it over.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Also a lifelong treasure will the memory be of my association with the children whom I have had the pleasure of teaching. They have proved that they will remember me lovingly and gratefully in later life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are the things that you and your kind can neither give nor take away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sometime the people may reclaim their schools from the rule of jingoism and return to the business of educating children.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Associated Press Caught in Another Lie</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The New Britain (Conn.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font11"> of November 7, 1935, contains a dispatch from Canonsburg, Pa., November 7, marked “A.P.”, containing the following paragraph: “If you weren’t so dumb,” she told the board members, “you would do a little investigating and become members yourself.” Miss Estep denies that she ever made any such statement, and inasmuch as her whole concluding statement was made in written form to guard against Anderson’s lies, and inasmuch as it was published in full in the Washington (Pa.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Reporter</span><span class="font11"> of November 8, it is reproduced herewith; and The Associated Press can explain this also, if it will, in connection with the other lies about Jehovah’s witnesses, which it has told and is telling throughout America.<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark63">3</a></sup> Let every honest American read Miss Estep’s statement and see that she did not make the statement she is alleged to have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have come to the hearing tonight, not because I expect any measure of consideration or justice from any of you, but because I greatly resent having my course of action laid out for me by our local newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There can be no honest complaint concerning my efficiency. And I have not refused my pupils the right to salute the flag. They carry on the entire exercise quietly and efficiently themselves. That I did not participate would never have been noticed, especially in view of the fact that pupils are taught from first grade on to take a highly personal interest in many classroom activities, and to carry them through wholly independent of the teacher. If the words they are taught to repeat mean anything to them, the benefit derived from their saying them will be the same regardless of who does or does not take part. If the words thus repeated mean nothing to them, then they are a useless mummery and the participation of the teacher would add no value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I agree that the school authorities should see to it that they safeguard our schools against radical and alien powers and influences. But under neither of these can I be listed. In fact, our organization has done more than any other group in America to check the growth and rule of a foreign power in this country. You have treated me as an undesirable citizen, yet there can be no doubt in your minds that I am a good American citizen—my ancestors have been in this country much longer, probably, than most of yours. I have lived in this town for 19 years and received all of my education here except for two years spent in college. I am not a loud-mouthed, hypocritical patriot with an axe to grind, but I am a loyal, law-abiding citizen and you’ve never had reason to think otherwise. This being the case, there is no logical reason for your acting as you have except prejudice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This entire rabid situation has been based on narrow unreasoning prejudice. I want you to know that I know you are not acting in accordance with any state law. The disposition which you make of such cases as arise is entirely based upon your wishes in the matter. You have attempted by misconstruing relevant factors to make it appear that you have no choice in the matter. But that is ludicrous, coming on top of the issue which you have seen fit to make of the whole thing since it first came to your attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The personal aspect, so far as at least one of you is concerned, has been the dominating factor from the very first, deny it as you might. This animosity has been a driving force allowing you [McVay] to feel no measure of shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the rest of you, you have worked under the eager guidance of organized patriots. They have a very strange idea about what goes to make up good citizenship. Such flag-waving hysteria is always accompanied by threats of violence and acts of cruel coercion. Instances of where pupils have been beaten for refusal to participate in an oath which is against their religious convictions are examples of this. In other instances mass violence and punishments which would do credit to the Dark Ages have been advocated. They all display a very un-American-like spirit, yet of such stuff are these organizations and their exponents composed. And if you should be able by bulldozing and browbeating to compel a person to salute the flag, just exactly what do you think you have accomplished ? How much love of country and respect of flag do you think you have instilled in them by your coercion? And how many degrees do you think you have raised yourselves in the esteem and respect of anyone else who has knowledge of your actions? Loyalty and devotion cannot be compelled. And realizing this, the whole argument in favor of compulsion by corporal punishment, ridicule, or dismissal falls to the ground. Can you expect to be recognized as exponents of liberty or justice while engaging in such persecution ? For your own good you should not allow unreasoning hatred to outweigh common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have been taught to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done, on earth as it is done in heaven.’ That time will come shortly, and when it does there will be no place in the scheme of things for those who would deal in persecution of others. Remember the words of Jesus, and search your own consciences while remembering them: “As ye have done it unto one of the least of these ... ye have done it unto me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">F A MAN believes on the Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior, is it necessary for him to then be baptized in water? Yes; and when you understand the purpose of baptism you will readily agree. When Jesus reached the age of thirty years He met John at the river Jordan and requested John to baptize Him in the water. John at first declined, because he did not understand the purpose. Jesus replied to him: ‘Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness’; and then John baptized Him. The baptism of Jesus in the water was an outward testimony that He had agreed to do the will of God. Jesus said: ‘Lo, I come to do thy will, 0 God.’ “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me.” (Psalm 40: 7,8; John 4:34) When Jesus came up out of the water, the Scriptures say, ‘a voice from heaven was heard saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am -well pleased.’ Thus God expressed His approval of the act of obedience on the part of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ does not mean merely a mental conclusion that Jesus is the Son of God and Savior of the world. It means much more than that. It means that the person agrees to be governed by the will of God and not by the will of another. Belief, therefore, includes the act of consecrating oneself to God, which means an agreement to do the will of God, thus exercising faith. In that manner the person is justified, and, being justified, he has access into the favor of God. (Romans 5:1) In order to continue to receive the favor of God he must continue to do the will of God. He having agreed to do God’s will, the proper thing for him then is to declare, confess and witness that he has so agreed; and this he does by submitting himself to be immersed in water. The real baptism is the consecration or agreement to do God’s will, and the water baptism is the outward confession in the presence of witnesses. Baptism is therefore a proper step for every person who has given himself to God through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus sent His disciples forth with the commission to teach the people and to baptize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(Matthew 28:19,20) It is the duty of every one who is a witness for Jehovah to teach his fellow creatures the truth, which includes the privilege of baptism, and which baptism is administered in the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus and of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Does that mean that every person who is baptized in water is baptized into Christ’s death! No; because only those are baptized into Christ’s death who are accepted by Jehovah as a part of the sacrifice, begotten of the spirit of God, and called to be members of the royal organization of Jehovah. Concerning such it is written, in 2 Timothy 2: ‘If we be dead with Him, we shall live with Him; if we suffer with Him, we shall reign with Him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many persons who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but who are not called to a place in the kingdom of God, yet love God, and desire to serve Him. All such who have agreed to do the will of God give evidence of such agreement by performing the symbol of water baptism. Then having agreed to do the will of God such persons must study His Word and thereby grow in knowledge and an understanding of His will. In this manner one takes his stand on the side of God and Christ and continues to maintain his integrity toward Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Who may administer baptism to another? Are the services of a clergyman required? The services of a clergyman are not required. Any man who has consecrated himself to do the will of God may act as administrator in baptizing another. Is it necessary for that administrator to use any form of words at the time of baptizing another? No; it is not necessary for him to use any words whatsoever. It is proper before administering water baptism to say to those who are about to be baptized words to this effect : “You have confessed that you were born sinners, have exercised faith in God and in Christ, and at your request I will baptize you by the authority of God and Christ Jesus exercised in the spirit of the Lord.” Should those who claim to be Jonadabs be baptized in water? Yes, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">they have consecrated themselves to do the will have taken their stand on the side of God and of God. By that means they declare that they His kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">How many of us who are past middle age ever saluted the flag? Is our love for country and the flag itself any the less because we were taught the spiritual significance of our love for our country and that the flag is merely the symbol of our devotion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It seems strange, too, that any one in these enlightened days should be forced against honest religious convictions to do some act, the refusal of which is neither criminal nor immoral and not necessarily unpatriotic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Loyalty to flag and country is all good and well; and who would be a traitor? but the continual waving of that flag is not conducive to righteousness. Many people today, especially among politicians, would salute anything that had any easy money in it, but when you find a person today turning down a salary for a standard of living, you may rest assured that you have found one more of a type that is almost as extinct as the dodo. H. G. Wells, the foremost writer and thinker of the day, sums it up this way in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Collier’s</span><span class="font11"> for May 18,1935:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The primary mental fact in the individual mind in the world today is reaction and resistance. This is most evident in the matter of war. We know that the next war is going to be a fundamentally different thing from the wars of the past. It is going to be a horror of mechanism, gas and pestilence that may go far to dissolve any thing like a civilized order altogether ; and it is moreover as plain as daylight that it needs only the fiat of five or six great governments willing to fuse their foreign offices, for war to cease from the world for ever. But we do so love our waving flags, our competitive patriotism, the brave uniforms, and the band, that we cannot nerve ourselves for that strange new calm of a boundless world at peace. Even another world war may be needed before we bow to the plain logic of the situation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Personally, I think this punishment was not only utterly silly, but downright unjust. It is one of the most important principles of American freedom that the State shall not in any way interfere with our freedom of religious belief. Inasmuch as the schools are administered by the State, they should naturally refrain from any such interference. The punishment is silly because the mere act of saluting the flag does not inspire any patriotic feeling unless it is done willingly and wholeheartedly, and to be punished for something which is not wrong is apt to make the receiver of the punishment bitter against what he considers his persecutors; so more harm is done than good.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font11">ID you read the news story of the 5 children out in Pennsylvania who face a term in a reform school? They didn’t steal a cent nor destroy property. Neither did they assault anyone or do any of the many misdeeds for which children are sent to a reformatory. But they refused to salute the American flag! And for this they may be sent to an institution which will leave its imprint and stain on them for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now the poor kids don’t know hardly what it is all about. They happen to be from homes whose parents are members of a certain religious sect which believes in making obeisance only to God. And so, naturally, those parents instructed the children not to salute the flag. And so some of these 100-percent or maybe 1000-percent patriots are threatening to sentence the youngsters to a reformatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How these busybodies in patriotism can find things through which to show silliness! Punishing, so drastically, mere children for the matter of a salute about which they have no understanding. Will these children be more patriotic by sending them to such a school? Is the saluting of the flag such an act of patriotism? Is this shallow action of saluting a guarantee of our loyalty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the war we found many who stood very proudly on the street corner to salute the flag and then went and knifed the country in the back through profiteering. There are many “big fellows’’ who claim 1000-percent patriotism in wrapping the selfsame flag about them and in their economic and political policies are virtual traitors to their country. Now we are not condoning the lack of respect to the flag. But what particular difference does it make if a certain small religious sect feels that way? A trifling matter, but it does afford some of these ultrapatriots a chance to “shine” a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We hope that American loyalty is more than saluting a flag. If these finicky birds want to search out disloyalty, let them go into the four hundred and elite who are undermining the moral structure of the land. Let them check up on the exporters who are trading with warring nations and who may cause America to be drawn into another war. Oh, there are so many real acts of real disloyalty that could keep them so busy that they would not even find time to bother with a few kids who failed to salute a flag.—Willmar (Minn.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Tribune.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">ASE after case of pupils failing to salute Old Glory are coming to public notice. Usually these cases wind up by throwing the offending pupil out of school. Now it seems to us that a pupil who refuses to salute the flag needs a lot more education in patriotism than the saluters, and that the practical effect of this drastic penalty is comparable to biting off the nose to spite one’s face. But, then, wisdom is justified of her children, even as the Great Teacher taught two thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Locally, the Reserve Officers of our army establishment have gone on record as favoring the compulsory flag salute in the common schools. This confirms our warning that the enforcing of the flag salute has its military complications. Such enforcement now carries a distinctly military flavor. As we come to see the matter more clearly, the flag salute is an elementary military gesture, made compulsory at this particular juncture by chauvinistic educators as a step towards Nazism against which the heart of the true patriot recoils in horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Patriotism cannot be forced by hothouse methods. It is questionable whether saluting the flag is any indication of genuine patriotism which in America must root in democracy, for we find a child while saluting the flag would snicker at the suggestion that he oughtn’t to take advantage of his comrade. Mock patriotism is worse than frank disinclination to salute. A child that has had the benefit of home training may see the hollowness of the performance— and have his intelligence insulted by unfeeling school sergeants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Patriotism on parade occupies in many hearts the same low level as display prayers, and but little inspiration accompanies the saluting of the flag in company with rascals. And usually— if punishment is the main thing, as it appears to be—the non-saluter is punished adequately through ostracization by his fellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Through blundering (and we wonder whether the religious issue has not been injected by the school authorities against the non-saluters) the matter has been catapulted into state-wide prominence by the guardians of military patriotism that is far out of proportion to its deserts.—Altoona (Pa.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Beacon.</span></p>

An armed soldier, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to tell you </span><span class="font11">when to take off your hat, will follow just as naturally.

<p><span class="font11">University of Chicago, says patriots are not made by compulsion. Perhaps that is too broad a statement for a generalization. It is quite possible that a Communist patriot, a Fascist patriot, a Nazi patriot can be made by the processes of suppression and compulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are quite sure, however, that an American patriot cannot be made that way, which probably is what Dr. Hutchins had in mind. We are forced to that conclusion because that method of patriot-making is foreign to all that America and its constitution and flag stand for. What that is has been expressed by numerous phrases, freedom of conscience, academic freedom, free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion. But it all sums up to the same thing, the liberty of the individual to his own private opinions, the liberty to form them by examining all the evidence available, the liberty to express them freely, even to the extent of criticism of those who occupy positions of political authority over him. That is the very cornerstone of our democratic republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Persecuting little children because they have been brought up in a cult with conscientious scruples against doing obeisance to a symbol of earthly authority, insulting teachers by questioning their good citizenship, harrying college students because in their youthful enthusiasm they may feel they have found something better than the existing order, these are not the way to promote the ideals of government of the people, by the people and for the people. What they do is only to ape the methods of those systems of</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Dr. Hutchins traces the source of these persecutions to “the hysteria of those who want to do something but don’t know what”. That hysteria is born of a fear of something foreign to our own traditions, but it takes the form of flattering the foreigner by imitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However different their economic objectives may be, there is something strikingly similar about </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the political</span><span class="font11"> governments of Russia, Italy and Germany. The emphasis on military force, the suppression of free speech, the suppression of a free press, meddling with religion, the blood purge, are common to all of them. They are hateful to the American sense of civil liberty. They are no less hateful when the spirit which is back of them appears in our own land under the guise of protecting our own institutions from foreign influence.—Omaha </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World-Herald.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font11">HEY have actually been expelling little children from our public schools because these little ones have declined to salute the flag. Why did they do it? Because they felt we must have a ritual of patriotism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where, pray, on God’s green earth should you put a child who declined to salute the flag unless it be in an American public school?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These people are trying to take charge of teaching patriotism in our colleges and universities. It seems that college professors have run amuck, that they are trying to start revolution in this country. The patriots of Massachusetts have taken us in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are obliged to take an oath to obey the laws of the state. No similar oath is required of newspaper reporters and editors, although they are engaged in education the extent of which greatly exceeds the feeble efforts of our colleges and universities. No similar oath is required of ministers, priests, physicians or of the children’s fathers and mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the professors, the college professors, must take an oath. I still have enough of the blood of those old people (old New Englanders) in my veins to have a profound distrust of people when they develop new interests in ceremonies and symbols. I begin to wonder what it is they are trying to hide behind their rituals.— Dr. Tyler Dennett, president of Williams College, in an address in Cleveland, Ohio, reported in Cleveland </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Dealer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">That sounds like a ridiculous question. Of course you wouldn't. You would patiently teach him respect for motherhood, so that he would appreciate the meaning of the symbol of that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yet in Massachusetts, children have been expelled from school because they will not salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Where, pray, on God’s green earth should you put a child who declined to salute the flag, unless it be in an American public school ?” said Dr. Tyler Dennett, president of Williams College, in an address the other night before the New England Society of Cleveland and the Western Reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dr. Dennett vigorously denounced the “cult of so-called patriots” who have been trying to take charge of teaching patriotism in our schools and colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">His speech is of special interest to Ohio just now, because, down in Jackson, there is a demand for the removal of a school teacher because a fourteen-year-old girl made a pacifistic speech in which she declared that peace would come only when men refused to take up arms, even in defense of their own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We submit that this attempt to deny free speech to the pupil or her teacher is far more subversive than anything that was said in the speech under question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The present trend towards gag legislation in state legislatures, the abridgment of civil liberties, the growing demand for goose-stepping, the repression of free speech and press—all these masquerade under the name of patriotism, a weird patriotism which substitutes symbols and mummery and abacadabra for educated appreciation and love for one’s country. It is the elevation of rites over rights.—Cleveland Yews.</span></p>

Instead of excusing the little chap in the spirit of tolerance shown in Canadian school systems, the Lynn school board went into hysterics for a couple of weeks and then formally moved the expulsion of the eightyear-old from school. In so doing they break the law which insists on every child’s attending school. To be logical and just, the school board members should now prosecute themselves for causing truancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the city solicitor was asked by the board what effect the failure of the child to salute the flag had on his classmates, he replied: “It didn’t seem to have any serious effect. The children are young and things went on as usual.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">N THE Bismarck (N. D.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font11"> the editor goes after the spasm of flag legislation as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For such a law makes a mockery of sincere patriotism. Someone should oppose it on the ground that it cheapens the sentiment which has caused thousands to lay down their lives for their country. It is a mockery of the spirit which brought the nation into being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One suspects that such laws emanate in the minds of the 100-percenters, those sterling patriots who made flaming speeches during the late war—but stayed very comfortably at home; the men who stood on the curb as the troops marched away and adjured the ‘ ‘ doughboys” to ‘‘remember that we are behind you”, then went off to profiteer as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">True patriotism is hardly ever worn on the sleeve. It is something of which to be proud, but not a sentiment to be called up by rote every Tuesday. It is a thing which lights the inner being and spurs people to decent daily living in ordinary times and to deeds of valor in emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And it can hardly be called into being by weekly repetition of an oath in the schools, for familiarity breeds contempt and there is the danger of making a mockery of patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For that reason, someone should oppose such a law on purely patriotic grounds, just as true patriotism is repelled by the thought of compelling a Communist or other non-patriot to kiss the flag. The national emblem deserves better treatment than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The legislature of Massachusetts is liable to have the same experience as that which frequently comes to the woman who insists that her husband tell her every morning that he loves her.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Common Sense in Minnesota</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font11">HE spectacle of young children being thrown out of schools in the east because they refused to go through the formality of pledging allegiance to the flag somehow gripes one’s sensibilities. The child who salutes a flag under duress is not showing respect for it; he is simply indulging in a great hypocrisy at the insistence of his elders. Whatever his motives, religious or otherwise, the pledge of allegiance is worse than meaningless, since it lacks the vital element of sincerity. To expel a child from school because he will not tender the flag a hypocritical salute, as school authorities in Massachusetts recently did, is hardly the best means of encouraging respect for it.—Minneapolis </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman Cult Blesses Murder</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">T HAS become axiomatic that the church follows the flag, eventhough the flag be drenched with the blood of innocent victims of war madness slaughtered in the name of civilization on their native heaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider the Catholic church in Italy. The other day Cardinal Schuster of Milan, one of its great princes, wished “peace and protection” for the armies of Italy which are murdering Ethiopians with air bombs and poison, and blessed them for “opening the doors of Ethiopia to the Catholic faith and the civilization of Rome”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“We must co-operate with God in this national and Catholic mission, above all at this moment when on the fields of Ethiopia the standards of Italy carry to triumph the cross of Christ to break the chains of slavery and open the paths for the missionaries’ gospel,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At almost the same time a Jesuit publication, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Civilita Cattolica,</span><span class="font11"> came out boldly for a mandate over Ethiopia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is at least instructive to find the Catholic church through some of its leading representatives and spokesmen identifying the rape of Ethiopia with the interests of that church. In this, of course, it is running true to form. It entered enthusiastically into the looting of the New World and waxed wealthy off the ill-gotten gain of Spanish and Portuguese adventurers and slavers. Even the immortal Bishop Las Casas, who pleaded in vain in the sixteenth century against the murderous exploitation of the American Indians, suggested as an alternative the importation of Negro slaves from Africa!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And just as the Catholic church has either approved or seldom disapproved this international robbery, exploitation and murder, so have the Protestant churches. Little, if anything, is heard from the missionaries in Africa today, or at any other time, about the ruthless exploitation that has decimated the population of that tragic continent in the past fifty years. Even now in the French, Belgian, British and Portuguese colonies where gold is being ground out of the black bodies of men, women and children with a ruthless cruelty unparalleled in modern times, no word of protest comes from the church supposedly spreading the gospel of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To return to Cardinal Schuster, we can reply that the doors of Ethiopia have never been closed to the Catholic faith. The missionaries of that church have been freely admitted, although the majority of Ethiopians have been Christians longer than have the Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As for the “civilization of Rome”, it has been characterized during the past 2,000 years by every act contradictory to the preachments of Jesus. Murder, robbery, civil war, rapine, treachery and boundless cruelty pockmark its history from Augustus Caesar to Mussolini. Alongside the murderous achievements of this monster, the paltry bush wars and mild chattel slavery of Ethiopia pale into insignificance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is singular that neither Cardinal Schuster nor any other prince of the Catholic church made any audible complaint when Mussolini’s black-shirted thugs were murdering workingmen, destroying their unions and co-operatives, assassinating their spokesmen and representatives and committing other acts of unspeakable hooliganism and vandalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The church protested only when Mussolini was threatening to interfere with its income. And since II Duce and the pope signed their concordat, all has been well along the Tiber, no matter how many liberals and free spirits were beaten, murdered and herded into prison camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In large part, the spiritual weakness of the Christian church today is ascribable to its constant compromise with the evils it is supposed to combat. It has become less outspoken in its championship of right than many atheists. It blessed and defended slavery. It wages no war against color discrimination and segregation. It remains mum on colonial exploitation save in the vaguest terms. Its official attitude on race prejudice and its by-products is ever indistinguishable from that of the ruling class of the section in which it is located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We of a minority group have a perfect right to ask what reason there is for the Christian church’s existence if it is not to vigorously attack those things for which Jesus Christ died. —Pittsburgh (Pa.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Courier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Told This One?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">V </span><span class="font11">SAID ‘Reverend’ Francis D. McCabe, “I told this one” (at Indianapolis, November 11):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ ‘ That child who, under the command of a foreign-born father a few weeks ago, in one of our eastern cities refused to salute the flag of our glorious country should never be permitted to receive public instruction at the expense of loyal citizens, until he shows the respect due to the flag of his adopted country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font11">EHOVAH’S ways are true and righteous always. He has no pleasure in falsehood or wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan is the enemy of God, and therefore the enemy of man. He seeks by every possible means to obscure or suppress the truth. A favorite method of confusing the truth-seeker is Satan’s practice of counterfeiting the truth. He speaks to establish a theory or practice which outwardly appears to be very much like the real thing, but which upon examination is found to dishonor God and to bring sorrow and suffering to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan has succeeded in bringing about many observances which are commonly accepted as true and right. Anyone who dares to call such observance or formalities into question is immediately branded with some opprobrious name and is marked for hatred and persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The time, however, has come for the people to be freed from Satan’s oppressive and deceitful schemes, and a great multitude are awaking to the fact that they have been led astray and caused to follow formalities which have no real power to bring blessings to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan is strong for formalities of every kind, formalities which may be observed by anyone without making any inquiries into their real worth. Whether a person is honest or dishonest, righteous or unrighteous, good or wicked, makes no difference to Satan, as long as he observes the formalities, which are a means Satan employs to keep better-minded people in bondage while his wicked agents have all the freedom they want to follow their unrighteous course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan conies as an angel of light whenever he cannot gain his ends by outright disregard for righteous laws. He will use religion as a cloak and his agents do the same thing. They profess to be very “religious” and thus influence the minds of good people who do not want to condemn others as long as there is some appearance of righteousness about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, the most important thing to remember is that Jesus’ most scathing condemnation was leveled against the formally religious. He did not spare them, and those who follow in Jesus’ footsteps should be just as uncompromising, exposing all that is used to deceive and mislead the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many people have come to a realization of the fact that “Christmas” as it is observed by Christians, imitation Christians, non-Christians and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">186</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">anti-Christians is a hollow mockery, but few realize to what extent this observance dishonors Jehovah God and is used of the Devil to keep the people in a state of bewilderment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Truth Makes Free</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus said, “If ye continue in [obedience to] my word, then are ye my disciples </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">indeed;</span><span class="font11"> and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8: 31, 32) There are many who profess to be Jesus’ disciples who ignore this forceful statement of Jesus. To such are addressed His words, “Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and do-eth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: he is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it; for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.”—Luke 6:46-49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is well to note that Jesus said nothing about observing the date of His birth with a feast of any kind. He did definitely command His disciples to observe a memorial of His death.— Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan is the father of lies and deception. “There is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Christmas” is by no means a blessing. True, some, perhaps many, get a measure of selfish satisfaction out of it, and others may even observe the day with a considerable measure of unselfishness, or at least attempt to do so. But the idea of an “exchange” of gifts is so prominent that unselfish doing of good finds little opportunity to express itself, and those who are unselfish in their giving are nevertheless suspected of having some ulterior motive, in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, the observance of the holiday (not by any means a holy day) puts a strain upon the nerves and a drain upon the purse which many are unable to meet properly, and often more important things are neglected to “make a fair shew in the flesh”.—Galatians 6:</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">12.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">To many people the day is a real burden, and the expression, “I shall be glad when it is all over/’ has a very familiar sound. The relief that is experienced when one has definitely decided to break away from this bondage must be experienced to be appreciated. Of course, one will be misunderstood and also misrepresented, but if the motive is right, that will make very little difference.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Generally Recognized Objections</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The frenzy of spending that accompanies “Christmas”, together with its rushing about and anxiety to get things done in time, leaves many a giver flat, as well as flattening his purse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Often people spend so much at this season of the year that they fail to pay their debts. How often useless and worthless presents are given which nevertheless are high-priced. But the recipient feels that he must smile and pretend to like the gift and make considerable to-do about it, and the result is the fostering of hypocrisy instead of godly sincerity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nor is everybody made happy at “Christmas”, by any means. Children cannot help comparing gifts; and the more fortunate among them are not above making ostentatious display of their gifts, to the saddening of other little hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then there is the practice of telling the children lies about “Santa Claus”. These lies are excused on the ground that it is doing no harm. No lie, however, is of the truth. (1 John 2:21) Nor is the Santa Claus deception a harmless one. Children who learn that there is no real Santa Claus are likely to conclude that there is no real Jesus either, the association of the two names furnishing some grounds for such a conclusion to childish minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider also the tendency to overeat (and overdrink) at this season of the year. Both are intemperate, and therefore condemned in the Word of God. There is much debauchery indulged in by the ungodly and even by some who profess to be Christians. Boisterous drunkenness and wantonness are condemned in Scripture, and are certainly a poor way to celebrate the birth of the Righteous One of God.—Romans 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">True, the poor, or some of them, are remembered at “Christmas”, but they are forgotten the rest of the year. The overfeeding of the poor one day a year does not make up for the neglect the remaining 364 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus said, <sup>&lt;r</sup>Ye have the poor always with you.” This statement is not intended to mean that there must of necessity be poor people, and therefore it isn’t of much use to try to help them. Some appear to take that meaning out of Jesus’ words, thinking that the added statement “when ye will ye may do them good” also indicated that they might be neglected for the most part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And why should the spirit of generosity be limited to one day in the year? Why think of God’s great goodness merely once in the course of twelve months? The immoderate indulgence and the reckless spending, the senseless giving and the thoughtless receiving at Christmas-time are all a part of Satan’s method of stampeding people en masse into a course of action which really dishonors God. It is a substitution of “the spirit of Christmas” for the spirit of Christ.— Romans 8:9.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>The Birth of Jesus</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Beautiful indeed is the story of the birth of Christ, and far-reaching the great blessing which it brings to men. The song of the angels, upon the midnight clear, of “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, to men of goodwill,” resounds ever in the hearts of those who love God. And the associated memories which have been instilled along with the account of Jesus’ birth are also precious. They reveal, step by step, the grace and goodness of God. First, after many centuries of waiting, came the announcement to Mary the virgin of the fact that she was to be the mother of Messiah, the great King of Jehovah God, who was to “bless all the families of the earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Passing by the rich and great, the angel gave his message of coming joy to a humble maiden of Nazareth, poor and devout, who loved and served the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The account has deeply impressed itself upon the minds of men, who have sought to find in Mary herself that which would merit this great honor. Doubtless the humble maiden was approved of God, but no earthly goodness could make one of the imperfect human family “worthy” of such grace. This fact Mary fully appreciated, and she thought less of herself in this connection than of the fact that here was an occasion where she was to be used in the accomplishment of the divine purpose, and therefore she rejoiced, regarding not the possible reproach that might fall upon her because of the fact that she had no husband, although she was espoused, in the custom of those times, to.Joseph the carpenter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Unmindful of all else except the one great fact that she was being used of God for His own divine purpose of salvation and vindication, Mary left everything in the hands of God her Savior. She did not deduce her own virtues as the reason why God was pleased to select her for this most glorious favor. Rather she said, &quot;For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.'<sup>-</sup>’ Though of low estate Mary was a true handmaiden of the Lord, and because of her full and unquestioning devotion and submission to Jehovah He found in her “an instrument ready”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The story moves on in beautiful simplicity, all the more impressive and convincing in its lack of ostentation. The rich and great were not present, nor were any gifts brought to the new-born King. Humble shepherds were selected to be the witnesses of His nativity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But Satan, with malevolent intent, laid his plans to thwart the benign purposes of Jehovah. Drawing together unwitting and willing aids to carry out his plot, he worked upon the minds of certain magicians, and led them to conclude that a certain “star” they had seen indicated that a king was born somewhere, and they decided to curry favor by bringing him costly gifts. Some have thought the story of the “wise” men and their visit to Bethlehem (about two years after the birth of the Lord Jesus) to be one of the most strikingly beautiful of the incidents connected with the birth of Jesus. On the contrary, it was the most tragic, for it was the direct cause of the murder of all the innocent babes of that town. The “star” improperly called “the star of Bethlehem” led the magi straight to the worst enemy the new-born King could possibly have. Obviously a little reflection will show that it was Satan who engineered the whole matter.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Satan’s Methods</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">The visit of the magi with its ostentation contrasts sharply with the beauty of the events that had preceded it. The humble birthplace of the Lord, the singing of the heavenly hosts, the announcement to the unassuming shepherds, all show that no earthly display could add to the glory and the importance of the event. Human inventions could only obscure the significance as well as the true holiness of all that the occasion revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is it not like Satan to burden men with a multitude of vain observances and notions'? Trees, lights, tinsel, sweets, special foods, pictures, statues, festoons, holly, evergreens, jollity, yule logs, etc., etc., confuse and bewilder the mind. To many “Christmas” means no more than that, the outward show, the display, the pretense, the insincere giving and equally insincere receiving. The hurry, the worry, the hustle, the bustle, the rush and the crush arc all foreign to the event which the day is supposed to commemorate.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Jesus Not Born in December</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">But does Christmas really commemorate the birth of Jesus? It does not! And why'? Because Jesus was not born in December, and there is obviously no sense in celebrating a birthday at any other time than on its anniversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Christmas” really means “Christ-mass”, or “the mass of Christ”. It is a Roman Catholic term and gives us a clue to where the idea of “celebrating” “Christmas” really originated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That Jesus was not born on December 25 is now well known and generally admitted. The fact that the shepherds were in the fields, watching the sheep, the night Jesus was born, shows that it was not midwinter, which even in Palestine would be too cold to keep the flocks in the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus was born about October 1. Scriptural evidence shows that He was 331,- years old at the time of His death, about the end of March; hence He must have been 33 years old six months before that, about the end of September or beginning of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How, then, did it happen that Christmas is observed in supposed commemoration of the date of Jesus’ birth about three months later? It was all decided by the Roman pope Gregory in the fourth century. December 25 had long-been celebrated by various nations as the “feast of the sun” or as the birthday of one of their gods; so it was a simple matter to just change the name, and still let the people have what they wanted, a time of revelry and drunkenness. The Devil’s feast was given a “Christian” name.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>The Devil’s Feast?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">When God in Eden foretold that there would in due time be born a child who would bruise the serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15) it undoubtedly made a deep impression on Satan’s mind. He saw in this statement a prediction of his own undoing. “The seed of the woman” from that time on became the object of Satan’s wrath, and it is evident that he would be on the lookout for this “seed” or son of the woman in order that he might destroy the son before the son could destroy him. While he did not know who that seed would be, he would take no chances, and would destroy anyone who seemed likely to become Jehovah’s instrument or servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, he would advance anyone who willingly took a stand against Jehovah and try to get the people to follow such a one. Satan further foisted upon the people all kinds of misleading ideas, in order to obscure the real purpose of Jehovah. If he could not entirely blot out the remembrance of the promise that the seed of the woman would destroy the serpent (representing himself) he would try to mislead the people as to who and what the seed really was.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Nimrod and Semiramis</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">On the lookout for a suitable tool, Satan, not long after the flood, used Nimrod, whom he made “a mighty hunter before Jehovah”. Some have thought that this title indicates that Nimrod had Jehovah’s approval; but that could not be true. Jehovah did not approve the hunting of animals, though He permitted men to use certain animals for food. The wanton shedding of blood was prohibited by God’s everlasting covenant with mankind.—Genesis 10:9; 9:1-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has apparently been Satan’s policy to have men make use of the name of God while following a course directly contrary to His commands. Thus he has brought reproach upon God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While the Bible does not mention Nimrod’s mother, fairly authentic evidence shows that she was a wicked and ambitious woman who let nothing stand in her way to the attainment of power for herself and her son. Nimrod, who married his own mother, became the first king of Babylon. He was probably a leader in the effort to build the tower of Babel, contrary to God’s deflnite instructions.—Genesis 10:8-12; 11:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nimrod became exceedingly powerful, extending his kingdom in all directions. This much the Scriptures tell us. The remainder of the story is not so easily traced, but sufficient evidence remains in the mythology of various countries to enable students to piece together the fragments and see in dim outline what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The story is here given in brief. The clues are set forth at length in a book, called </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Btibylons,</span><span class="font11"> by Alexander Hislop. This book so thoroughly shows that the Catholic organization is the work of the Devil that it cannot be obtained in this country, where the Hierarchy has far too much power. It may, however, be had from the publishers, Partridge, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nimrod was slain, whether by the beasts which he hunted or by an enemy is not made clear. Semiramis, under the influence of Satan, then announced that her son and husband had been raised from the dead as a god, an invisible spirit. In this way she not only exalted her son in the minds of the people, but also herself, as his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">She advanced the idea that she was really the “woman” mentioned in the divine prophecy and that Nimrod was “the seed” who would destroy the serpent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This “mother and son” idea or doctrine runs through all the false religions of earth, and is no doubt a part of Satan’s scheme to get people to lose sight of the real “seed of the woman” which is Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An evergreen tree growing out of a dead stump was used as a symbol of Nimrod’s death and supposed resurrection. Semiramis claimed that this new tree grew up in one night, and by various other frauds increased her influence over the people. She called Nimrod the “father of the gods”, that is, the greatest of all “mighty ones”, and she herself was given the title “queen of heaven”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>&quot;The Branch”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">In the Bible Jesus is called “The Branch”. (Zechariah 3:8; 6:12; see the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation')</span><span class="font11"> Similarly, Nimrod was, by Satan’s manipulation, called “The Branch”. The evergreen tree which was said to represent him is the one in which the present-day Christmas tree has its origin. The “Nimrod tree” was supposed to be laden with gifts every year on the date of the so-called resurrection of Nimrod. Semiramis and others claimed that Nimrod was the great giver of gifts, and a great feast in commemoration of Nimrod was held at the time that is now observed as Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As time went on the story of Nimrod and Semiramis was told in different ways, and different names were given to the “mother and son” in various parts of the earth. In Egypt they became known as Isis and Osiris; in Assyria they were called Rhea and Nimis; in Greece they had Ceres and Dionysus, or Bacchus ; in India are found Isi and Iswara; in Asia they are known as Cybele and Deoius; in Pagan Rome, as Fortuna and the boy Jupiter. Even in far-away China the idea of “mother and son” is found in Shing Moo with a child in her arms. Nimrod also appears in some countries as Be-lus; in others, as Zoroaster and as Adonis. Away up north, in Sweden and Norway, before they heard of Jesus and Mary they had the mother-and-son combination. Numerous other names are used to designate these counterfeit “mother-and-son” goddesses and gods. But they all served the purpose of blinding the nations and keeping them in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In connection with the worship of these religions there were feasts and holidays upon which there were practiced all kinds of wicked rites. In addition there was drunkenness and debauchery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The chief feast occurred in the latter part of December or early in January and was celebrated especially in view of the fact that the sun from then on would increase in strength. The sun was worshiped by many as the “father of the gods”. He was called “Sol”. The old Roman feast of the birth of Sol was observed on the 25th of December.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Making Christians Out of the Heathens</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">When the Roman Catholic church sent out its missionaries to make Christians out of the heathen, it was not an easy matter. In various ways, sometimes by fighting them, they succeeded in making the change at least in name. Often the trick was turned by “converting the leader of a tribe” and then baptizing the whole bunch by having them pass a given point at which a priest waved over them a branch which was dipped in water. One little difficulty was that these newly-made converts were not willing to give up their feast, and especially the “sunfeast” they had so heartily enjoyed by plenty of drinking and carousing. “Mother church,” however, was equal to the situation. Simply call the beast by another name, and all was well. The feast of the sun had become the mass of Christ, “Christ Mass,” Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The name was changed, but the feast was not. They still brought in the tree in the same old way. Still the festoons were hung about the house to keep out “evil spirits”. The burning of the yule log was still thought to keep away bad luck. The Devil “laughed up his sleeve”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Santa Claus</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">And where, in all this, does Santa Claus, or St. Nick, come in? He is supposed to have been a “saint” who lived in the fourth century. He was a generous old codger, throwing bags of gold right and left. He is also the patron-saint of thieves and robbers! No wonder that St. Nick is confused with Old Nick, who is, of course, the Devil himself, and who gets plenty of satisfaction out of the popularity of his “saint” with so-called “Christian” people. In Europe the feast of “St. Nicholas” is observed on December 6, but in the United States he seems obligingly to have deferred the celebration until December 25, to add to the confusion, and to throw additional reproach upon the name of God and upon His dear Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Dutch, who settled New York, called </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">St. </span><span class="font11">Nicholas “Sinte Klaas”, and that seems to be the source of the papular “Santa Claus”. However, the Dutch or European St. Nicholas is always dressed as a bishop in ecclesiastical garments, just as the present-day bishops and cardinals are shown in the funny pictures which appear in the papers from time to time. Both the St. Nicholas and Christ Mass ideas are, of course, thoroughly Roman Catholic, and therefore entirely heathen, for the Catholics themselves admit that these practices were adopted from heathen religious worship. Cardinal Newman called them “the very instruments and appendages of demon worship”, and such they were and still are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Roman Catholic churches at Christmastime images depicting the babe Jesus are displayed and kissed by the “worshipers”. The result is that many Catholics pray to the babe Jesus, seemingly unaware that this is praying to something or someone who does not exist. The real Jesus, with all power in heaven and in earth, is obscured in their minds by the worship of “mother and son”, who are the most prominent characters in their theology, along with the figures of the crucified Jesus. Precious as the memory of the Savior’s birth, life and death may be to the Christian, they are all in the past, and He is now the Lord of Glory, Jehovah’s anointed and exalted King, who has come to establish His Kingdom to the vindication of Jehovah’s great name.</span></p>

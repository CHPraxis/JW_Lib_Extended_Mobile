Smith makes up her mind to clean house; she has 15,000 children; the house is large; it takes time to get over it; but she announces her plans and begins vigorously at the attic, working her way down. Her neighbor, Mrs. Brown, needs to clean her own house, but wants credit in the community for cleaning Mrs. Smith’s house, or having it cleaned, and so she runs up and down the sidewalk, dressed in her thinnest and most lovely pajamas, and shouts to all passersby how terribly filthy is the home of Mrs. Smith, and in the name of public decency and morals demands that something be done about it. Meantime Mrs. Smith is diligently minding her own business and working her way down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">She has 15,000 artists to keep in line; that is some job for any good housekeeper. But she was hard at her clean-up job when the Roman hierarchy heard about it and wanted credit for it, and got it, too, more’s the pity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1932, and perhaps earlier, the above-named organizations previewed American motion pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These previewers (censors) were untrammeled in judgment or expression. The American Motion Picture Producers modestly inquired in 1932: “What makers of what other product in the history of the world have invited disinterested outsiders to view their wares before the wares were offered on the market, and have encouraged the dissemination of advance criticism, however ruthless?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was not until 1934, two years later, that the storm of the Roman hierarchy broke on the Producers, and it broke then only because the hierarchy wanted to be the kite and wanted the other previewers to be the tail, which, as a matter of fact, is just what they immediately proceeded to become.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a closely typewritten 27-page review of its efforts to produce films suitable for the child mind the Producers mention that “in this one field contacts were established in 1933 with more than 10,000 additional community leaders, including 6,000 teachers, editors and club group leaders; 1,200 librarians ; 800 clergymen, directors of religious education, and Y.M.C.A. secretaries as well as 2,000 theater managers”. Quite a list, now, isn’t it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A year later the Producers said: “We are now carrying on active co-operation and tendering continuous facilities to more than 3,000 better film councils and other groups.” In other words, besides attending to their own business, which was considered a virtue 2,000 years ago (1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:11; 1 Peter 4:15), the Producers have been trying to satisfy a group of idlers and mischief-makers that the Mexicans have had to expel from their country before they could do anything worth while in an educational way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Producers intimate that they dimly sense that they have been captured and bound hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and foot by their natural enemies when they say that it may well be before long the Producers will be saying to Will Hays:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We have followed your leadership. We have tried to give these people what they want, but nothing will satisfy them; nothing will even mitigate their attacks. They are simply enemies of entertainment, and we cannot go along with groups who wish no end but our destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Producers are making the mistake of a lifetime. What they should do is to rip the mask off this whole system of hypocrisy, Catholic and Protestant, and show it up for just what it is, a method of keeping the people in bondage to fear and superstition, and with no more resemblance to Christianity of the Bible than a Galapagos Island turtle bears to a beautiful gazelle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether true Christianity can be popularized is another matter. But if it cannot, why pander to the frauds that are trying to live upon its reputation? It is entirely untrue that the Roman hierarchy represents any considerable following. Many Catholic people (but not all of them) bow to their will because they are afraid of their imagined power. In their hearts they hate them. Witness what is happening in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One visualizes a great octopus, defined in the dictionary thus: '(1) A devil fish having eight arms or tentacles, each with two rows of suckers. (2) Figuratively, any organized power regarded as of far-reaching capacity for harm.’ Quite an apt figure of speech, and agrees with the above quotation; don’t you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no one more adept at good words and fair speeches than the Roman Catholic system. Like Jezebel, she sits at her window, painted up and adorned for the passer-by to admire her. Why criticize her ? She wants to feel young and have a chance in the movies—she simply couldn’t keep her nose out of that—she is such a chaste lady herself, and simply must teach the world good morals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One is most surely interested in decency, by all means, but when a system representing onesixth of the population of America, twenty millions against one hundred millions, five-sixths of other faiths, says what one is to see on the screen, it is coming to a fine show. The twenty million, to be frank, represent about one-third minors, one-third Roman Catholic in name, and perhaps on a church roll, and the last third one might say active Catholics, moving like Punch and Judy by a string manipulated by the 'man in the box’. One might say, “The Roman Catholic church restricts only its own flock from seeing certain pictures, do they?” Let one turn his eyes to the moving picture industry. They have what they call </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;the index”;</span><span class="font6"> that is a list of books banned by the Roman Catholic system, and which influences producers considerably. Cannot they shake the fear of this system, seeing Roman Catholic active members are so limited in number, compared with citizens of the U.S.A, not Catholic, and indifferent to what Catholics think?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Strange, isn’t it, and sounds paradoxical, that the representatives of the system that criticizes the moving picture industry so severely, and had nothing good to say of the actresses thereof, and advises the people not to pour millions into their lap, should have such an awe-inspiring influence over the producer? Really it is surprising that producers are so fast asleep, and ask, Why let fear of Roman Catholic newspaper articles, and croakings of Roman Catholic cardinals and bishops, dictate and govern us in the production of plays ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Motion pictures are a means to impart instruction, and admittedly a power for good and evil. The truth portrayed in pictures is not always palatable to the Roman Catholic system; Jezebel’s interest in pictures is to keep under cover some of her own past indelicacies, that her present lovers may be kept in the dark. Take, for instance, the banning to Roman Catholics of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Affairs of Cellini.</span><span class="font6"> This was based on a document “The Autobiography of Benevenuto Cellini”. It related the marriages and lives of popes and their bastard sons in Italy a few centuries ago, written by a Roman Catholic at that. The document was lost for a very long time, but finally was found in a secondhand shop and translated into English. The book was too enlightening for the Catholic laity; so the hierarchy banned it. Of course, the immorality banned was Cellini’s, not the pope’s. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cherchez la femme,</span><span class="font6"> Revelation 17: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If producers continue to permit the Roman Catholic censorship to govern their productions, here is the pitfail for them. They unwittingly, no doubt, will withhold from the American people, and especially the youth of America, interesting historical facts in plays. Of late such pictures have produced instructive entertainment for the masses, and awakened an appreciation of better pictures for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A class of people that found no interest in plays of lighter vein are now attracted to pictures. However, if the producer is going to allow </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;the index”</span><span class="font6"> to bias him in production, this will be the result:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Boman Catholic system will censor any book, likely to be written up for production in scenario form, that will reveal her in her true colors. That is part of her business. It is appalling, the ignorance of Catholics on common history of the past centuries. A young man studying for the priesthood stated: “King Henry VIII translated [he said ‘wrote’] the Protestant Bible.” They are confident St. Peter was the first pope, and do not know there were no popes until the fourth century. Can you imagine the Roman Catholic system’s passing a scenario of the “Persecution of Arius”, who stood for the truth—God the Father, and Jesus the Son, and against the worship of the virgin Mary as though Mary was divine, and her offspring God himself?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or of the persecution by the Roman Catholics of Peter Waldo, who had the Gospels translated into French from Latin, and, finding they differed widely from the teachings of Roman Catholicism, began to let his light shine—alas for Peter Waldo ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or of the persecution of the faithful martyrs in Britain, under the reign of Bloody Mary, a Roman Catholic queen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then turn your eyes to France, Italy, Germany, and note the same wicked system persecuting faithful souls for their constancy to truth. To the excommunication of Archbishop Fenelon from church and court for his love of justice toward a suffering woman, Madame Guyon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They</span><span class="font6"> imprisoned her in the Bastille. Let us quote from one of her letters, written in the seventeenth century—it sounds so up-to-date— a letter to Pere la Chaise, confessor to Louis XIV: “They have not only shut me in prison, and attempted to blast my honor, but they have insisted that I have failed in respect for the doctrines of the church, and have denounced me as a heretic. Permit me to say in soliciting your kindness and protection that I ask nothing which shall be found inconsistent with justice and truth. The judge of the ecclesiastical court has been to my prison, and has examined the statements and papers laid before him against me, and has pronounced them false. Have I not reason then to think that it is something besides my alleged want of orthodoxy which keeps me in prison ?” Another letter from her: “It is true that my feeble nature has sometimes been greatly burdened. Sorrows have come in upon me like a flood; I have been obliged to say with the psalmist, ‘All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Years later, when banished to Blois, a broken invalid, she wrote the well-known hymn in which appears “While place I seek or place I shun”. Will the Roman Catholic system ever permit such enlightening historical facts to pass censorship if adapted to the screen? One thinks not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic church is a menace in its self-appointed censorship of the movingpicture industry. It is to be hoped that producers will awake and not withhold from the American people truths of history that will enlighten the masses, uncensored by a system that poses hypocritically to protect them from immorality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps no more fitting picture conies to mind than that of Abimelech, who slew all his father’s sons, save one, and made himself king. Jotham, who was spared, stood on the top of a hill and lifted up his voice. Read what he said [Judges 9:15-20]—it fits well today: “And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">if not,</span><span class="font6"> let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil is such a braggart that all one has to do is to wait and he always lets the cat out of the bag. In the Jesuit magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6"> the admission has just been made that the motion picture producers met with the Catholic bishops in May, 1934, at that time came under the code written by the church authorities and under their code interpreter, and since that time have acceded to his every order. It seems that the Jesuits forgot to tip off the Catholic “daughters” and they kept squawking about the indecent movies, whereas the bishops’ objective was already gained. The truth is that the bishops would never have started that campaign except to throw dust in the eyes of the two and one-half million people who signed the petition of Jehovah’s witnesses for fair treatment on the air. The unsophisticated would jump to the conclusion that the bishops are really interested in cleaning up the movies and that there must be some reason why they really wanted to get rid of Judge Rutherford. And there is. The real reason is that Judge Rutherford is telling the people the truth about their devilish organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS country began with a tree and a flintlock musket. The first settlers on these shores had to hide behind trees and shoot Indians. It was not a very difficult task to drive back the Indians, who were armed only with bows and arrows. The old blunderbusses loaded with gun-powder and slugs made noise enough to scare the red men even if they did not always score a perfect hit. As the Indians moved back the white men moved forward. This was confiscation in early history, and it worked perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Indians had been put on the run the Colonists thrived and prospered. The prosperity of these early settlers brought added taxation from the mother country, England. The natives paid taxes until they became so burdensome they could not possibly make enough money to meet these increased demands. There was nothing left for the Colonists to do but fight; and fight they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again it was a tree and a rifle. Instead of shooting red men, this time it was redcoats. The natives hid behind trees and took pot shots at English and Hessian soldiers. They knew their trees and their flintlock muskets, and in time ran out the redcoats as they had the red men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this country now their own the natives formed their own constitution for future government and started a republic that was destined to lead the world. The vast extent of territory, with its great abundance of natural resources, made this country the paradise of the world. It offered life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When the Americans subdued the red men and the redcoats the progress of this nation was sure and rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the Revolutionary War the exploitation of the people was in the hands of the royalists of Great Britain. It was not until big Americans sought to exploit the people that we began to see trouble again. It took a bigger war to stop the exploitation of the black people than it did to push the Indians off their own land. Even in the act of freeing the blacks new financial giants were produced whose wealth made it possible for them to own the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the emancipation of the slaves came the immigration of cheap labor. Shipload after shipload of immigrants were landed in this country. These newcomers were eager to get out of their country where the future offered them nothing more than the miseries of the past. They were grateful to work for little or nothing just to enjoy the personal liberties of this country. They worked hard and were thrifty. They asked nothing more than the privilege to work and earn. They knew well the hardships they had endured in their native countries, and could compare their past with their future. To these immigrants America was heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rapid breeding among the immigrants brought forth a new situation. Their children had never known the hardships of their parents in their native lands. As the children grew to the age where they could breed and bring forth more and more children, the situation became more and more acute. The rapidly increasing population, with no added land areas and the diminishing of the natural resources, soon made making a living more difficult as time went on. Life now became a matter of the survival of the fittest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With more people being born than could be absorbed in gainful occupation there came the labor leaders who sought to live well from the efforts of the actual workers. These leaders formed their armies of dues payers and were soon ready to carry rifles and look for trees. This was the beginning of the wars between labor and capital. Capital retaliated with laborsaving inventions. Steam shovels replaced hundreds of human diggers. Elevators threw thousands of hodcarriers and ladders out of use. Gasoline engines and electricity took the place of labor, with the laboring classes breeding as rapidly as ever. It was just the beginning of the wealthy becoming wealthier and the poor becoming poorer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the very start of the American nation the people had been divided into three parts: the wealthy class, which controlled the currency; the middle class, which furnished the brains; and the lower class, all the hard work. All during this set-up the middle class was the buffer between the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor. As long as such a situation existed the wealthy actually had little or nothing to worry them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Along came the World War at a time when such a war was considered necessary to kill off a percentage of the already too large population in all countries. Progress in the science of medicine had made plagues and epidemics impos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sible as a means to accomplish this. Here was a grand opportunity for the wealthy to become far more so. The powerful Americans sold their people into war to increase their power. The outcome of the World War was to find America actually stuck for the major portion of the expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War was followed by the most disastrous effect in American history. It was the beginning of the annihilation of the middle class in America. People of the middle class were urged to purchase securities in American industries. The urge for gambling was built up in the only legalized gambling game in the nation. They w<sup>r</sup>ere urged to purchase homes under the guise that home owners made the best citizens. They were urged to purchase everything on the installment plan, from homes to automobiles and from real estate to stocks on margin. This created a fool’s paradise that could last only as long as the extremely wealthy would permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the days of automobiles a man could buy a horse for one hundred dollars. The horse would earn its keep and make money for its owner and five years afterwards could be resold for one hundred dollars. Later on a man paid three thousand dollars for an automobile and five years afterwards was glad to get fifty dollars for the out-of-date, secondhand contraption. There are some people owning automobiles today who have neither the money nor the brains to operate a wheelbarrow. There are people owning automobiles who have not the price to purchase a collar and necktie. There are those who are depriving themselves of the actual necessities of life in order to loaf around in an automobile. It would be doing humanity a favor if the government were to put a tax of ten cents a gallon on gasoline. This would do much to bring back the horse and the bicycle. Automobiles and installment buying have put the public in hock for many years to come. Those now in hock are living at the expense of those who endeavored to save for a rainy day. It will not be long before no taxpayer has even an umbrella left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then came the elimination of the middle class. The Stock Market took a well-timed toboggan slide with such stock as that of the New York Central railroad falling from two hundred and fifty dollars to nine dollars per share. The currency paid by the middle class went into hiding, leaving the victims holding counties's batches of worthless securities. Then came the confiscation of their homes for back taxes and unpaid interest. Installment payments could no longer be met, and away went all those unpaid luxuries. The extermination of the buffer class between the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor was now complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was an absolute victory for the wealthy. They now owned practically everything from the government to all the tall buildings. They had won decisively and had nothing at all to worry them. Millionaires were now billionaires, and if anybody needed money it would have to come from them. They had cornered the money market to such an extent that even if the government needed money it would have to borrow from them and pay them interest. The battle was over, and the people were again slaves; just as much slaves as were the Negroes before the Civil War, when they worked for their keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, with their victory for wealth came unforeseen worries. Starving people were dangerous to contemplate, so they were fed through fear, and not through charity. Their food must be paid for, and the money must come from added taxes. High taxes must naturally come from those who had hidden the currency. Wealthy men, like Andrew W. Mellon, began to engage clever lawyers to protect what they had hidden. With the middle class, or the buffer class, wiped out, the extremely wealthy were left at the mercy of an augmented lower class. This was a terrible situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many European countries, since the World War ruined them, had overthrown their governments and now dictators were in power. Kings, emperors and monarchs had been dethroned and Napoleons of the present day were in power. The financiers w’ere now face to face with troubles to which they had never before given thought. All their schemes had gone screwy. They outnumbered everybody in wealth, but they did not outnumber the people. The people must be fed or all their wealth would be in serious jeopardy. Taxes were now chasing them to their hiding places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The financiers sought through the power of their wealth to buy up the lawmakers and have them put into law codes and regulations that would protect them from the wrath of the people. They endeavored to throw the country into war, which would silence the people and the press, but the people had not forgotten the World War. With so much frightened currency in hiding, the government was forced to issue new money in order to feed the people. This quite naturally made the hidden money less valuable. It was a state of affairs never thought possible by those who had planned the downfall of the middle class. Many of the great financiers were now in the same fix as a billionaire on a barren island who would gladly exchange a thousand-dollar bill for a ham sandwich to sustain life. Things had not worked out as they had been planned. They saw what they had taken from others being taken from them through higher taxes, as a highwayman would take it with a gun. They saw the government vote five billion dollars in one lump sum to be used as financial water to prime a pump gone dry. They know if the five billion dollars does not set financial water flowing again another and perhaps still another five billion dollars must be produced by added taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the meantime the lower class has been reduced to living on dole. Members of the middle class have lost their investments, their homes and their all, and have no purchasing power left. The middle class is falling back into the lower class, making the largest army of unemployed the financial directors of this nation have ever had to face. This army will increase as it breeds. Idleness breeds crime which will attack those believed still to possess wealth. It was much easier and much quicker to tear down America than it will be to rebuild it. Greed has conquered, but at what a cost to humanity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Homes in the hands of bankers are not where they belong. Currency hidden is just as much unemployed as the people out of work. Keeping people alive by taxing those who still have some money left can last only as long as taxes can be paid. When all is taken and there is nothing left, what then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This country began with a tree and a musket when the white man fought the red man for what he owned. Our nation began with a tree and a musket when the Colonists fought the redcoats for what they governed. We may again resort to a tree and a rifle to fight the yellow man. It may be the yellow men in our own race or it may be the yellow race. As an individual makes his bed, so must he lie in it; and as a nation makes its bed, so must it lie out of it or fight. Whether we live to fight or fight to live may soon be settled in a manner that will call for the reprinting of all the histories in American schools.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ Our president of the United States, the knight of the Nourmahal, says we are confused because we cannot see just how this thing is going to look when he gets through making it. Why, to be sure! All those millions of hogs they killed; all those cattle they shot down; the milk they poured into the rivers, with the people starving for it; all of the cotton they plowed under and wool that they burned up, with the people naked because they could not get it; none of us can just see how that is working out. But the president says it is going to look pretty when he gets the picture made up. Surely it will look pretty. It may not look exactly like a song, but it will be something like a dance, the St. Vitus’ Dance. Now the president said this: ‘ They know that the process of the constructive rebuilding of America cannot be done in a day or a year.’ No, and if he is a fair sample of it, they know it cannot be done in a hundred years. His process of construction, if you call it construction, is to start out repairing the automobile by first tearing off the top and then, when the rain begins to beat in, to hammer the engine to pieces, tear down the chassis, and then wind up by taking off the wheels. That leaves only one thing to do,—he sends the bill for the work. That bill has now reached the size of over thirty billions of dollars, six times more than all of the monej- in circulation in the United States.”</span></p>

Another indictment was “taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our government”. What has this to do with the oft-repeated claims of Catholics that Jeffersonian democracy has been destroyed and America is in full tilt to be guided from Rome? Not a thing. If a person prefers to go to sleep in the presence of pickpockets, and only gets angry when his attention is called to the fact that somebody is making off with all his trousers except the suspender buttons, why irritate him?

Senators and congressmen had about as many opportunities. Apparently the clergy have not felt called upon to bring any pressure on the National Broadcasting Company to restrain freedom of speech by those to whom the National Broadcasting Company looks for renewals of licenses. And to a true American, with still a spark of manliness or honesty in his make-up, it does seem strange that the concern that virtually monopolizes the radio privileges of America could be so ready to help advertise one of the greatest governmental failures in history and yet not allow an able, thoughtful, reverent presentation of the only way out of the tangle, even when it is paid for. Free speech in America has become a joke, and the National Broadcasting Company is the principal offender. The NBC seems to take the attitude that the level of the intelligence of the American people is fully reached when they are fed pabulum by the party in power in respect to how all may get wealthy by killing unborn pigs, plowing under cotton, and otherwise destroying God’s bounties, and a sufficient amount of jazz, tooth paste, mouth wash and laxatives are administered along with it to make it seem like entertainment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Clergy Oppose Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE church organizations, both Catholic and Protestant, are ruled by priests or pastors, otherwise called “clergymen”, and these violently oppose the message of the Bible which Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying to the people. The clergymen claim to represent God and Christ, and Jehovah’s witnesses claim that they serve God and Christ, then why should the clergy oppose the message Jehovah’s witnesses bring? The correct answer is given in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was on earth the priests or clergymen of that day claimed to represent God and to be guides of the people. Jesus spoke the truth at all times, and yet those priests or clergymen violently opposed Him. They misled multitudes of people and caused them to oppose Jesus and His work. Jesus told those clergymen that they were blind guides and w<sup>T</sup>ere leading the people into blindness. (Matthew 15:12,14) Those clergymen exalted themselves; and the Devil, taking advantage of that fact, blinded them to the truth. To them Jesus said (John 8:38-45): Why do you not understand my speech? Because ye are of your father the Devil, and the desire of the Devil you do; and because I tell you the truth you believe me not, but seek to kill me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Exactly a similar condition exists today. When men use the Word of God for a selfish purpose to exalt themselves and other men they always fall into the trap of the Devil. Today the clergymen do not seek to exalt the name of Jehovah and His kingdom, but violently oppose it. Says the scripture at Romans 6: 'A man is the servant of him whom he serves.’ Since the clergymen oppose the message of God’s Word, they show themselves as servants of the Devil whether they appreciate that fact or not. The clergy are part of this world, participating in the politics of the world, and hence are blind to the truth and are the enemies of God. (James 4: 3,4) Every man who has faithfully followed Christ Jesus the religious organizations have opposed. To His followers Jesus says, in John 15: ^Because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. They have persecuted me, and they will persecute you also.’ That is the reason why the clergy oppose Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now clergymen advocate the League of Nations as a means of uplift for the people. They are ignorant of the Word of God, which says (Matthew 12: 21): Tn the kingdom of Christ is the hope of the world.’ If the clergymen represented God and His kingdom they would devote themselves exclusively to aiding the people to understand the Bible concerning the same. The fact that they ignore God’s kingdom and advocate schemes of men is conclusive proof that they serve the god of this world, who is the Devil. The clergy do not oppose Jehovah’s witnesses because they are afraid of them, but oppose them because they are afraid of the truth which Jehovah’s witnesses bring to the attention of the people. The truth will set the people free from the domination of selfish men and organizations. Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with men, clergymen or otherwise. Their only duty is to call the peoples’ attention to the truth of God’s Word so that each person may be free to intelligently take the course he desires. Everyone must take his stand on the side of God or of the Devil, because the time has come for the setting up of God’s kingdom of righteousness which shall rule the world. Those who remain on the Devil’s side will be destroyed. Those who take the side of God and His kingdom and obey shall live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful apostles of Jesus were going about the country teaching the people the truth of God’s Word, and the priests, or clergymen, caused those apostles to be arrested and thrown into prison. Those clergymen could not have been serving God and at the same time persecuting the faithful apostles of the Lord. Whom, then, did those priests, or clergymen, represent? They represented God’s adversary the Devil, because, according to the words of Jesus, they were doing the will of the Devil. God’s expressed purpose is that He will establish a righteous government under Christ, destroy Satan’s organization, and then bless the people. Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">commands His witnesses to now tell the people agents hate them and persecute them in order to this great truth; therefore the Devil and his prevent the people from hearing the truth.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Songs of Degrees</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font6">EVERAL Psalms are called Songs of Degrees. These are not what might be called religious degrees. Some religious degrees are scriptural. Thus the degree D.D. is scriptural (Isaiah 56:10), and usually awarded openly and with much ceremony. The V.D.M. and B.D. degrees have been awarded. B.D. may mean either Bachelor of Divinity or Bad Dog, or both. At the moment the Scriptural basis for either of these degrees does not appear. Examining the 120th and 124th Psalms, which are entitled Songs of Degrees, one notices that there may be some reference here, perhaps, to persons entitled to religious degrees who have been instrumental in assisting some of God’s people to free board behind bars. Thinking on this, and especially on 2 Thessalonians 2:12 and Hebrews 12: 8, a new degree, the degree of B.D. is now awarded to all such. Thus one might be either a D.D. or a B.D. and at the same time a D.B., or he could have the latter degree and not have either of the two first named, but the degree of D.B. is conferred only privately and after much careful study.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Improving Passaic’s Police</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">LL of Passaic (N. J.) police are now under orders that once a week they must go to some place where they will learn that God meant all right but has got the earth in such a terrible jam that only the preachers can straighten it out, or else that he is in a contest with the Devil which will result in the everlasting torture of almost everybody, or else that he is in partnership with the Devil, which latter gent holds most of humanity in a bake oven for 1,000 years after they get through with the priests, preachers, politicians, bankers and saber rattlers here below. In the latter case he can be bribed to cut down the time some. Quotations on time off, so much for so much, can be had from any “purgatory” expert. When the Passaic police get through with this course of instruction, they will be what they are now, subservient to the Roman hierarchy, only more so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man who gave the order that the Passaic (N. J.) police must go to church, director of public safety, John J. Roegner, is a Catholic. As a Catholic John is certainly not interested in the “heretical sects” of Protestantism, nor has he any interest in the Jews whom the Catholic organization so mercilously persecuted when it had the power to do so. His only interest is in getting the Catholic police (who haven’t a whole lot of use for the priesthood) to go to church and continue subject a little longer to priestly influence. As a large proportion of the police force in American cities is Catholic, the objective of the hierarchy is attained, though for the sake of covering its tracks it has this puppet tell Protestants to go to Protestant churches and the Jews to the synagogues. It cannot get tilings done the way it could at one time, so this concession has to be made. But what about those who are neither Jews, Protestants nor Catholics ? These seem to be out of luck; or are they in luck?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is something queer about this whole proposition, especially when it is remembered that most criminals had “religious” training of one kind or another. There may be foul play in this suggestion or order that police must go to church. It is hard to make out. It may be that the presence of the police in church will tend to hold in check those of criminal tendencies, seeing that the priests and preachers have not accomplished much in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The police will probably find a way out of the difficulty, however. Now that most preachers advertise their sermon (?) topics, it will be an easy matter to find out from the “Go to Church” page in the paper whether Dr. Musty is speaking on “Mother Goose” or “Alice in Wonderland”, or just what Rev. Makempay will say about the political situation. When it comes to this the Protestants have the edge on the Catholic police, for it seems that the priests &quot;take no thought for the morrow’ when it comes to telling in advance what they will preach about. On the other hand, the priests are not unreasonable, and a slight (?) monetary consideration will probably persuade them to divulge what they expect to talk about at the preaching mass. Since the police are also required to smile when on duty, the effect of the regulation will probably be to make bigger and better hypocrites, and more of them, all around.</span></p>

The remarkable parallel between the principles regarding social reconstruction enunciated by the popes and the efforts at national recovery-launched under the Christian leadership of President Roosevelt is an earnest that social justice as preached by the sovereign pontiffs can be the ultimate economic salvation of America if Catholic Action will express itself in united prayerful co-operation with honest elected leadership and not in the hopeless program, however sincere, of emotional mobocracy.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Already the duly authorized government at Washington shows a tendency to yield to fear of the sinister power of this priest. Before an audience of 25,000 people at Cleveland, enthusiastically ready to follow him, he cried, ‘We are stronger than any president.’ Orderly democratic government and our honored American institutions threaten to give way against this man who, half mad with lust for power, has deluded thousands of otherwise sensible citizens by his bizarre demagogy. Is there no way of stopping this wild priest? Are we, as Americans, content to have him dictate to the democratically chosen representatives of the people, and to the president himself, his own ideas which he hands down as though they were the dicta of God? Even the press seems to be afraid of him.’’</span></p>

Of course, it is all just an accident, the year before a presidential election, that a Roman Catholic party is forming right under America’s nose, and that those that are forming it had no intention to do what they are doing, and don’t intend to do anything whatever with the 8,750,000 (more or less) tied to Mr. Coughlin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">T first “Reverend” Coughlin was for Hoover;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">then it was “Roosevelt or Ruin”. Linking himself with the institution of which he is a part, he has said, “The Catholic church stands four-square behind the capitalists.” Of course it does, and this automatically estops it from claiming to be the friend of the workingman. Whenever this man has expressed himself as in favor of “a just and living annual wage” it has been noted that he is silent as to how to get it. Every statement seems to have a “but” attached to it. In one breath he says that “in this struggle for the recognition of labor unions the laborer is absolutely on the side of the angels”, yet when he built his new church he refused to have anything to do with union labor, and the wages he paid were 25 percent to 40 percent below trade union rates. He urged workers to fight for their rights, but not to strike. He wants a Fascist solution of the labor problem. He condemned Milwaukee students for adopting antiwar resolutions. He is for huge military appropriations, wanting 10,000 airplanes to guard the coast line. He is for war in Mexico. He is against what he calls “bonds, bloody bonds”, but on March 19, 1931, invested $80,048.04 in government bonds. In denouncing the great financiers he never mentions either Rockefeller or Hearst. He is in close touch with some of the greatest financiers in New York. It is figured that his expenditures are about $1,250,000 per year, and the income about $450,000. It is conjectured that the missing $800,000 is put up by those who are determined to have a Fascist dictatorship in America. He has denounced profits of 35 or 40 percent, but on the $20,000 invested in silver margins he is calculated to have made a profit of $120,000, which is 600 percent. He has three bank accounts, one in the name of C. E. Coughlin, one in the name of the Radio League of the Little Flower, and a third in the name of St. Therese of the Child Jesus Parish. All three accounts are used for speculative purposes. He is a Jew-baiter. He is not in favor of free speech. He is an ideal tool for some man who would be Fascist dictator.

Coughlin himself does the discussing and the electing.

<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the most interesting phenomena of the times is the betrayal of the people by the newspapers. Despite the certain knowledge that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is the world's greatest foe of human liberty, not a chance is let slip to pose that same hierarchy before the people as the grandest, most sublime institution on earth. The pettiness is astounding. Thus, when the big news came of the arrest of M. C. Harbeck, July 18, by the secret police of Germany it was concealed from the people that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and though it was grudgingly admitted that he is a prominent “Protestant minister”, the whole story in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Journal,</span><span class="font6"> in which the account first appeared, was put under glaring headlines about the “persecutions” of Catholics in Germany, which persecutions are almost if not entirely camouflage. The next morning, in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font6"> the same item appeared under glaring headlines “Hitler Orders Police Drive on Catholics”, but it was sandwiched in the middle of the article between two imaginary “reports” of contemplated action against Catholics. The effect upon the casual reader would be that the arrest of Harbeck was in some way an attack on the Catholics who were thereby being persecuted. Few would believe that anybody could be so fiendishly small of soul, yet the charge is openly made in New Jersey that both of these papers, and most other New York and New Jersey papers, are completely under the control of Frank Hague, the Roman Catholic boss of Jersey City, and that all the news from the state is colored to suit his wishes. That, most certainly, is the reason that no mention is ever made in the metropolitan papers of the maltreatment of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey. In other words, the public press of today is definitely on the side of the Devil and committed to him, body and soul, to do his will. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> had a decent and honorable report of Harbeck’s arrest; so also the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram;</span><span class="font6"> but in both the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> the camouflage was complete. Probably the fact is that Gog, the invisible prime minister of the Devil, caused the report of prospective attacks upon the Catholics to be circulated so that when he had nabbed Harbeck those who are given over wholly to the Devil might do just what the editors of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> did.</span></p>

(Genesis 9:1-17) These cities of refuge foreshadowed God’s loving-kindness for the protection of the people of good will during the coming battle of Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” (Revelation 16:13-16) The people of good will, now known as “Jonadabs” because of their likeness to Jonadab of old (2 Kings 10:15-23), must perform certain specific requirements in order to be assured of refuge during the trouble, and to ultimately receive life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [river] at Jericho, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly [through error (margin)] may flee thither.” (Numbers 35:1,10,11, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font6"> Deuteronomy 19:1-10) Three of the cities of refuge were on the east side of the Jordan, and three on the west side, in the land of Canaan, according to the commandments of Jehovah.—Numbers 35: 13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moses here was a type of Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses. (Acts 3:21-23) The setting up of the cities of refuge was notice to those who should have need therefor that God had made provision for their protection and refuge in time of distress. That was a part of the prophecy, and, being a prophecy, it must have its fulfillment at some later day and at the second coming of the Greater Moses. In keeping with the prophecy, on the 24th day of February, A.D. 1918, by the Lord’s grace and manifestly by His providence and direction, there was publicly delivered, at Los Angeles, Calif., for the first time the message “The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Thereafter that message was proclaimed by word of mouth and by printed publication throughout “Christendom”. No one of God’s people understood fully the matter at that time; but now in the clearer light of prophecy it is seen and understood that those on the earth who may live and not die are the ones who now ‘get into the Lord’s chariot’, as Jonadab at the invitation of King Jehu got into the chariot of Jehu and rode with him to the execution of Jehovah’s judgments upon the enemies in vindication of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s commandment was that there should be given to the tribe of the Levites fortyeight cities and suburbs. Out of these there were designated six cities for a place of refuge. (Numbers 35:6) These six were, in being thus assigned to the Levites, assigned to those who had been redeemed or purchased by Jehovah God in the place of the firstborn ones of the nation of Israel that had been spared of the Lord in the tenth and last plague which Jehovah brought upon Egypt to force it to let the Israelites go. These Levites had been assigned exclusively to God’s service. (Numbers 3:11-51) Now, in the Scriptures a city is a symbol of an organization; and the six cities thus appointed picture the organization of Jehovah’s consecrated ones yet on earth who are anointed with His spirit as His witnesses. Such anointed ones represent Zion, “the holy city,” or God’s capital organization, since it has been builded up. (Psalm 102:16) There being six such cities of refuge would not indicate an imperfect refuge, but rather would suggest that such is God’s provision for refuge while imperfect conditions still exist on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hebrew word for “refuge”, which is applied only to these six cities, means an “asylum”, as a receptacle into which something might </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">taken for protection and safe-keeping. If Jehovah would make such provision for one who slew another unawares, and who would therefore be helpless against the avenger or executioner, it would certainly seem reasonable that He would provide a similar place of protection for those people on earth who are of good will to be preserved from the “sword” of the great Executioner Christ Jesus which will avenge the world-wide violation of the everlasting covenant, this covenant pertaining to the sacredness of human life. All the nations have violated the everlasting covenant. For this reason God will execute His vengeance upon them at the battle of Armageddon. That is the day of the expression of the vengeance of our God. (Isaiah 61: 2; 63:4) In the cities of refuge the fugitive could be hid. Even so in the day of the execution of Jehovah’s vengeance He has provided a place of refuge where certain ones may be hid who learn the truth and w<sup>r</sup>ho do that which is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only one city of the priests of Israel was made a city of refuge, namely, Hebron, in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">hill country of Judea. (Joshua 21:11-13) The priests were taken from the tribe of Levi, and six cities of that tribe being made places of refuge, the manslayer seeking refuge was obliged to find protection in those cities. Hence these cities of protection symbolized the present-day organization of those who are wholly devoted to God and His spiritual temple service. There was, back there, no other place that the manslayer could find refuge or safety. This is strong proof that the Jonadab class of the present time who seek refuge against the day of vengeance must find it only in the Greater Jehu’s chariot, that is to say, in the organization of Jehovah. Of that organization Christ Jesus is the Head and great High Priest, and Jehovah’s witnesses today are also members thereof with Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark244"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>“Unawares”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">“These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them; that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.” (Numbers 35:15) What is meant by the words “every one that killeth any person </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">unawares”?</span><span class="font6"> This: Satan’s organization on the earth has willfully and deliberately broken God’s everlasting covenant by wantonly and cruelly killing human creatures. By His prophet God declares His purpose to destroy Satan’s official organization on the earth because of the violation of the everlasting covenant. (Isaiah 24: 5, 6) The commercial and political elements of Satan’s visible organization have deliberately planned and promoted cruel wars resulting in the wholesale shedding of innocent human blood. The religious element of “Christendom”, and particularly those of the clergy, have sanctified those wars and blasphemously declared them to be in harmony with God’s will. All such willful slayers shall perish at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand there are those on the earth, and particularly in the realm of “Christendom”, who have worked for and supported the commercial and political systems of oppression ; who have served in the armies and navies and taken human life; who have upheld the commercial and political systems that have greatly oppressed the people; who have been associated with religious systems which have sanctified war and have hence been a party to the crime of breaking the everlasting covenant; or who as members of the “strong-arm squad” have aided in the persecution of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus and have persecuted those who serve Jehovah God. During the World War many men participated in these wrongful doings, and especially in the persecution of God’s people (Matthew 24: 7-9), and did so without malice and without knowledge that they were violating God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple spiritual (in A.D. 1918, as fact and Scripture show) there has been great persecution heaped upon God’s people in the land of “Christendom”. There is bloodguiltiness on the part of those who have shared in this wrongful persecution deliberately. Others have had part therein unwittingly. “Christendom,” and particularly the official part thereof, lays great claim to doing God’s will, while at the same time being guilty of many flagrant crimes. The clergy, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy in particular, have connived with the big commercial and political wrongdoers in robbing and destroying the people, and the prophecy of Isaiah 1: 21-24 applies to them, because such are the ones who claim to be God’s kingdom. Among both the Jews and “Christendom” there have been those who have had no sympathy with such wrongdoing, yet by reason of circumstances have been forced into participating with and supporting these wrongdoers, to some degree at least, and are thus of the class that unwittingly are guilty of shedding blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who have unwittingly or unawares supported those wrongdoers must have some way of escape; otherwise they would fall in the great trouble in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. In His loving-kindness Jehovah has made just such a provision as is needed for their escape, and the cities of refuge pictured that way of escape. Of the six cities of refuge “Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising” (Deuteronomy 4: 41-44) After him Joshua confirmed that selection after he had crossed the Jordan, and also appointed three cities in Canaan. The six cities were a place of refuge for the children of Israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner, thus showing that in the fulfillment of the prophecy the place of refuge would be for those </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> “Christendom”, and also for those associated with “Christendom” but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font6"> a part thereof, who might have need of such refuge and who desire and seek it. —Joshua 20:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If death resulted from a willful act, as by one using as a weapon an instrument of iron, or by throwing a stone, or with the hand-weapon of wood, that is, a club, the one doing the wrongful act which thus resulted was guilty of murder and must die. (Numbers 35:16-18) The murderer’s blood must be shed by the avenger or revenger of blood, that being the law of God for punishment in violation of the everlasting covenant : “Whosoever sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.” (Genesis 9:6) “The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.” (Numbers 35:19) But if the killing was by accident or unawares, the manslayer might flee to the city of refuge for protection. “And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.”—Num. 35:12.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark246"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>The Avenger</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Who is “the avenger”, or the one who executes vengeance antitypically upon such wrongdoers? The very language of the law of God makes “the avenger” God’s official executioner. According to the Hebrew for “avenger”, the execution of vengeance devolved upon one by reason of kinship, family relationship, such as the relationship of the man Boaz toward Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth. (Ruth 2:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin; </span><span class="font6">3:2) The great kinsman of the human race by birth is Jesus, being born of Mary the virgin. Hence He was the near kinsman of the Israelites. (Galatians 4:4, 5) The perfect man Jesus bought the human race with His own precious blood and is therefore the Redeemer. As the Redeemer of man He is clothed with authority from Jehovah His Father to give life to the human race. (Romans 6:23; Isaiah 9: 6,7) He is Jehovah’s great official executioner and delivers justice by repaying like with like upon the blood-guilty. “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.” (John 5: 22, 27; Deuteronomy 19: 21) Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and the executioner of all of God’s enemies. In this execution of vengeance He associates with Him those pictured in the ninth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy as the “six men” each of which was armed with a slaughter weapon in his hand and used it under the direction of the Lord. The “six men” represent all of the invisible organization under Christ, including the resurrected members of “his body, the church”, also cherubim, seraphim, and angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him.” (Numbers 35:19) Jesus Christ, the great Executioner, will certainly meet or overtake all of the bloodguilty ones at Armageddon in the battle of the great day of God Almighty and will slay all such as are not in the cities of refuge. The provision of God’s law was, “that the [unwitting] manslayer [might flee to the city of refuge and thus] die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.” (Numbers 35:12) All other manslayers must be executed. The cities of refuge were prepared as a way of escape: “Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him [the slain one] not in time past. That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.” (Deuteronomy 19: 6,10) That provision of God’s law foreshadowed far greater things to come to pass after the faithful witnesses of Jehovah on earth have by Him been taken into His covenant for the kingdom of heaven and have been sent forth to ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come’. (Matthew 24:14) This preaching is now being done!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who, then, are the ones that will escape? It is the people of good will that flee into the “city of refuge”. These were once associated in some respect with Satan’s organization; but now, by reason of the wickedness thereof and by reason of God’s loving-kindness, they seek refuge in God’s organization, which organization was of old pictured by the cities of refuge. They forsake “Babylon”, that is, Satan’s organization, and flee unto God’s organization, taking their stand on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom. Henceforth they must have no sympathy with nor give support to the wicked organization, but must remain steadfastly on the Lord’s side and be in full sympathy with His organization and the work He is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great Judge, Christ Jesus, is upon His throne at the temple and is dividing the people as an oriental shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. (Matthew 25:31-46) Those who desire to be in harmony with God and righteousness must without equivocation or compromise take their stand on Jehovah’s side and let it be known that they are for God and His righteous government at all times. The obligation is now upon Jehovah’s witnesses to instruct the Jona-dab class in order that those of good will may act intelligently. Those persons of good will and honest heart have been kept in blindness by Satan and his agents, particularly the clergy, until they heard the truth about the Lord and His kingdom, and thus they have unwittingly supported the unholy crowd and committed acts of violence to those who are devoted to Jehovah and His kingdom, as well as to others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>Seeking Refuge</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">God’s law required that if one committed manslaughter accidentally or unawares or unwittingly and he was not an enemy of the slain person, “then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments: and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.” (Numbers 35:22-25) The congregation must try the case and determine whether or not the slayer might flee to their city and find refuge there. “And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.” —Joshua 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the decision was that the slaying was without malice and was accidental or unwittingly committed, then the slayer should find protection in the city of refuge and must remain there until the death of Israel’s high priest. Then though the congregation found the slayer not guilty, and entitled to the protection of the city of refuge, that was not sufficient for him to go free, but he must go into the city of refuge and remain there until a change took place in the office of the high priest. At the death of the high priest the slayer might return with safety to his own place or residence. This would clearly seem to teach that the Jonadab class, having sought and found refuge with God’s organization, must remain therein, in the “chariot” with the Greater Jehu, and must continue in heart sympathy and harmony with the Lord and His organization and must prove this proper heart condition by co-operating with Jehovah’s witnesses until the office of the high priest class, the anointed ones under the Head Christ Jesus, yet on the earth be finished. Thus the people of good will must do if they would have their lives spared during the battle of the great day of God Almighty and be of the “millions now living (that) will never die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus Christ is the great High Priest, and the faithful members of His Father’s royal house, Jesus’ faithful footstep followers, are counted in as members of His priesthood. (Revelation 1:6; 20:6; 1 Peter 2:5-9) The anointing oil of God’s spirit has been specially poured out on all of Jehovah’s true witnesses in these latter days; and the faithful remnant thereof being thus anointed, they are made members of the “royal priesthood”. The Jonadab class must be obedient to Jehovah’s requirements. They must be submissive to God’s arrangement by honestly abiding in and supporting His organization until the end of the earthly ministry of the priesthood. Then Christ will no more act as a sacrificing priest, but as the great priest ministering life to the obedient ones of the world. This cannot take place until the day of Jehovah’s vengeance is past. The work of the “royal priesthood”, “after the order of Mel-chizedek” (Psalm 110:4), is a work of giving life to those who obey Him, Christ Jesus. Then will be the fulfillment of the words of Jesus, the great Life-giver, to wit: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” (John 8:51) “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”— John 11: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s law concerning the manslayer who did such slaying unwittingly provided for his protection only within the bounds of the city of refuge. The bounds or borders of the city were the suburbs which surrounded the city. If the avenger of blood should find the slayer out of the bounds of the city of refuge, then he could slay him with impunity and the avenger would be entirely free from wrongdoing. As written: “If the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he [the revenger] shall not be guilty of blood.”—Numbers 35: 2-5, 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophetic provision finds its fulfillment in the present day. Jehovah has graciously provided for those of good will who now seek Him, and who are not of the spiritual class or Jehovah’s witnesses. If after receiving these good things from the Lord’s hand any man is found exercising too much personal liberty, that is to say, not keeping within the bounds of Jehovah’s merciful provision made for him at the present time; if he does not take into consideration that he does not yet possess the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font6"> to life, but treats the favor of Jehovah lightly, indifferently, or ignores it, he loses the protection which Jehovah has provided for him. He must continue to appreciate the certainty and nearness of Armageddon, at which time Satan’s organization will be destroyed, and also the fact that soon the priestly company shall pass from the earth, and that then the Jonadab class may receive the gift of life through Jesus Christ if they continue steadfast on the side of the Lord and righteousness. Having once taken his stand on the Lord’s side and tasted the good things of God’s arrangement, and learning of God’s gracious provision for those of the Jonadab class, he cannot again turn to the “beggarly elements” of Satan’s organization and at the same time have the Lord’s protection.—Ezekiel 18: 24, 26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Those who have once sought and found refuge on the Lord’s side and who turn again to unrighteousness will die justly. The executioner of Jehovah is entirely justified in slaying such at Armageddon, and his hands are clean, because he carries out Jehovah’s orders. No one in the universe can ever justly say that the slaughter at Armageddon will be barbarous, unjustified or unrighteous. On the contrary, it will meet the requirements of God’s law concerning the sacredness of human life. Christ, the great Avenger and Executioner, will not spare any of the Jonadab company that get outside of Jehovah’s safety arrangement made for them in connection with His organization. Life cannot be granted to any of the Jonadab class until the last member of the priestly class has finished his earthly course. Says the law: ‘After the death of the high priest the slayer may return to his own.’ “The death of the high priest” means the change of the last members of God's “royal priesthood” from human to spirit organism ; which change follows the battle of Armageddon. Then first those of the Jonadab class may find safety on the earth by being obedient to the laws of the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Ruler of the earth.</span></p>

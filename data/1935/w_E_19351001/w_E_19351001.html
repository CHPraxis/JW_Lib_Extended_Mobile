<p><span class="font5">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font5">JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptivo price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare His purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WORLD-WIDE PRAISE PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another nine-day period, October 5 to 13 inclusive, when Jehovah’s anointed remnant, with one voice and one message, and simultaneously on all fronts throughout the world, will compass the modern Midianites and shout the praises of Jehovah and his anointed King, and also warn the people of good will to flee to the mountains of His government. The message recently sent out from Washington, D.C., “to the ends of the earth” will then issue forth m print earth-wide by distribution of the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font5"> by all kingdom publishers, in 49 tongues.

<p><span class="font5">YEAR TEXT FOR 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The text “For Jehovah and for Gideon” (Judges 7:18, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.B.V.</span><span class="font5">) is appropriate for Jehovah’s publishers, and therefore it will be used for 1936 the same as for 1935.

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark15"></a>PRISONERS</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">PART 3</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound . . . ”—Isa. 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH proceeds to the accomplishment of his purpose to bring the prisoners out from bondage, where they are held by Satan. He began this work by selecting Christ Jesus and commissioning him as his elect servant to carry out the divine purpose. This is made certain by the words of Jesus uttered in the synagogue at Nazareth at the beginning of his earthly ministry. There Jesus quoted the words from the prophecy of Isaiah above set forth, and applied them to himself as the One thus selected and commissioned. (Luke 4: 17-21) This application would later be to those who are brought into the royal house, because these are counted as a part of Christ. Quickly following the test which Satan put upon Jesus in the mountain, Jesus began to preach the message of the kingdom and to thus carry forward the commission Jehovah had given him. Even at that time there were those who had agreed to do the will of God and who were bound and restrained by Satan, and to whom Jesus preached and brought them out of darkness into the light. It was the duty of the priesthood of Israel, the covenant people of God, to instruct the people in the law of God, but, instead, they had fallen under the influence of Satan and had become blind, and those blind guides led others into darkness. The people were led to believe that they must obey man instead of obeying God, and hence they looked to their earthly leaders, the priests, Pharisees and Sadducees. Not many were ready to receive Jesus as the one sent of God; but there were a few, and from these Jesus selected his disciples, one of whom later returned to the Devil and his organization, while the others remained faithful to God and to his anointed King. Jesus began his ministry by preaching the good news, to wit: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”; and it was to the meek and teachable ones that this message proved as a blessing, they giving heed to the words of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> At Pentecost the spirit of the Lord came upon the disciples and they understood as never before God’s purpose. Thereafter they boldly preached “the good tidings” of the kingdom, giving their allegiance to God and to Christ and not to any worldly creature. Having been brought out of bondage and appreciating their liberty in Christ, the disciples said to those who sat in Moses’ seat, and who no doubt falsely claimed to be the “higher powers”: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. . . . We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 4: 19; 5: 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah used the one who was foreshadowed by Cyrus, and who is now the Greater Cyrus, to “bind up the broken-hearted”, and to “proclaim liberty to the captives”. This was foretold in the prophecy: “I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Isa. 45: 2,13) The Hebrew word rendered “captives” at Isaiah 61: 1,2 is also rendered “prisoners” at Isaiah 20: 4 and at Numbers 21: 1. The word “captives” has the meaning of ‘transported ones’, who are held in the power of the enemy and in a foreign land. In Isaiah fourteen is recorded the prophecy relating to the taking of the people of Jehovah captives by Satan and then of the release of God’s people, pictured by Jacob; and this prophecy was fulfilled in miniature by natural Israel when delivered from Babylon, and is fulfilled in completeness upon spiritual Israel in the “day of Jehovah”. “For the Lord [Jehovah] will have mercy on Jacob [those faithful to Jehovah], and will yet choose [spiritual] Israel, and set them in their own land, . . . and they shall take them captives whose captives they were.” They were the captives of Satan and his organization, which organization is called “Babylon” and over which Satan is king, and which wicked ruler “made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; [and] opened not the house of his prisoners”.—Isa. 14: 1, 2,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* At the beginning of “the day of Jehovah”, to wit, in 1914, spiritual Israel was in captivity to Satan’s organization, and particularly so during the World War period from 1917 to 1919. These followers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus were denied their liberties, their rights and privileges to engage in God’s service; and later Jehovah sent the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, and brought them out of prison or restraint. Jehovah said to his people: “Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, 0 captive daughter of Zion.” (Isa. 52: 2) This prophecy applied to the faithful upon the coming of the Lord to the temple. These faithful ones, being loosed from prison or condition of restraint, were brought into the temple and anointed, and the commission was given to them as members of Jehovah’s organization under Christ to “proclaim liberty to the captives”, that is, to others still in captivity. These others would include those later brought into the temple, as well as the ‘ ‘ great multitude ’ ’. Beginning with 1919, and particularly in 1922, Jehovah, by the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, and through his anointed ones on the earth, caused the proclamation of “liberty to the captives” to be made. The original faithful remnant were held as captives, but, being released and anointed, they share in proclaiming liberty to others, and this they do by reason of being a part of “the Servant”, Christ Jesus being the chief one to do this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>B</sup>“To them that&quot; are bound” the Lord Jesus has opened the doors of restraint and let them go free. Natural Israel had been carried away captive to Babylon, “bound in chains,” among whom was God’s prophet Jeremiah (40: 1). Samson was taken prisoner by the Philistines and “bound” “with fetters of brass”. (Judg. 16: 5, 21, 22) The statement of Elihu shows that the righteous at times are “bound in fetters”. (Job 36: 7-11) Those who have obligated themselves to Satan’s organization by oaths and who have formed alliances with others in Satan’s organization, and which hinders them from freedom in the Lord and his service, are properly said to be “bound”. That is especially true concerning those who consciously feel that they must faithfully keep their agreement, whether direct or implied, with Satan’s organization and men who are of that organization. Until the Lord’s people came to the understanding of what constitutes the “higher powers” (Rom. 13: 1) they were restrained and were bound in fetters. During the World War even some of God’s people devoted to him and his service strenuously insisted that the “higher powers”, that is to say, the political rulers of the world, must be obeyed, therefore God's people could not properly refuse military service when called to war. Undoubtedly such were “bound in fetters”, as above described. “Them that are bound” certainly included the Ruth and Esther class, which have been brought into Jehovah’s organization from and after 1922. Christ Jesus, the great Judge and Vindicator, has been using the anointed servant class foreshadowed in Mordecai and Naomi to proclaim to others the ‘opening of the prison doors’, and particularly to the Ruth and Esther class. Those bound were logically included in “them that mourn in Zion”, meaning those who were consecrated to do the will of God and who were in line for the kingdom and hence in line for a place in Jehovah’s capital organization, but who, because of ignorance or other influence of Satan, were restrained or bound. They were on Jehovah’s side, therefore of Zion or “in Zion”. These were described as mourning and as sitting in sackcloth and ashes; and the bringing to them of the message of good tidings and ‘the opening to them of the prison doors’ that they might go free would “give unto them beauty for ashes, [and] the oil of joy for mourning”. Being restrained in prison, they had the “spirit of heaviness”; but now, they being released and made free to serve Jehovah, and being identified with others serving God who had brought them the message of deliverance, those who thus brought them the message would be thereby giving them “the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness”. (Isa. 61: 3) Being brought into the light in the temple and anointed of Jehovah, they are also commissioned and empowered to “bind their [the nations of earth] kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron”. (Ps. 149: 8) This is the very work the Lord has been using Jehovah’s witnesses to do, and the work which they have been doing in the years immediately passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> During the period of time elapsing from the coming of the Lord to the temple up to the present date a wide proclamation of the kingdom message has been given, and in that time many people of good will, who sympathize with Jehovah’s witnesses, but who are at the same time bound by and in restraint to Satan’s organization, have heard the truth. These people of good will have understood that the higher powers are the political rulers and the religious leaders of this world, to which every soul must be subject. Seeing many wicked things committed in the organization called falsely “the Christian nations”, these people of good will have sighed and cried because of the wickedness manifested by those who have them in bondage. They have desired to serve God and do right, but their fear of offending men and losing something themselves has held them in bondage. Such people of good will may be in the political-religious systems called “churches”, and they may be outside of the same, but they are in bondage to Satan’s organization, and there they remain until the Lord, by his witnesses, sends them the message of truth; and when they learn that Jehovah is the only true God, and Christ Jesus is his King, and that these are the “higher powers” to which every soul must be subject, they see that the prison doors have been opened to them and they arise to the opportunity to escape, and they do escape and devote themselves to God and his organization. Then they cease to sigh and to cry because of the abominations that are practiced in Satan’s organization, and, on the contrary, they rejoice that they have found the way out and are free. Jehovah has commissioned his anointed witnesses to bear the message of truth to others, and has therefore laid upon them the obligation of informing all who desire to be free how their freedom may be obtained. “And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.” (Ezek. 9: 4) This work must be done and completed before the smiting of Satan’s organization takes place at Armageddon. Thus it is seen that, beginning with Jesus Christ, all who come into the anointed company of Jehovah must first be released from prison and then they must carry the message to others who are in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>T</sup> Let the anointed ones of the Lord fully recognize that they cannot side-step or treat lightly the commission and obligation laid upon them by Jehovah. The clear, positive and emphatic commandment of the Lord is that they must go and ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom to the nations as a witness’. This commandment is not at all discretionary, but is absolutely mandatory. “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not .hear [obey] that prophet [the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Lord and Judge] shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3: 23) It is written that those who were once bound and who have been set at liberty and anointed “shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen, and your vinedressers. But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord; men [of good will desiring to know and serve Jehovah] shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles [nations (R.V.)], and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.” (Isa. 61: 4-6) This clearly shows that the anointed must carry the message of truth to the Jonadabs, the great multitude. Furthermore, says the prophet of Jehovah: “And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.”-Isa. 58: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• The obligation is laid upon the anointed remnant, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, to participate in presenting to the honest people of earth the truth concerning the kingdom of God, and this work they must do before Armageddon. Jesus makes this emphatic in his statement in Matthew 24: 14, 21, 22. It is the truth that serves to the opening of the doors to them that are bound, that they may willingly and intelligently go free, and this freedom granted to them is granted by Jehovah’s great Vindicator, who makes them entirely free by reason of devoting themselves wholly to God and to Christ Jesus.—John 8: 32-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">COMING OF THE KING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> That Jehovah’s covenant people were in prison at the time of the coming of the King for judgment is further shown by the prophecy uttered by Zechariah. This matter is considered in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font6"> at pages 162 and following, and there the “other sheep”, the “great multitude”, are improperly spoken of as the “tribulation class”. This improper statement comes from the habit of following a mistake long ago committed. The prophecy of Zechariah is addressed to the creatures who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and are of his organization, born of his woman, and there the prophet says: “Rejoice greatly, 0 daughter of Zion; . . . behold, thy King cometh unto thee.” It is to Zion that Jehovah, by his prophet, says: “As for thee also, by [because of] the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.” (Zech. 9: 9-11) This prophecy of Zechariah, at verses eleven and twelve, positively states that the covenant people of God were prisoners at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. Jehovah sent forth the Lord Jesus, his elect servant, and delivered the faithful from prison where they were held in restraint to Satan’s organization, which is called “Babylon”. “The Lord loos-eth the prisoners.” (Ps. 146: 7) Because of the blood of the new covenant, shed by Jehovah’s Son, that covenant was inaugurated toward the company of the Lord’s people who were found faithful at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple in 1918. There he is presented as King and Head of Zion. It is by or because of the blood of the King himself that the new covenant is inaugurated and that the “prisoners” are sent out of the pit, as is described by the prophet Zechariah (9: 11). This was foreshadowed in natural Israel, who were in Egypt in bondage or prison, there restrained by Satan and his organization; and before they could be released there must be shed the blood of the lamb foretelling the shed blood of Christ Jesus the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world. That first law covenant was inaugurated with blood; and so it must be that the new covenant is inaugurated with blood. (Heb. 9: 18, 20) It follows that if the covenanters are to fulfill the commission to be ‘a people taken out for his name’, and be witnesses to his name, they must be released and set free from prison or the restraint of Satan’s organization, and hence in harmony therewith the prophet writes: “The Lord looseth the prisoners.” (Ps. 146: 7) For what purpose arc these prisoners loosed? The answer is given by God’s prophet: “To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.” (Ps. 102: 21, 22) Surely this means when the Lord Jesus appears at the temple, and before him are gathered the nations.—Matt. 25: 31, 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Upon the coming of Christ Jesus the King to the temple, who were those prisoners described in the prophecy? The prophet states that they were in ‘the pit where there was no water’, and they were put there by Satan’s official organization on the earth. Jeremiah the prophet of Jehovah was likewise imprisoned, and he pictured Jehovah’s faithful people, and concerning whom it was written: “Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.”—Jer. 38: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> In Jeremiah’s case the dungeon manifestly was an abandoned wellhole or cistern, which had been prepared and used for water but which, in fact, at that time contained no water, but contained only mud or mire. During the World War Satan’s organization cast God’s people into prison; that is to say, the entire number of God’s faithful ones were either directly or indirectly restrained of their liberty and held in subjection to Satan’s official organization. That wicked organization, and particularly the clergy part thereof, would have their prisoners believe that their cisterns contained living waters, but, in fact, they contained nothing but mud and slime and no living water was used in them. Some of the Lord’s children who were in actual prison were compelled at least once a week to appear before the clergy of the Devil’s organization and listen to the representative of that organization ‘fill his belly with the east wind’ and make others stand around ‘in the mud’. Satan’s organization was then and is now entirely void of the life-giving waters of the truth. This is supported by the Lamentations of the prophet, which foreshadowed the condition of spiritual Israel during the World War period. “Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. Waters flowed over mine head [but did not get into the dungeon] ; then I said, I am cut off. I called upon thy name, 0 Lord, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 0 Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.”—Lam. 3: 52-58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> During the dark period of the World War God’s people were in prison or restraint, yet having hope of deliverance to the end that they might serve Jehovah and praise him. To them Jehovah through his prophet said: “Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.” (Zech. 9:12) In that dark period of the World War Jehovah’s people did not realize that their King had come to the temple, and not for some years thereafter did they learn and appreciate it, and then they did turn to Zion, the stronghold of which is Jehovah and his King and Vindicator. Those prisoners of hope and of Zion, which is God’s organization, being loosed in 1919 and brought into full accord with Zion at the inauguration of the new covenant, were united with the Lord in the temple. Throughout the temple they began to be enlightened and later came to an appreciation of the foregoing and other prophecies. Since being brought into the temple they appreciate that the Lord has rendered unto Zion, including themselves, a double portion. The word “double” used in the prophecy of Zechariah means twice as much, and it was at the early part of the Elisha work, when Jehovah anointed his “faithful servant” class, that a ‘double portion of the Elijah spirit’ was given to the anointed ones who are commissioned and commanded to engage in and perform the work foreshadowed by Elisha. The important point here is that the faithful servant class were in the pit as prisoners, there hoping for the coming of the King; and the King having brought them out of prison and into the temple and anointed them, they are given a double portion of the spirit of Elijah and these faithful anointed ones become a part of the stronghold, that is to say, Zion, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and over all of which is Jehovah. These are the ones who then say: “This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, and desolate, and ruined cities, are become fenced, and are inhabited.”—Ezek. 36: 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> The released prisoners now become Jehovah’s witnesses and the object of assault by “Christendom”, the agent of Satan. They being released, then the nations round about, meaning the people of good will round about them, begin to know the Lord. “Then the heathen, that are left round about you, shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate; I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.” (Ezek. 36: 36) These faithful ones are also pictured by the prophet Jeremiah; and to those whom Jeremiah pictured Jehovah says: “And I will make thee [the remnant, pictured by the prophet Jeremiah] unto this people [‘Christendom,’ which is of Satan’s organization] a fenced brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 15: 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> In harmony with the foregoing prophecy of Jeremiah Jesus spoke a parable (Matt. 25: 36), which applies at the beginning of judgment at the temple. Since then Satan’s organization has continued to assault Jehovah’s witnesses, and constantly some of these are thrown into prison, as foretold by Jesus; but these are not “prisoners of hope”, such as described by the prophet Zechariah. Like the apostle Paul, who was imprisoned by Satan’s organization because of his faithfulness, so now Jehovah’s witnesses are at times imprisoned and these are ‘prisoners of Jesus Christ’. That means that they belong to Christ and are imprisoned by the enemy because of their faithfulness. Like the apostle Paul, even though imprisoned these faithful ones continue to boldly preach the gospel of the kingdom while in the prison, and as quickly as they get out they keep on preaching.—Acts 28:20; Eph. 4:1; 2 Tim. 1:8; Philem. 1,9; Heb. 13:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Formerly these were prisoners held by Satan’s organization because of their lack of knowledge and appreciation of the truth, and, being in darkness and restrained, they ceased their preaching of the gospel; but now being brought into full light and liberty in Christ Jesus, they boldly proclaim the truth regardless of whether they are in literal prison or outside of the same. They are determined to prove their integrity to Jehovah under all conditions. Satan and his agents may put restraint upon the organization made up of Jehovah’s witnesses, but no longer can Satan and his wicked agents at all hold their minds and heart devotion to the Lord in any wise in restraint. Even though thrown into literal prisons by reason of their faithfulness in preaching the gospel, they will continue to take advantage of every opportunity to preach the gospel of the kingdom and, when released, they will not slack their hand but go on regardless of what Satan’s organization may do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">IN BONDAGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> When a creature is a slave to another, he is properly said to be in bondage or in prison. If, because of fear of another creature or an organization having dominion over him, a person refuses to perform his real duty, which he is commissioned too to perform, then it is properly said of him that he is in bondage. The apostle Paul, addressing those who have agreed to do the will of God, wrote the epistle to the Hebrews under inspiration by the Lord. In the second chapter he centers his argument upon Christ Jesus, upon his brethren, and upon their adversary the Devil, who seeks their destruction. Then he says: “And might deliver [liberate </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)]</span><span class="font6"> all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” (Heb. 2: 15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font6"> Who are those here mentioned as “all their lifetime subject to bondage”? When it pleases the Lord to make clear to his people the meaning of his prophecy, the proper understanding of one prophecy makes clearer other portions of God’s Word. For this reason it is found necessary from time to time to make some change in what has been said about the Word of the Lord, which change in expression is due to clearer light that has been given to the people of God since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. The promise is that the light shall continue to shine with increased brilliancy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>JT</sup> Now as to the question in the preceding paragraph: In finding the answer to that question the context must be taken into consideration. The apostle is writing about the sons of God called to glory, and of which Christ Jesus is the Captain, Head and Lord. Neither the Jews nor the great multitude are considered in this text. There would be no reason to consider either class. The question at issue between the Devil and Jehovah relates to human creatures, and not to angels, and hence angels cannot be included in the foregoing question and the answer. Can Jehovah put men on earth who will remain true and faithful to him? is the question for determination. God declares his purpose, not only to decide that matter in his own favor, but that he would take from amongst the human creatures those whom he would exalt to rulership of the world. The royal class or house is “the seed of Abraham”, that is to say, the seed of promise, the seed or sons of Jehovah God, whom Abraham pictured. Jesus speaks of himself and his brethren and says: “Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.” (Isa. 8: 18; Heb. 2: 13) This prophecy was written by Isaiah and without a question of doubt applies to Jesus; and Paul so applies it. The children whom God gave Jesus to be associated with him are human creatures, that is, flesh and blood; and in order to settle the question at issue and defeat Satan, who challenged Jehovah, Jesus must be made flesh and blood. In Hebrews 2: 14 it is so stated, that he was made flesh and blood. He must as a man be subjected to the most severe test, which test would entail upon him great suffering, and he must come through that test victorious; therefore say the Scriptures: “It became him ... to make the captain of [our] salvation perfect through sufferings.” (Heb. 2: 10) Such suffering of Jesus was necessary in order to prove his integrity unto God and to qualify him to become Jehovah’s Vindicator. “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”—Heb. 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The Devil has power of death, and the one who would become Jehovah’s Vindicator must defeat and destroy the Devil. Jesus proved his integrity even unto an ignominious death as a sinner and in the place of sinners, and thereby Jesus proved himself qualified to be the Vindicator of Jehovah and the Author of eternal salvation. All this Jesus did that he “might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil”, and that he ‘might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage’. It could not be said that the nation of Israel or the great multitude were the ones here mentioned as being in bondage because of fear of death, for several reasons: The nation of Israel as a whole had not been “called to glory”, even though a remnant of that people were called to that high calling. It must be kept in mind that it is stated in Hebrews 2: 10 that ‘in bringing many sons unto glory Jesus was perfected through sufferings’; furthermore the nation of Israel did not have life, and therefore they could not “all their lifetime” be subject to bondage. In fact, no one had life until the coming of Christ Jesus. He said: “I am come that they might have life.” ‘Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.’—John 10: 10; Rom. 6: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> The great multitude was not then in existence, and the great multitude has not life, and could not have until that multitude is brought forth and receives life as God has provided. Neither the nation of natural Israel nor the great multitude are then considered in the Scriptures above written by the apostle Paul. Neither are they the ones to whom help is given. Nor is it the angels that are helped. Verse sixteen of that chapter reads: “For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.”—Heb. 2:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.li.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The ones, and the only ones, considered here are the “holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling”, of whom Christ Jesus is the Head and Prince. (Heb. 3: 1) Such are the ones that are begotten to life as the sons of God, and therefore are in Christ, and their life is hid in him. (1 Pet. 1: 3; Col. 3: 3) The life of such began when they were brought forth as the spirit sons of God. (Rom. 8: 16,17; 1 John 3: 1) These are the ones, and only ones, called to glory and ‘‘whose names are [written] in the book of life”. (Phil. 4: 3) The condition precedent to their receiving life everlasting is full and complete faithfulness unto God, they maintaining their integrity toward God unto the end of their earthly journey. —Rev. 2: 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> From the very moment one is brought forth as a son of God through Christ Jesus, the Head and author of eternal salvation, that one is the object of Satan’s assault and must suffer at the hands of Satan the Devil, ‘who has power of death.’ It was Jesus whom Satan sought to kill, and he has sought to kill all His faithful followers. The apostle’s argument settles it beyond all question that it is Christ Jesus and his body members that are being considered in the second chapter of Hebrews. Every one of these Satan would kill unless they had help from Jehovah. From the beginning of the life of each one of the followers of Christ Jesus they have been objects of assault and have therefore been ‘through fear of death subjected to bondage by Satan’. What death is feared by them ? Not natural death due to the Adamic sin, but death by ‘him that hath power of death, that is the Devil’. Such punishment by death is inflicted by Satan and his organization and through his agents. That fear of death at the hand of Satan’s organization has held back all of the begotten sons of God at some time from full devotion to Jehovah and his service. Such must have been true with those who early came to the knowledge of the truth, because to them the apostle wrote: ‘‘For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”—Rom. 8: 14,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">** The apostle was encouraging them to depart from fear. The followers of Christ Jesus in the day of the apostles must have been ashamed and fearful to give testimony concerning the kingdom; otherwise the apostle would not have written these words: ‘‘For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.”-2 Tim. 1: 7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> Have not all of God’s people had more or less fear that they might suffer death at the hands of the Devil’s organization if they persisted in telling the truth? Such fear must be put away at some time; and how? By the help and strength that comes to them through, the Lord Jesus Christ; by learning of him and confidently trusting in his power; by a complete devotion to him, thus showing perfect love for God and Christ Jesus. ‘‘Perfect love casteth out fear.” —1 John 4: 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> Have the Lord’s people come to that point when they have perfect love and when fear has departed? Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, and the gathering unto himself of the faithful, and they there in the temple receiving instruction from the Lord, they have been purged of all fear. ‘‘The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29: 25) Prior to that time all of the Lord’s people have looked to some man or men and have feared other men; but coming to realize that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are their teachers, and that they are the special recipients of God’s favor, they cast a-way fear. The Lord Jesus removed from them the bondage of fear and says to them: ‘‘Fear them not therefore; for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”—Matt. 10: 26-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> When did the remnant get a clear understanding of these scriptures? Not until after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, and then they received help from the Lord. It was then that these words of Jesus applied. It was then that the words of the apostle particularly applied, that the Lord Jesus delivered them who during the times since they were begotten of the spirit had been in fear of death at the hands of the Devil. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> 1933, page 323) It is particularly after' the Lord Jesus comes to the temple that he as the author of salvation and Jehovah’s Vindicator giveth help to the “seed of Abraham”, who have been in bondage by reason of fear of the Devil. (Hob. 2: 15,16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ii.V.)</span><span class="font6"> To participate with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name the remnant must be delivered and purged of all fear of the Devil or any of his agents. Now the Devil and his crowd assault Jehovah’s people more vigorously than at any time, probably, and yet, regardless thereof, and without fear of man or devil, but trusting wholly in the Lord, they press on fulfilling the commandments that God has given them. They are not under Satan’s organization and have no fear. They know that Satan may actually kill their organism, but only God can destroy their right to life, and for this reason Jesus warns them to fear not him that can kill the body, but fear only Him who can destroy the right to life in Gehenna. Trusting implicitly in Jehovah and his great Vindicator, the faithful remnant have been delivered by the great Vindicator and no more fear the Devil and his agents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘LOOSING THE FOUR ANGELS’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> The word “angels” does not always apply to creatures having a spirit organism, but often means a commissioned messenger wnth a message from Jehovah God. Spirit creatures with spirit bodies accompany Christ Jesus as his servants and serve at the temple. (Matt. 25: 31) At Revelation 9: 13 Christ Jesus at the temple, and who is the great High Priest of Jehovah, is shown giving direction to the sixth angel that had the trumpet saying: “Loose the four angels [commissioned messengers] that are bound [who have been bound </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)]</span><span class="font6"> at the great river Euphrates.” (Rev. 9: 14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.Ii.V.)</span><span class="font6"> The number four here used signifies the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses in the four quarters of the earth, in a strong working body, doing the service of Jesus Christ under commandment from Christ Jesus and Jehovah. The fact that the command is given to loose them shows that up to a time certain they have been bound. Heretofore this scripture has been applied to the “great multitude ’ ’; but that could not be the correct application. The “four angels” or commissioned messengers are all of Jehovah’s witnesses anointed and commissioned and commanded by him to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth. The language used clearly implies that these witnesses must first be loosed from restraint and then be prepared and equipped for the w’ork assigned to them. Now, by the grace of the Lord, we have clearer light as to who constitutes the great multitude, and applying the well-known facts to the prophecy it seems clear that the application to the anointed remnant who constitute the commissioned witnesses of Jehovah in the earth at the present time is the correct application. These are the ones referred to when the great prophet said: “Loose the four angels.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> During the World War period the faithful servant class were in prison or restraint by Satan’s organization. Their release took place in March, 1919, and on the 27th day of March, 1919, efforts were begun to organize and carry forward the witness work. At that time there was no organization prepared for the work. It was then that God ‘took his woman into the wilderness’, that is to say, the people of his organization into the condition which he had prepared for them. (Rev. 12: 14) This preparatory work progressed and reached a climax in July, 1927, at the Toronto convention, when the proclamation was sent forth “To the Peoples of Christendom”, and supported by a public address, both of which shortly thereafter were issued in a publication under the title “Freedom for the People”, and millions of copies of which were distributed throughout “Christendom”.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Responding to the commandment given it is written: “And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.” (Rev. 9: 15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.Ii.V.)</span><span class="font6"> That loosing, which began in 1919 and which reached a climax in the forward movement in 1927, was done by the Greater Cyrus. Christ Jesus commanded that his angel, who held the sixth trumpet, should give the signal to go. Everything was prepared, and the onward march began with great zeal. (Ps. 146: 7; Isa. 45: 1,13) It was then that Jehovah’s witnesses were turned loose upon “Christendom” to do the work which God had provided for them to do. That convention at Toronto was announced in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> as “a service convention”, which indeed it was. It was there that God’s people introduced themselves to the people of “Christendom” as “witnesses to the name of Jehovah God”, marking them as the people whom God has taken out for his name. tSce </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font6"> 1927, page 307.) “The four angels,” that is to say, Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, scattered to the four corners of the earth, were now better prepared than they had previously been to carry the message of God and his kingdom to the people. That marked the beginning of a campaign calling upon the people to break away from the bondage of Satan’s organization and declare themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom. The following quotation from the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font6"> and from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> and which message began to be delivered July 24, 1927, seems here appropriate:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“The people desire peace, freedom, prosperity, life and happiness. All thinking persons must now see these can come only from God’s kingdom through Christ. They can never be realized by or through the false system called ‘organized Christianity’. The hypocritical and evil course of ‘Christendom’ is an insult to God and to Christ. It is the deceiver and oppressor of the people. It is completely under the control of Satan the Devil. It depends for its support and maintenance upon the multitudes of peoples, while at the same time it continues to defraud and oppress the people. Let the multitudes of peoples completely and entirely -withdraw all support morally, financially, and otherwise from ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’ so called. Let them give their hearts’ devotion and allegiance entirely to God and to Christ, the Prince of Peace, who is now earth’s rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let them dwell together in peace, and do good to each other, and be ready to receive the blessings which God has in reservation for those who love and obey him. The day of complete freedom is at hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The peoples should therefore for ever abandon and forsake ‘organized Christianity’ called ‘Christendom’ and turn their hearts and minds and their allegiance wholly to God and his Christ for the following reasons, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ (1) Because ‘Christendom’ is the Devil’s organization operated by him to keep the people in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“(2) Because it is an instrument of oppression which has been used to make the burdens of men grievous to be borne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“(3) Because it is false, hypocritical, and wicked, and against the interests of the multitudes of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“(4) Because it holds out absolutely no hope for the betterment of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“(5) Because God’s time has come when that evil and hypocritical system shall be destroyed in the greatest time of trouble the world has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“(6) Because God commands all the peoples who love him to flee from that unrighteous system of so-called ‘organized Christianity’ and thereby escape the dire calamities that shortly shall befall her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ (7) Because God has set his anointed King, Christ Jesus the Messiah, upon his throne, and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and obey him; and those who so do shall receive and for ever enjoy the blessings of complete freedom, everlasting peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The ancient city of Babylon was located on the river Euphrates and controlled the traffic and commerce of that river. It was the main part of the ‘waters of Babylon’. (Ps. 137:1,3) God’s prophet foretold how spiritual Israel would be carried away captive to the river Euphrates. (Jer. 13: 1-11) The “great river” was where the prisoners were bound, therefore picturing the multitudes of people under the control and dominion of Satan’s organization. “And he saith unto me, The waters which thou saw-est, where the whore [Babylon, Satan’s woman or organization] sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”—Rev. 17: 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> “The four angels were loosed ... that they should kill the third part of men.” (Rev. 9: 15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A..R.V.)</span><span class="font6"> Satan’s organization is “divided into three parts” (Rev. 16:19), to wit: commercial, political and religious; therefore the expression “the third part of men” would not mean one third of Satan’s organization, but would symbolize the three-divisioned official element of Babylon. It is therefore seen now that the Lord through his angel directed the preparation of the contents of the booklet Freedom </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for the Peoples, </span><span class="font6">which dealt with all three of the elements of Satan’s organization, to wit, high finance, statesmen and the clergy. God’s message of truth, like fire and brimstone, “shocked the religious susceptibilities” of the chief moguls of “Christendom”, and their mouthpieces, the public press and magazines, re-echoed their many howls. So badly was the National Broadcasting Company burned and scorched by the turning loose of that message of truth that thereafter its radio facilities cannot be used to broadcast the message of God’s kingdom. Then the ‘waters of the great Euphrates’ began to dry up, because the Greater Cyrus had turned them away to prepare “the way of the kings of the east”. (Rev. 16: 12-16) This drying up of the river Euphrates follows the loosening of the four angels, which were bound, and it seems clearly to signify that other bound ones aside from Jehovah’s witnesses would be released and march joyfully to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> Prior to the time of the Toronto convention many of the consecrated were still bound in fear, and thus their service to the Lord was hindered. Thereafter Jehovah’s witnesses became bolder and fearless. The witness work moved forward with greater unity and increased zeal. At that convention an address was delivered on the subject “The Mission of a Christian”, and the great importance of house-to-house preaching of the gospel of the kingdom was stressed. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> November 1, 1927, paragraphs 31-37.) It was at that convention in 1927 that the “pilgrim service” was superseded by the “service directors”. The pioneer service increased from that time onward. These matters were not deliberately arranged in advance by men, but the Lord himself directed them, because he is in charge of the service work of carrying the message to the people. He directs his angels what to do, and through them steers his witnesses on earth in the right direction, and all praise and honor is due to the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">MILITANT ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah’s organization must of necessity be a militant body. While Jesus is the ‘elect Servant’, and the one to whom the prophecy of Isaiah 61: 1, 2 is specifically applied, yet he could not perform all of that commission at the time of his first presence, in A.D. 33. He quoted a part of that prophecy uttered by Isaiah and applied it to himself, but be it noted that he omitted in the quotation the words ‘ ‘ the day of vengeance of our God”. After he is enthroned Christ Jesus appears at the temple for judgment, which judgment includes not only the declaration of God’s vengeance but the execution thereof. The judgment of the Lord begins at the house of God. Before him are gathered all who have covenanted to do God’s will and been called to the kingdom. It is the time of Jehovah’s judgment by Christ Jesus. “He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.”—Ps. 50:4-6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">•* At the judgment Jehovah says to all who are in the covenant or who claim to be: “Hear, 0 my people, and I will speak; 0 [spiritual] Israel, and I will testify against thee [(R.V.) unto thee]: I am God, even thy God.” (Ps. 50: 7) Thus Jehovah addresses the ones gathered before the Lord. The sanctuary now must be cleansed, and only those who are cleansed and approved may remain in the temple and are the ones commissioned and who must obey every commandment of the Lord, that great Prophet. (Acts 3: 23) These approved ones the Lord has brought out of bondage even as he did natural Israel, and they must have no other God besides him but must be wholly obedient to Jehovah. (Ex. 20: 1,2) Since the beginning of the day of Jehovah, in 1914, it is true according to the word of the Scriptures that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof”. (Ps. 24: 1) Now the Lord calls not for sacrifice and formalism and sanctimoniousness, but calls for complete obedience and says: “I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds; for every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.”—Ps. 50: 9-13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> No formal worship, nor “character development”, nor sanctimoniousness, nor any kind of like “sacrifice”, could put Jehovah under obligation to anyone. Only complete and unselfish devotion to Jehovah now pleases him. “Elective elders” and the clergy put their own teachings before God’s people, but such is not meat and drink for anyone. That which now is acceptable to God is the joyful performance of his holy will. This is required of those who are gathered unto him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>85</sup> The remnant must now perform their covenant. “Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High.” (Ps. 50: 14) There can be no dividing of service and devotion, nor any compromise with the world. If the servant class now give their full devotion to Jehovah God he will not bring down the wrath of Satan’s crowd upon them; and therefore he says: “And call upon me in the day of trouble ; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ’ ’ (Ps. 50: 15) Clearly this implies a fight while the faithful servant class continue to declare the vengeance of our God. After this first gathering, then the Ruth and Esther class are released from bondage of Satan’s organization and they join the militant ranks of the Lord’s organization. All of the servant class now vigorously proclaim the day of the vengeance of our God, whereupon all of those of good will, hearing the message, flee from Satan’s organization and take refuge in God’s organization. The “other sheep”, who escape from prison and find refuge in God’s organization, hear the message and they take it up and repeat it to others. It is a war to the end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>86</sup> Some timid ones to justify their timidity cite the words of Jesus, to wit: “But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another; for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.” (Matt. 10:23) The instruction of Jesus here given to ‘flee to another city’ had application in the days of the apostles, because the day of the vengeance of our God was not then due to be declared. Now ‘the Son of man is come’, and the day of the vengeance of our God must be declared, and now there is no backing down of God’s people. Jehovah’s organization must be aggressive and militant and never hesitate to go forward, but remain firm always for the Lord, declaring the message of the kingdom, that they may continue to serve notice on the people that Satan’s organization will be completely wrecked at Armageddon. No longer are the people of God put in bondage and fear of what the Devil might do against them. Jehovah has sent them forth as his witnesses, and he says to them: ‘Obey, and I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me. ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> Jehovah prepares for himself a people which he specially makes manifest in the vindication of his name. That people must be a militant organization because they are fighting against and must continue to fight against the Devil and his organization. Christ Jesus is now present and in command. He is the Vindicator and Author of Salvation, and all who will live must obey him. The spirit of Jehovah is put upon Christ Jesus, and he delivers from prison the faithful ones who become a part of The Servant. These servants of Jehovah then bring the message to the Ruth and Esther class, who are also in bondage and who must be released and made members of the servant class. It is to this class of anointed ones that Jehovah speaks through his prophet and upon whom he has put his spirit, and to whom he has given the testimony of Jesus Christ, and they must, in obedience to his commandment, deliver that testimony. It is against these that the Dragon, the Devil, comes forth to make war, seeking their destruction. Now every one of the remnant class must resist the Devil and do it vigorously. That means to resist the Devil’s agents by truly and faithfully serving the Lord. (1 Pet. 5:8) That means a fight to the end, and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will continue fearlessly to follow his leading whithersoever he directs them to go. These faithful ones refuse to have anything in common with the worldly organization of Satan. They hear and obey the words of Jehovah: “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary.” (Isa. 8: 13,14) With full confidence in Jehovah and his executive officer, Christ Jesus, the faithful remnant go forth to the performance of their covenant, and as they go they sing out constantly: “The Sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.” These faithful ones are “trees of righteousness”, planted by Jehovah to his glory, and made righteous by his grace. Boldly and zealously they continue to proclaim his name and his kingdom. The “great multitude”, or “other sheep”, flee out of Babylon and flee to the organization of the Lord, and they too join the militant organization and take up the cry: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the hope of all creation is the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■<sup>18</sup> If what has been said concerning the great multitude is Scripturally correct, to wit, that these are not spirit-begotten creatures, but that the great multitude constitute the “other sheep” mentioned by the Lord, and are the same as the Jonadabs, and their hope is everlasting life on the earth, then how about the ‘foolish virgins’ described by Jesus in the parable? Don’t those foolish virgins foreshadow a secondary spiritual class who get life in heaven? This question will be considered in another issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark16"></a>HABAKKUK’S VISION: A SUMMARY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font6">ABAKKUK the prophet stood as a prophetic representation of the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth. Having made pressing inquiries of Jehovah, and having received the answers from him, Habakkuk was filled with prayer, thanksgiving and joy, and he uttered a song of ecstasy: “A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.” (3:1) According to the Hebrew root of the term “Shigionoth” it implies rapture or being enraptured and means a psalm or song of ecstasy which rises to the heights of rapture, as Jehovah gave Habakkuk a vision of what was to come to pass at the battle of Armageddon. That battle is very’ near!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“O Lord, I have heard thy speech [report (A.72.P.)], and was afraid: 0 Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy. God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.” (3: 2,3) Likewise now the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses have heard the report of Jehovah’s past fame and that at Armageddon his fame will be universal. They have heard the speech, the words, of Jehovah telling of that battle that draws very near, and they stand in awe and fear before the Lord. Trusting in Jehovah they are not afraid for themselves or for their own safety, but because of the fearfulness and dreadfulness of the manifestation of his power at Armageddon they fear and tremble. They have in mind that all the nations will be involved; that men composing the armies on earth, who are against Jehovah God and his people, will fall and that this will be a slaughter of multitudes, when “their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth” (Zech. 14: 12), and there will not be a sufficient number surviving to bury the dead. God’s remnant realize the import of Jesus’ words that it will be a tribulation such as the world has never known and that there will never be another like it. Never anything so great and terrible as what will take place at Armageddon. It will be a fight by Almighty God against entrenched and desperate enemies. The power there exhibited by Jehovah will strike terror in all creation. Even the inanimate objects will tremble. The things Jehovah did to the enemies of his people in times of old were examples of what shall now come to pass at Armageddon. Safety and security are only to those who fully trust in and serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Habakkuk 3: 3 appears the word “Selah”, which word means “pause”, or “suspension” of the music or song, and would indicate a pause in what is done or said by God’s remnant of witnesses. The great spectacular demonstration of Jehovah’s power would certainly cause the remnant to pause and remain absolutely dumb for a time. Immediately following the pause the prophecy reads: “His [Jehovah’s] glory covered the heavens.” That will be a dazzling manifestation of Jehovah’s power appearing in the sky and will surpass the sun’s brilliancy at high noon. At that time it must be that “the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (2: 14), and all nations and tribes and peoples of the earth shall see it at that one time. God has repeatedly stated concerning his enemies that ‘they shall know that I am Jehovah God’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Describing the opening of the battle, Habakkuk says: “And the earth was full of his praise.” Certain it is that the enemy will not be singing Jehovah’s praises. Therefore this part of verse three must mean that God’s praises will be sung by the small band of his witnesses on the earth as they behold his glory and the marching of his war hosts on going into battle. This will occur at the time that the fight is beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And his brightness was as the light [like the sunlight (Leeser)] ; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.” (3: 4) It is truly written that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. (1 John 1: 5) At Armageddon he will make his glorious light to shine, that all may see his glory. “Rays streamed forth out of his hand.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah’s rays of light are power; like horns they push back the forces of darkness into destruction. The horns are like prods, prodding the enemy. It is the glorious hand of the Almighty God, and the rays of light from his hand are bolts of lightning hurled forth from his hand and working destruction upon the enemy. The ‘open hand’ well pictures Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah uses as his executioner to destroy the enemy. “And there was the hiding of his power”; that is, the hiding of his power is in his hand. All power in heaven and in earth God has committed to the hand of Christ Jesus, who will execute that power in God’s due time. (Matt. 28: 18; John 5: 27) During the long period of time when Satan has been the unhindered ruler of this dark world, even up until 1914, that great power of Jehovah has been concealed. At Armageddon the “hand” of Jehovah is to be opened to the natural senses of those who then dwell upon the earth.—Ps. 110: 2-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The invincible Jehovah of Hosts marches to the war, and everything must perish before him: “Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.” (3: 5) “Christendom’s” sanitary and medical and hospital corps that have fought against diseases will be powerless at the time of Armageddon to stay the pestilence and disease. Jehovah God will smite the enemy therewith, and all who have been and who are against his holy organization shall suffer the pestilence and plagues which he has caused to be described in his Word. (Zech. 14: 12) “And burning coals [(R.V.) fiery bolts] went forth at his feet.” The basic sense of the Hebrew is that of burning, whether’ with hot coals, lightning or disease. Warning concerning these burnings has been given to the nations by Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to the Lord’s commandments.—Ezek. 10: 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In A.D. 1914, at the command of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, who is in heaven “Michael the Prince”, stood up to reign as King. (Daniel 12:1) This mighty Prince makes inspection of the earth before beginning Armageddon. Says the prophet Habakkuk (3: 6): “He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations: and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.” While Christ Jesus at Jehovah’s command has been taking the measures of the earth, he has also caused his witnesses to go throughout the earth and to declare his judgment. When the time for Armageddon is reached, the Lord will not stand still or halt in his marching against the foe. He will shake the heavens and the earth and move with rapidity of the whirlwind. “He stood forward, and made the earth to tremble.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser</span><span class="font6"> translation) At Mount Sinai, when Jehovah gave the “ten commandments” to Moses, the earth shook. That was merely a sample of what shall come to pass at Armageddon. Shall Jehovah then permit the nations that have defamed his name to continue their wicked course? Habakkuk’s prayer-song answers: “He beheld, and [then] drove asunder the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men who rule in this world claim that the nations, pictured by the mountains, are everlasting and shall never perish. Those who push schemes for so-called “national recovery” claim the nations must and will endure for ever and that the present world sickness is only temporary and that these earthly schemes will pull the nations out of the hole and they will continue on without end. But Jehovah can and will level them to the ground, and this by the hand of Christ. (Ps. 2: 9) If it be God’s will, he can make the literal mountains to melt, as prophesied at Micah 1:3,4; but it appears that such text refers to the nations of the earth, which shall be melted down, leveled, and disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The superruling elements of the earth, the men that really dictate the policies of the various nations, are not the men so much in the limelight, but are in fact the ones who stay to the rear. Seldom seen, and little being known of them by the public, they are the ones that tell the men in the saddle what to do. Now, a hill is the highest point in a mountain; therefore the “hills” picture the highest or superpower ruling men of earth’s nations. Such men never bow to other men or to God, but at Armageddon they will have to get down and crawl in the dust. “The perpetual hills did bow.” (3:6) They “are sunk” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham); </span><span class="font6">they “were bowed down”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay)</span><span class="font6"> Those international superpower men are never subject to local activities, but rise to the very top and above the others and think themselves invulnerable, “perpetual,” to all the forces of the nations; but at Armageddon these exalted ones shall be brought low and be abased. On this God’s Word is plain and explicit.—Matt. 23:12; Isa. 2:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Says Habakkuk: Jehovah’s “ways are everlasting”. (3: 6) “His goings were as of old.” (R.V.) He does not change. (Mal. 3: 6) His ways of long ago God can and will duplicate at Armageddon on a far grander scale than ever before. In the long ago past God performed certain acts which there in miniature vindicated his name, but at Armageddon his work will be strange and miraculous, beyond anything that has ever been done: when he comes forth to defend his cause and his people he will “be his old self again”, and all creation shall know that Jehovah is the almighty, supreme One.—Isa. 28: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I saw the [war] tents of Cushan [enemy of Jehovah’s people] in affliction: and the [tent] curtains of the land of Midian [oppressors of Jehovah’s people] did tremble” in fear. (3:7) In Scripture “rivers” picture the peoples of the nations under Satan’s control, some willingly and some unwillingly. “Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea [which gives support to and bears up the oppressive commercial organization of Satan on the earth], that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?” (3: 8) By the time of Armageddon that part of the human “rivers” now known as ‘people of good will’ and like Jonadab of old (2 Ki. 10: 15-23) will have turned aside from Satan’s crowd, that they may escape the trouble and pass over. As to the rest of the people willingly remaining with Satan’s organization, they must feel the great tribulation. The ruling factors of that organization, acting by the will and power of Satan, hold the “sea” in control and use it. God’s hottest anger or wrath is against such ruling factors, that exploit the people and carry on their merchandise on the “sea”. After Armageddon there shall be “no more sea”. (Rev. 21: 1) But in that war salvation comes to those people on God’s side, and the victory in the great battle is with Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many centuries Jehovah has kept his war equipment out of sight and has given Satan full opportunity to make good his boastful challenge of JehovAh God, but at Armageddon there will be a complete change and Jehovah’s forces will be fully revealed. “Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes [of spiritual Israel], even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.” (3: 9) “With rivers thou dost cleave open the land.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font6">In the past Jehovah has done such a thing literally. (Pss. 78:15,16; 105: 41; Isa. 48:21) At Armageddon he will do such again, even on a far greater scale. Even now Jehovah has opened up channels for his Word of truth and caused it to flow as waters through ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’; and thus notice and warning have been served upon Satan’s earthly ruling groups and those under them. The people of good will, or ‘ Jona-dabs’, are being reached by these refreshing waters of truth and are thereby being divided or separated from Satan’s organization. But at Armageddon the splitting or cleavage of the literal earth will cause the worldly-wise and their cruel allies to go literally blind and frantic with fear and rage, and those that now make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses will then fight among themselves as did the Midianites. (Judg. 7:22) In the mighty, spectacular conflict then the literal earth will be split with rivers flowing out from such cleavages, and the peoples will be divided and split away from one another and will blindly fight one another, and, above all, Jehovah’s invisible armies under Christ will smite the enemy to death, both the visible and the invisible hosts thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The mountains saw thee, and they trembled.” The lofty and exalted government rulers of earthly institutions will see it is Jehovah God against whom they have arrayed themselves in battle, and that now their end is come; and, knowing that it is Jehovah’s power that is being exercised against them, they shall shake and tremble with great fear. “The overflowing of the water passed by”; that is, “the tempest” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.),</span><span class="font6"> “a downpour of waters hath passed along.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> The overflowing and victorious armies of Jehovah under Christ’s leadership will flow by and overflow and destroy the enemy. “The deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.” (3: 10) According to the Hebrew for “the deep” the picture is one of roaring and high waves, denoting either very high winds or undersea earthquakes causing a tidal wave. The deepest part of the ocean yet ascertained is the Emden deep, off the coast of Mindinao, Philippine Islands, and that vicinity is noted for tidal waves and great storms. Such a thing on far more tremendous proportions must come to pass at Armageddon, and would cause the deepest part of the sea to be greatly disturbed. This would indicate that the people most completely alienated from God by reason of the Devil’s influence will at Armageddon be terribly shaken. But Jehovah’s power knows no limitation, and in the midst of all that storm, earthquake, trembling of tumult, God’s faithful remnant of witnesses will be safe, and he will preserve them.—Psalm 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The sun and moon stood still in their habitation.” The earth existed long before God brought forth the sun to give light by day, and the moon for light at nighttime. (Gen. 1: 16) It is within his power to take away the sun and the moon as he may will, and thus deprive earth of its light in the daytime as well as at the nighttime. That would cause pitch-darkness to envelop the earth, both in the eastern and in the western hemisphere, at the same time; and surely then would come to pass the prophecy, to wit, “I [Jehovah] . . . create darkness.” (Isa. 45:7) The three days’ darkness in all ancient Egypt foretells the greater darkness coming over all the earth at Armageddon. (Ex. 10: 21-23) Jehovah’s mighty army will cause the enemy to quake and tremble in the darkness, but will itself not need to depend upon light of the sun, moon or stars. At that time Jehovah can, and, it seems certain, will, produce other lights of such brilliancy as to make even the sun seem dark in comparison. Imagine what will be the effect upon Satan’s earthly hosts under such conditions. “At the light of thine arrows they [Jehovah’s hosts] went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (3: 11) Symbolic of war equipment, arrows and spear, speeding with glittering light, would suggest shooting lights of fire or flames of fire, such as lightning or liquid fire, and every one of them making a center hit against the enemy organization. The forces of Christ Jesus, the great Warrior, -will be equipped with missiles that will shed light wheresoever they fly, and thus provide light when it is wanted and leave the enemy in darkness at other times. Thus Jehovah acts, taking the offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen [the nations (jE.V.)] in anger.” (3:12) The most terrible beating the Devil’s crowd will then receive at the hands of Jehovah’s organization, at the hand of the Lord. (Mic. 4: 11-13; Isa. 41: 15) It is his purpose to give terrible punishment to the forces of wickedness and thus make an end of them for ever, and they will never rise up again. (Nah. 1:9) Jehovah is always consistent. Therefore he could not save and give life to any that would refuse to trust in him and do his best to maintain integrity toward God. The Devil charged that none of the human race would remain faithful and true to Jehovah when put to the test. But some people will be faithful and true to him under the most trying circumstances, and in their behalf he will exercise his power, in the great battle. ‘ ‘ Thou wen test forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.”—3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Salvation” here does not mean to take the one crying to God from earth into heaven. It means the preserving of such alive upon the earth in the face of the murderous attempt of Satan and his agents to stamp out them and their work. Here then is another proof that some of God’s anointed remnant will pass alive through Armageddon, when, however, the nations shall be destroyed. Furthermore, God’s promise to the ‘Jonadabs’ is that if they will seek Jehovah and seek righteousness and meekness they too may be saved in like manner. (Zeph. 2: 2, 3) But Satan, the “head” of the lawless house or organization, will be wounded to death; likewise the “neck” next to him as head, to wit, Gog, Satan’s chief officer at Armageddon, will be destroyed. (Gen. 3:15; Ezek. 38,39) Jehovah will lay bare the entire organization of the enemy, from “foundation unto the neck”, bringing it into complete disgrace and thereby removing all doubts from all creation as to what constitutes the wicked organization in the universe. Then he tears it down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All parts of Satan’s organization, and particularly its chieftains, seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses now. In due time Jehovah disarms them and uses their own weapons to inflict punishment upon them. “Thou didst strike through with his [own] staves the head of his villages </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> his chiefs] ; they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me [Jehovah’s witnesses, foreshadowed by Habakkuk]: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly”; “in a secret place” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.).</span><span class="font6"> (3:14) ‘Secrecy’here seems clearly to mean secrecy on the enemy’s part to keep secret from others what they are doing and thus disguise their movement and keep honest people in ignorance of what is really being attempted against God’s people. But Jehovah knows every secret movement of the wicked crowd. He knows what the enemy is doing, and bids his faithful ones, the “poor in spirit”, to be patient and wait upon him until his due time comes to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font6"> through the mud] of great waters.” (3:15) The seas of the enemy cannot retard the onward march of Jehovah’s victorious warriors. (Ps. 93:4) Satan and his crowd have misused the natural or physical seas. That wicked one, who has alienated the symbolic seas from God, claims them for himself. (Ezek. 29:3) They do not belong to him nor to Big Business, but to Jehovah. (Ps. 95:5) At Armageddon God can and will walk through the “seas” according to his will, and nothing can prevent him. Even now Jehovah will have his witness work done to completeness, according to his will, and all opposition thereto shall not succeed. He has given to his people whom he has selected for his name a message, and he will see to it that they deliver it. “I am the Lord [Jehovah] thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The Lord [Jehovah] of hosts is his name. And I have put my words in thy [the remnant’s] mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion [mine organization], Thou art my people.”—Isa. 51:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After receiving the vision of the universal war God’s prophet says: “When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice [at the report]: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble ”; “ because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.).</span><span class="font6"> It requires a heart and mind strong of faith in Jehovah not to shrink back from the terrible and fearful days that arc just ahead; but Jehovah, by filling his faithful ones with a knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, gives them strength to continue boldly declaring his name and his kingdom. (Col. 1: 9-11) It is Jehovah’s fight, and his remnant know that he is right. So now they rest in faith and “sing aloud upon their beds” of ease. (Ps. 149:5) For “when he [the enemy] cometh up unto the people [of the Lord], he [Jehovah] will invade them with his troops”. (Hab. 3:16) Manifestly this means that when Satan’s officer Gog begins his assault, Jehovah will invade Gog’s visible and invisible forces and will cut the enemy’s forces to pieces. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font6"> Gog’s assault must and will fail completely. That will mark the fulfillment of the prayer-song of Habakkuk. That song God’s remnant now sings. They continue to sing, waiting with patience for the coming of the day when Jehovah God will completely wreck the enemy organization in the universal war at Armageddon.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark17"></a>FARMS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font6">ANY are writing the Society concerning farms and the operation of the same. In answer thereto this is to advise that the Society is not talcing possession of or operating farms. Certain arrangements have been made to procure farm produce to be used by the Bethel family that it may be fed in the most economical manner, but aside from that‘the Society is making no arrangements about farms. The Society is organized and commissioned by the Lord God to preaeh the gospel, and that is its work. Some of the Lord’s people have joined together to get possession of lands and establish homes and operate farms for their general good, but that is done aside from the supervision of the Society and is not under the control of the Society. The Society is pleased, however, to co-operate in helping persons to find places on farms or in camps so they can engage in the service and at the same time produce the things necessary for their physical welfare. All will please take notice that no one is authorized to solicit contributions in any manner in the name of the Society or for any purpose aside from placing the literature. Pioneers, auxiliaries and company workers should see to it that they receive their instructions from the Society’s office at Brooklyn, and from no one else; and no one outside of the Society’s office in Brooklyn is authorized to make any arrangements concerning the Society’s work or for the assignment of territory or for reports concerning the same. All who are devoted to the Lord are at unity, and there must be unity of action in order to be pleasing to the Lord, and there cannot be unity of action if directions are given from more than one place.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S ANSWERS GIVE STRENGTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greetings in the name of Jehovah. A strong desire has come over nie to express my gratitude to you as Jehovah’s witness, even, while deep down in my heart I daily thank Jehovah God and Jesus Christ for loving-kindness towards his faithful people at this time. My heart is made glad and greatly strengthened in faith and courage through all the means Jehovah has provided in order that we may so effectively sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> ranks high above all. I have enjoyed them all as far back as 1903, but words simply fail me to tell you how I enjoyed the articles “Seeking Knowledge’’, in the May and June issues. More to follow?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How true, “And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.” (Hab. 2: 2) Jehovah’s answers always give satisfaction and strength. “I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth. ’ ’ Vindicated be his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in kingdom service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">NO QUESTION AS TO ITS ORIGIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have just concluded our study of the Gideon articles and desire to express to you our keen appreciation of the wonderful and strengthening food contained in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> So mighty is the flow of the stream of truth that there can be no question as to its origin in the temple of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Praying the Lord's continued blessing upon you as you daily go forth to serve him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brethren by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bethel Family, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Strathfield, N. S. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">EVIDENCE OF GOD’S VISIBLE ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I feel so grateful for the provision that you had made for the pioneers to attend the Washington convention that I cannot refrain from writing to you and expressing my appreciation of your love for the Lord and his army. Your boldness and fearlessness in showing up old Jeiebel was a great stimulus to all of us to fear the Lord only and let Satan and his. cohorts do their worst. Old Jezebel has not been able, to reorganize herself since. Only the Lord could have supervised this convention, and that is evidence enough to any honest person that this is the Lord’s visible organization in the earth. I want to be found faithful serving and joyfully responding with you for whatever the Lord has for his people to the end. With warmest heartfelt love in the Lord, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in his service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John Boucher, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GREAT BLESSING “THESE MILES AWAY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although I know that your correspondence must be very great, and your time fully occupied, I feel I must send a few lines to tell you of the great blessing received from hearing your address “Government” from Washington, all these miles away, With the exception of one or two small fade-outs it came through wonderfully; and when the ‘ ‘ Aye ’ ’ came through from that vast audience, I too rose to my feet and joined them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I thank Jehovah God daily for your fearlessness and boldness in this his day of judgment, and I do ask for grace and strength to follow you, as you follow Christ. With warm love, and asking the Lord’s blessing on you and all in responsible positions in the body, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in the vindication of Jehovah’s name,</span></p>

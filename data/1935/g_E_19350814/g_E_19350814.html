<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible and Human Relations</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH GOD made provision for the marriage of man and woman. Marriage is therefore a divine institution, and questions relating thereto should be settled according to the rule of the Bible, the written Word of Jehovah God. Jehovah first made man and then declared: ‘It is not good for man to be alone. I will make him a help-meet for him.’ He made a woman and brought her unto the man. In other words, God made the man and woman and brought them together that they might enter into the marital relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since then no flesh and blood relationship between any man and woman as man and wife has been closer, for Adam married a creature of whom he said: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” (Genesis 2:23,24) There is nothing in the record, indicating that when God made man and woman and brought her to the man a ceremony was performed. Manifestly it was impossible for any man to perform such a ceremony at that time, for the reason that Adam was the only man on earth and Eve was the only woman. (1 Corinthians 15:45-47) “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”— Genesis 1:28.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Cain's Wife</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It is manifest that for God’s command to Adam and Eve to be obeyed it was necessary for their sons and daughters to intermarry; brothers must marry sisters. And they did. Sometime after Adam and Eve were driven from the garden of Eden children were born to them, who grew to the estate of manhood and womanhood, and they in turn had children. “Adam . . . begat sons and daughters: and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years.” (Genesis 5:4,5) The record concerning the birth of children to Adam and his -wife is brief. It does not claim to give the names of all their children. Cain is the first one named, and Abel the second. It is certain, however, that other children were born, both male and female, and lived contemporaneously with Abel and Cain. Doubtless both of these men were heads of families. The Scriptures specifically state that Cain had a wife; and she must have been one of Adam’s children, and therefore the sister of Cain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After murdering Abel “Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden”. (Genesis 4:16) Cain’s wife, one of the daughters of his father Adam, went with him to that land. Contrary to uninformed popular opinion, the Bible does not say or even allow that Cain found him a wife in the land of Nod. But, after relating Cain’s flight to Nod, it merely says: “And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.” Despite such a close marriage, the Bible shows that Cain’s offspring were not idiots and cripples and terribly diseased; for some of them were the original inventors and teachers of arts and sciences that have come down to us today. Cain’s great-grandson Jabal was an active fellow, always on the move, he being the first of those dwelling in tents, and a herdsman; whereas his brother Jubal “was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ”, and another great-grandson, Tubal-cain, was “an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”. (Genesis 4: 21, 22) Evidently this was so because the stream of the human family, now flowing, was not yet so far along on its descent from its once perfect source Adam, and hence</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was not yet so polluted and corrupted and unbalanced as in the days of the prophet Moses, over two thousand years later, when God saw it good and timely to give a law making it illegal for His people to contract such close marriages. (Leviticus 18:1-30) Thus it was that that man of faith, Abraham, whom God counted righteous, married his half-sister; for, said Abraham, “she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.”—Genesis 20:12.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Bigamy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Lamech was the great-great-great-grandson of Cain. “And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.” (Genesis 4:19) This is the first record of polygamy or of a man’s having more than one wife at the same time. But the Bible says nothing in condemnation of Lamech’s course. True, Jehovah made just one woman, one wife, for the first man Adam, and doubtless had the human family continued in sinlessness and perfection, this would have been the rule for all human creatures. Also Noah and his three sons had each but one wife when they went into the ark for safety from the great flood. (Genesis 7:13) Nevertheless, undue, harsh and sarcastic criticism has been maliciously leveled at the Bible, and thereby great reproach has been heaped upon the name of Jehovah God, because of the polygamy practiced by faithful men of God in times of old; and the Bible has been classed by self-righteous worldlings of superfine “religious susceptibilities” and “moral sensibilities” as being “not fit to have around the house lest the children should get hold of it and read in it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Was it wicked, immoral, unclean and illegal for Abraham to have a wife and a concubine, and for his grandson Jacob to have several wives, and also for other servants of the Lord likewise? That is wicked, immoral and illegal which the expressed law of Jehovah God forbids and condemns. From the time of man’s transgression in Eden until the time of Jesus and His apostles there is no law recorded in the Bible as given of Jehovah God restricting a man as to number of wives. Rather Jehovah’s law given in connection with His covenant with the children of Israel at Mount Sinai recognized the having of a number of wives at the same time, allowed it, and made special provisions respecting it, for instance, as to rights of inheritance of children born to the several wives of a man. (Deuteronomy 21:15-17) Shall mortal man, then, take himself so seriously today as to think he is more moral, more just, more righteous than Jehovah God, who is the only Lawgiver and the supreme Judge of all?—James 4:12; Hebrews 12:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Polygamy Abolished</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By virtue of the death of His dear Son Jesus on the tree on Calvary Jehovah God abolished the law covenant which He made with the Israelites and under which He authorized the practice of having several wives. Thus Jesus is spoken of, at Ephesians 2:15, as “having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace”; and, at Colossians 2:14, as “blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross”. Thenceforth the law of Jehovah God as applying to the footstep followers of His dear Son was as expressed by His apostle under inspiration at 1 Timothy 3:1, 2: “If a man desire the office of a bishop [not an ecclesiastical office, but simply the service of overseer], he desireth a good work. A bishop [overseer] then must be blameless, the husband of one wife.” Yet self-righteous men of today and the past ignore the foregoing Scriptural facts; and being brought up in so-called “Christendom”, which had adopted the law of monogamy as stated by the apostle, such conceited men misapply this law to God’s servants of pre-Christian times and thus condemn God’s holy men of old and reproach and ridicule His name and at the same time justify themselves as righteous and moral and self-contained. For the benefit of all such Jesus said: ‘Te are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.”—Luke 16:15.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Covenants Illustrated</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that Abraham had a wife and concubine at the same time was not condemned of God, but was used of Jehovah to illustrate that He would make a number of covenants. Jehovah took Abraham from the land of Ur of the Chaldees and to Canaan, and there to Abraham He made the declaration of His purpose (His covenant), to wit: “Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12:1-3) This is an unconditional promise that Jehovah himself will bless all obedient ones of the human race.—See Genesis 15:18; 22:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites, were in Egypt by the permission of Jehovah, and when the time came to deliver them from their oppressors in Egypt Jehovah made a covenant with them. Leading that people by the hand of Moses to Mount Sinai, Jehovah confirmed or inaugurated there His law covenant, which is in the Scriptures sometimes called “the old covenant”. (2 Corinthians 3:14, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version) </span><span class="font7">“And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: . . . Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine, And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” (Exodus 19: 3, 5, 6) “And he [Moses] took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said: All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient. And Moses took the blood [of sacrificial victims there slain], and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.”—Exodus 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All covenants made by Jehovah toward man are made for the primary purpose of vindicating His name. They are called Jehovah’s covenants because He is the originator and maker of them, and He takes others into His covenants as it pleases Him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Abrahamic, Law and New Covenants</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Abrahamic covenant is an unconditional promise of Jehovah to produce by His organization Zion (symbolized by His “woman”) a seed by or through which all the families of the earth may have an opportunity for the blessing of life; the primary purpose of which covenant is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The “seed” of that covenant is Christ, who is the Savior and Redeemer of man and the Vindicator of Jehovah God’s name. That covenant is unchangeable because bound by the word and oath of Jehovah. ■—Hebrews 6:13-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the abounding of transgression or sin against God’s law, Jehovah added to the Abrahamic covenant the law covenant, made in Egypt with Moses as mediator; and that covenant served as a schoolmaster to lead the teachable ones of Israel to Christ, the “seed” and Vindicator, and that covenant was continued until the coming of Christ. (Galatians 3:19-25) The purpose of the law covenant was to produce a people for the name of Jehovah; hence the primary purpose thereof was the vindication of Jehovah’s name.—2 Samuel 7: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Jeremiah 31: 31-34 Jehovah God foretold the making of a new covenant. The new covenant was made in the place and stead of the old law covenant. The purpose of the new covenant was not for the salvation of men, but for selecting a people for the name of Jehovah; which people so selected must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah; and, proving faithful therein, these participate with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The new covenant was made with Christ Jesus at the time of His death, and He is the Mediator thereof.—Matthew 26:26-28; Hebrews 9:14,15; 12: 24.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The Connection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Now, what connection has the foregoing with the fact that Abraham “the friend of God” had —what seems offensive to the self-righteous moral standards of many in “Christendom” today—a wife and a concubine ? This: The apostle Paul says: “For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman; but he that was of the bondmaid after the flesh had been born, whereas he that was of the free woman through means of a promise. Which things indeed may bear another meaning; for the same are two covenants, one indeed from Mount Sinai into bondage bringing forth, the which is Hagar, and the Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she answereth, however, unto the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children; but the Jerusalem above is free, the w<sup>T</sup>hich is our mother.”—Galatians 4:22-26, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immediately following the above the apostle quotes from the prophecy of Isaiah 54:1, showing that Sarah, Abraham’s wife, represented God’s organization called Jerusalem which is above and pictured by His “woman”. Abraham’s relationship to his wife and to his concubine Hagar and to his later concubine Keturah illustrated God’s relationship to His covenants, which covenants are a means employed to accomplish His purpose of getting a name for himself. Sarah and her son together illustrate or picture the unconditional covenant that Jehovah made that He would produce '‘the seed”. This seed of promise is foreshadowed by Isaac, Abraham’s son by Sarah, but the true “seed” is Christ Jesus. Hagar and her son Ishmael allegorically represented or pictured the law covenant, which God attached to His original promise made to Abraham. The purpose thereof was to furnish natural Israel an opportunity to produce a people for His name; but that covenant failed by reason of the fact that Israel was made up of imperfect human creatures. This failure of the covenant is illustrated in the fact that Hagar’s son was “born of the flesh”. What the la-w covenant failed in the new<sup>7</sup> covenant furnishes, to wit, a people for His name, Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Abrahamic covenant w’as in fact an unconditional declaration of Jehovah’s purpose to produce a seed, and by using Abraham and Sarah his wife God pictured how He would bring forth a seed, which seed was pictured or illustrated by Isaac. God permitted Sarah to be barren for a long while and until His due time to bring forth the typical seed of promise, Isaac. During that period of time Hagar was substituted for Sarah or attached to the Abrahamic household that she might give birth to an heir to Abraham. (Genesis 16:1-4) The son of Hagar was not the heir of promise (Genesis 17:15-22; 21:1-12); and manifestly the chief purpose of this arrangement was to demonstrate that the 'promised seed’ could be produced only by the miraculous power of Jehovah. In due time Sarah gave birth to the typical seed, Isaac, and this was the result of the exercise of Jehovah’s miraculous pow’er. The birth of that son W’as a confirmation of the covenant. Isaac was a type of Jesus Christ, the Son of Jehovah God, and who is the promised “seed”.—Galatians 3:16.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Bible Justifies No Immorality</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Any man who would seize upon the historic events recorded in the Bible as a justification or excuse for pursuing an indecent or immoral course would show that he has no faith in God and does not believe His Word and has no desire to obey Him. There is nothing in God’s Word that furnishes any excuse or justification for man or woman to do that which is immoral, improper and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The accounts in the Bible of the most intimate relations between certain men and women w<sup>r</sup>ere written not for the purpose of furnishing breezy stories or snappy stories for the entertainment of the foul-minded of today. They were not recorded with a salacious or suggestive intent, nor do they mar the beauty or purity of the Bible as “dead flies [which] cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour”. (Ecclesiastes 10:1) Concerning the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi the Lord Jesus in prayer to God said: “Thy word is [the] truth.” (John 17:17) And so it is that the written Word of God sets forth the pure unvarnished truth, for the lovers of fact and truth, and not for those of touchy “religious susceptibilities”. “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.” (Psalm 33:4) And as for the Bible’s needing to be expurgated or censored or revised because otherwise it is (as the evil-minded consider) “not fit for children to read”, the apostle Paul writes to Timothy concerning the aforesaid sacred books of the Bible and says: “From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”—2 Timothy 3:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The words of the Lord are pure words.” (Psalm 12: 6) The record of Lot and his two daughters is the simple, plainly stated truth, showing the origin of the two nations of Moab and Ammon and the dire conditions which produced them, and that hundreds of years before the “ten commandments” were given from Mount Sinai and to the prophet Moses. (Genesis 19: 30-38) Was the apostle Peter inspired to condemn the man Lot ? 2 Peter 2: 7, 8 reads: “And [God] delivered </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">just</span><span class="font7"> Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; (for that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">righteous </span><span class="font7">man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conduct of the woman Tamar, recorded in Genesis 38, is in full harmony with the law of levitate marriage, as expressly stated by Jehovah God several hundred years later in His covenant with Jacob’s descendants in the plains of Moab. (Deuteronomy 25:5-10) “Unto the pure all things are pure.” (Titus 1:15) “Jehovah seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.” (1 Samuel 16: 7, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> It could not be right to criticize the Word of God or the course of action taken by certain ones on record therein merely to please the fancy of some imperfect man or to maintain what is claimed to be the world’s standard of wisdom, purity and righteousness. The clergy have criticized much of God’s Word, that they might make themselves to appear holy, wise, pure and great, and that they might receive the commendation of other men. It is better to trust the Lord God, who never makes a mistake, and to know that what He directs is pure, holy, and righteous. “It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.” (Psalm 118: 8) In their attempt to make themselves appear as upholding the world’s standard of purity they have made themselves ridiculous in the sight of God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Ruth and Boaz</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Take, for instance, the Bible drama of the beautiful Moabitish woman, Ruth, who forsook her native land in order to return with her mother-in-law Naomi to Bethlehem, the future birthplace of King David and of Jesus Christ. God’s law made provision for a levirate marriage, and Ruth, by washing and anointing herself, and dressing for the occasion of going down to the threshingfloor and lying at the feet of Boaz, a kinsman by marriage, was preparing to be taken by Boaz as his wife by a levirate marriage that very night, and that w’ithout the necessity of some sanctimonious and pious-faced, hypocritical preacher’s being present to perform the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scoffers and critics have made much over this, claiming it to be an act of gross indecency. Such, however, have manifested a greater desire for the approval of men than to have an understanding of and to do the will of God. The course advised by Naomi, and which was taken by Ruth, was merely a formal way of serving notice upon Boaz, and of showing Ruth fully submissive to God’s arrangements, and Boaz, being a godly man, so understood it. Naomi, Ruth and Boaz were all devoted to Jehovah God, and, knowing this fact, Naomi did not hesitate in saying to Ruth that ‘Boaz will tell you what to do’. (Ruth 3:1-4) The coming of Ruth to Boaz in the field in the manner directed by Naomi well pictures the willing submission and unselfish devotion to the Lord by those who seek to know and to do His will.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Purpose of Marriage by Substitute</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s purpose in the law of levirate marriage was that the fruit should be brought forth, that is to say, that the fruit of the body might be brought forth in the lineage leading up to King David and, in due time, to Jesus, God’s mighty King. Naomi knew, from Genesis 49:10, that the Law-giver must come from the tribe of Judah, of which she was a member, and of which Boaz was also a member, and she was anxious to perform the part that God had assigned to her whether she understood it or not. She was too old to offer herself to Boaz to raise up a child, and therefore she offered her daughter-in-law; and this without doubt she did under Jehovah’s direction. In like manner barren Sarah offered Hagar to Abraham; and also Rachel, because of her barrenness, offered her handmaid Bilhah to Jacob. (Genesis 16:1-3; 30:1-5) Naomi did not want the opportunity lost for a child to be of the royal house, and the only way to avoid that loss was to substitute Ruth for herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The later action of Boaz was strictly in compliance with the law. (Deuteronomy 25:7) This does not mean that those other than the Israelites were then or now to comply with the law of levirate marriage. God’s law was given to Israel, His covenant people, and that law was for the purpose of foreshadowing greater things to come to pass. (Hebrews 10:1) The things which came to pass on the Israelites were typical of what would be due to come to pass at the end of the world. “So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and . . . she bare a son.” (Ruth 4:13) Thus Jehovah showed His approval to give Boaz and Ruth a son, looking to the vindication of His name and His Word that ‘out of the loins of Judah should come a Ruler and a Lawgiver’. It was not the physical power of aged Boaz and of Ruth that resulted in the birth of the son, because it was ‘God that gave the increase’. (1 Corinthians 3: 6) Even so it is Jehovah who now has brought forth the mighty One who shall rule all the nations of the earth and who shall be the Vindicator of His great name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus, every-way, the Word of God, the Bible, stands vindicated as pure, holy, honest, true, wholesome and correct and higher than the word of creature man, and shall endure for ever.— Isaiah 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N ACCORD with the intimation given through the public press by government officials the Ontario government has canceled all contracts with the private power companies of Quebec, and in so doing has saved the people of Ontario tens of millions of dollars. Speaking editorially of these contracts the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font7"> of Toronto says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whereas Hydro users had every right to assume that their industry would be conducted, as Beck explained, without requiring them to pay the toll levied on patrons of private corporations, they now find they were sold out behind their backs. The contracts made in their name oblige them to pay profits and dividends— to pay even though they do not use the power—to pay such large profits that the promoters of each corporation, as soon as the contract was signed, were able to s411 tremendous blocks of securities to the public with the observation that Hydro customers in Ontario would more than pay the dividends. Fortunes were made for the promoters with a stroke of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real facts, long concealed, are now coming to light. On Tuesday night Mr. Roebuck stated that under these contracts the four Quebec power corporations will take $380,000,000 from the people of the Niagara district, an amount exceeding by $100,000,000 the entire capital investment of the Hydro in plant. They call for delivery of, and payment for, 916,000 horsepower, although the maximum demand for Niagara power last year was only 833,000 horsepower and the normal operating capacity of Hydro’s Niagara plants is 830,000 horsepower.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Ultra-Conservative Social Program</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking upon the subject of social legislation in Canada the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix,</span><span class="font7"> under the caption “Far Behind”, editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the program of social legislation was outlined to Canada by the prime minister, there has been considerable scrutiny of what other countries have done in this direction. The result of such an examination is that Canada is beginning to realize how far behind the parade it has been and still is. Even some of the South American republics are far ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 8-hour working day and 48-hour working week legislation is about fifteen years behind the times, it having been adopted by the International Labor Organization that long ago. That body is now drafting an agreement for a 40-hour week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unemployment insurance, now being enacted at Ottawa, has been in effect for twenty years and more in dozens of countries. European nations have had similar legislation since long before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">State sickness and accident insurance has been in effect in a number of countries for quite a while, and not a few have some form of old-age insurance scheme which provides pensions for the advanced years of its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently a representative of the International </span><span class="font7">La</span><span class="font6">bor Organization visited South America, and there he found a number of the republics have excellent social legislation of the kind Canada is now preparing to adopt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His report covers Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. In all four of those countries workmen’s compensation legislation is effective and satisfactory. In Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay there is a system of voluntary sickness insurance by mutual benefit societies. In Chile sickness and maternity insurance is compulsory for all workers and the Central Fund of the workers’ insurance system is active in organizing medical services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All four countries have old-age, widows’ and orphans’ insurance. In Chile these systems are compulsory to wage earners in industry, commerce and agriculture. In Uruguay they apply to workers in industry and commerce, but not agriculture. Brazil and Argentina have made them applicable to a large body of workers in industry and business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the report submitted to the International Labor Organization, legislation in these countries is quite advanced with substantial allowances and pensions paid. The funds are well organized and the administrative standard is said to be as high as in European countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems that Canada is merely catching up with the South American republics in this matter of social legislation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Comforting a Bereaved Ewe</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">A Canadian Press news item from Manitoba tells how a rancher solved his dilemma. It states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To George Heatley, who for thirty years has raised sheep successfully on his farm three miles west of here, a knowledge of the Old Testament comes in handy in his business. In fact, it’s part of his stock in trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of his ewes dropped twin lambs, and another triplets, recently. But both of the first ewe’s lambs died. Heatley took one of the triplets and gave it to the first ewe. The anguished mother would have nothing to do with it. George turned to the Bible in his dilemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He came to the Old Testament story of Esau and Jacob, which described how Rebekah ‘took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau and put them upon Jacob, her younger son, and put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck’, so that Isaac, feeling Jacob’s hands and smelling the smell of his raiment, took him for Esau and gave him his brother’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heatley skinned one of the dead lambs and pulled it like a sweater over the head of one of the triplets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The subterfuge worked, the bereaved mother welcoming ‘her’ lamb with open ‘arms’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">As one watches the ever increasing burden of national debts one cannot help but wonder how long the people can endure such terrible burdens. In Canada this debt upon every householder totals the large sum of over $3,300 apart from such private debts as mortgages. To give some idea of how rapidly these debts are increasing we quote from an editorial appearing in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font7"> of Toronto:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How far Ontario has traveled in the interval of thirty-one years since the last Liberal Budget was brought down in the Legislature is pointed out strikingly in the presentation by Hon. Mitchell F. Hepburn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rise in debt totals could scarcely have been imagined by those who heard Premier Ross deliver his Budget address on February 9, 1904. Such figures as these are startling:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1904 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1934</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Net debt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1,664,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;$358,476,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">of all property &nbsp;$897,000,000 &nbsp;$3,183,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An analysis which will be helpful in clarifying perspectives is presented in the statement of gross and net debt at the end of the successive political regimes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Net debt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gross debt Net debt per cap.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">An interesting passage in the Budget is devoted to the general position in municipal affairs in the province. The statement of obligations shows the following totals:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unmatured principal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$71,903,498</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Overdue principal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11,418,041</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total principal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,241,539</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Overdue interest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,972,350</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total outstanding principal and interest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$88,213,869</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Department of Municipal Affairs, established in September, 1934, has embarked, Mr. Hepburn remarks, on a program looking to improvement in municipal accounting and auditing, and he comments upon the contemplated measures which will give wider control over municipalities seeking special powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By reason of the shifting of the end of the fiscal year from October 31 to March 31, this year’s statement embodies an unusual feature: an interim statement for the five-month period. Here ordinary expenditure totals $34,250,028, as compared with ordinary revenues of $26,800,794, a deficit of $7,449,233.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The comparative statement of Budget ordinary revenue (March 31,1936) and actual ordinary revenue (October 31, 1934) shows an interesting net increase of $9,717,685. On the expenditure side of the table a net decrease of $4,396,256 is revealed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Comments on Canadian Hate Bill</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">To give some idea of how far the Devil will go to muzzle freedom of speech in his effort to hold his empire together, we quote the following news item from Ottawa:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Michael Luchkovich, U.F.A. member for Vegreville, today introduced a bill in the House of Commons designed to make it an offense to utter defamatory words against any race, nationality or creed represented in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His bill, Mr. Luchkovich explained before the House met, “is designed to create better feeling among the races in Canada.” He would gain his object through an amendment to the criminal code saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Everyone who utters, prints, publishes, circulates or otherwise disseminates any defamatory matter reflecting upon any person or body of persons of any race or religion tending to degrade, revile or expose them to hatred, injury, insult or contempt among the people is guilty of an offense.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bill was given first reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fourth column of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consumer s’ Gas </span><span class="font7">contains the following interesting comment upon this proposed legislation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A member of Parliament proposes a bill which would make it a crime to speak in a defamatory way of any race or religion. Behind it is the idea that everybody has a right to his own racial or religious prejudices, and that to disturb them is to invite a breach of the peace. If we are not mistaken, the author of this measure is a member of whom we have spoken favorably in the past. The bill makes it unlikely that we shall ever make the same mistake in the future. It is well meaning, but vicious. Under the guise of promoting and maintaining brotherly feelings it aims a blow at free speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have never been beguiled by the theory that because every man has a right to believe what he likes another man should be forbidden to say that what the first man likes to believe is silly or dangerous or antisocial. The right of a man to believe does not supersede the right of another man to believe that he is in error, and if the matter is to be discussed, to say so. Irreparable damage to human souls and the progress of civilization has been wrought under the guise that it would be shameful to deprive a man of his beliefs. Time was when men believed that a salve would cure cancer, or that some superstitious incantations, embodied in a religion, would guarantee a fruitful marriage. It was in the public interest that such sacred beliefs should be blown up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We speak as a Canadian when we say that anybody in this country ought to be free to say that Canadians are no good, and as a nominal Christian when we say that people who do not believe in Christianity ought to be permitted to continue their missionary efforts to wean us from it. Races and religions that cannot withstand the kind of criticism that they are exposed to in this country are not worth preserving.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>High Auto Costs in Canada</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">With the high tariff wall against manufactured goods’ coming into Canada from the United States causing among other things the Canadian people to pay approximately 50 percent more for cars than their American cousins, it is high time the matter was investigated. Concerning this spread the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix </span><span class="font7">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spread in the prices of automobiles as between Canada and the United States is something on which there has been a lot of quiet thinking by prospective or possible car purchasers but about which there has been little discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The announcement from Ottawa that the tariff board has been requested to investigate the spread and its causes should, therefore, be satisfactory to the public and not at all disturbing to those who make and sell cars in Canada. And the inquiry should clear the air considerably, correct any wrong impressions and bring to the fore a number of factors which are frequently not taken into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This, of course, is quite to be desired. It is safe to say that both the buying public and the makers of cars want the business to be on a fair basis, and the only way to arrive at such a basis, and satisfy everyone concerned, is by a close public examination of the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is generally believed that prices in Canada are much too high when compared with those in the United States. It is usually pointed out that a car which is advertised across the line at, say, $500 or $1,000 costs several hundreds more in Canada, the exact amount depending on point of sale. Certainly figures arrived at in this way are enough to arouse bitter criticism, but it is a rather casual and careless comparison. The situation calls for more exact analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But one or two things should be pointed out even before such an inquiry begins. One is that a comparison of this type leaves out of account the matter of freight rates. The prices set opposite each other should be for comparative points in each country, that is, points equidistant from the place of manufacture. That makes a very considerable difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another angle is that of the trade-in value of the used car. The amount allowed in the United States on a trade-in is said to be ridiculously smaller than that allowed in Canada. The higher amount in this country does not, of course, help the man buying his first car, or who has no car to trade in, but it makes a very considerable difference to the car owner renewing his transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether or not this trade-in difference is sufficient to offset the price spread is a matter which calls for study such as only the tariff board can give. If it does, then the man who is renewing his transportation will probably not be greatly affected by any change in prices in Canada. As the price of a new car drops the allowance on his old one will be reduced correspondingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But certainly the new buyer has to pay a decided spread. At the present time, after four years in which cars have been used longer than normally, and for some little time in the future, it is probable that the new buyer, or individual without a ear to trade in, will be a larger factor in car sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are points worth keeping in mind, and there may be many more of equal importance on both sides of the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The appearances are most distinctly that there is a difference in prices unwarranted by costs of production and made possible by tariffs. That is the opinion generally accepted by the public, and the appearances are sufficient to warrant a thorough public inquiry by the tariff board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Armchair Generals and Their Ties</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same paper, under the caption &quot;Saved Again”, makes the following comment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada has been saved again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once more the military forces, or at least the higher command, have risen to the occasion, have sprung into the breach, and by supreme wisdom and exquisite tactical judgment have prevented the worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The news comes from Ottawa. It is that at long last the great controversy over the exact size and shape of ties for military dress uniform has been settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems there have been differences of opinion on this question, but with that amazing genius for concealment of their thoughts, which characterizes the higher command, no word of the danger has seeped out to alarm the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was rapidly coming to a crisis which, if permitted to develop, might have disturbed the peace of the country and disrupted the defensive forces. And then what an opportunity there would have been for the Communists!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indeed, perhaps it was all a dirty Communist plot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the danger was met boldly. The armchair generals constituting the board of strategy at General Headquarters were undismayed. They called in their sartorial experts. They studied the terrain of the shirt-front and the monkey-jacket. They examined the upper reaches for a jumping-off point and finally launched their attack up the exposed glacis of the Adam’s apple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a complete success. The deviators were put to rout and the question settled for all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But it is remarkable, when the thing came up for discussion in the House of Commons, that Miss Agnes Macphail did not seize the opportunity for an antiwar utterance. She might have dealt forcefully-with the brutality of war and the horrors of a deviating dress tic.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Very Low Military Costs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire,</span><span class="font7"> speaking of the “Great Military Power” of Canada, states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every year when the estimates for the Militia Department come before Parliament there are repetitions of what one member called “a protest against the enormous expenditures which are being made in Canada for military purposes”. Dr. Manion neatly spiked the guns of the objectors a few evenings ago when he presented the following table giving the present cost per head in various countries for defense purposes: Canada, $1.24; New Zealand, $1.50; Denmark, $2.18; South Africa, $2.20; Australia, $2.40; Japan, $3.70; Belgium, $4.10; United States, $5.60; Switzerland, $6.00; Italy, $8.00; Great Britain and Northern Ireland, $9.50; France, $14.80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada is the lowest in the world. Even Switzerland spends $6 per head, though it must be centuries since she was at war. Yet Canada, with an expenditure of $1.24, is talked about as if she were getting ready for war. “I am sure,” remarked Dr. Manion ironically, “all nations are trembling as to what we shall do with this great military power of ours.”</span></p>

Fifty-six percent of American planes are capable of cruising at 160 miles an hour or more, while there are but 33 planes in use in Europe faster than 125 miles an hour. In America, on the average, one may fly seven and a quarter million miles before having to take matters up with his undertaker, but in Britain they come for him after he has flown but two and a quarter million miles.</span></p>

Suction pulls the machine upward and onward. The French government is developing the machine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Public Ownership Is Wrong</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font7">ITTLE by little the public is learning why it is all right for them to own and operate sewers, pavements, police departments, fire departments, hospitals, etc., where all is outgo, and why it is all wrong for them to own and operate gas and electric plants and other public utilities, where the funds come in every month, regular as clockwork, and the things the people must have are charged to them at three times the price that would be fair. Thus, it would be all wrong for the California public to own their gas and electric plants. If they did, somebody would holler “Bloody murder!” at the idea of paying President Hockenbeamer $70,000 a year; others would holler at paying fifty-seven other officials, engineers, attorneys and managers over $5,000 per year each; and still others would holler at the contribution of $15,523 to the so-called “Edison Electric Institute”, under which high-toned name the Power Trust now operates its propaganda against public ownership of public utilities. Somebody would be sure to make a row about $8,139 going to the California Taxpayers Association, than which no name could be more misleading; and some other victim would complain about a contribution of $7,521 to the California State Chamber of Commerce. This is the situation all over California, all over America, and nearly all over the world, but not quite. So it seems that the big officials are not interested in their huge salaries, not at all, but their eagerness to turn over to the public little things like garbage and ashes collections and to keep for themselves such things as gas, water and electric utilities, is because they want the people to dwell together in peace. Ah! That is it! “Blessed are the peacemakers,” the utility gang. And what about the people? Oh, the people! Well, “the people can be damned.” No, Clementine, they do not say that aloud, but that is the idea.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font7">ARGELY as a result of the constant hammering by a few honest editors, the electric light and power companies have been cutting their rates, with the perfectly natural result that might have been expected; the year 1935 opened up with 20,520,870 persons in the United States using electricity in their residences, which is more than ever before in the history of the country. The rates still need to be greatly reduced in order to provide the people with more opportunities to use this blessing, and in the end it will work out better, and does work out better, for the electric companies themselves. Engineers now claim that steam electric generation is cheaper than water.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE people are in great distress and in need of comfort. Jehovah is the Father of mercy and God of all comfort. (2 Corinthians 1: 3) He provides comfort for them through a knowledge of His Word. When the people are fully convinced that oppression will end and that the blessings of peace and prosperity are certain and are near, that knowledge will bring comfort to those that mourn. Jehovah’s witnesses are endeavoring to aid the people to gain a knowledge of the truth that will comfort them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why is there so much poverty, suffering and distress among all the peoples of the earth ? The Scriptures answer that question in these words: 'Because the Devil has come down to earth and is gathering all the nations to the battle of Armageddon, seeking their destruction.’ (Revelation 12:12; 16:13-16) For many centuries Satan the Devil has been the invisible ruler of the world; and now the end of his rule has come and he knows that the time is short until the final war must be fought, and he hastens to drive all the people to despair that they might turn away from God and be destroyed. Jesus said that at the end of Satan’s world the people would be in distress and perplexity; and it is even so now, because we have reached the end of the world.—Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now learn the truth and receive comfort. Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, has come. Soon He will completely destroy Satan’s oppressive organization and set the people free. Just before that work of great destruction the Lord sends forth faithful men and women to be His witnesses and to inform the people of God's gracious provision for their blessing. Christ, now present, is dividing the peoples as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats; which Jesus himself illustrated by the parable. That separating work is being done by having the people informed of the truth, that they may intelligently decide whom they will serve. By His truth the Lord is now binding up the brokenhearted and giving comfort to those that mourn and who desire to see righteousness rule the world. A knowledge of the truth assures them that such blessings are near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soon Armageddon will be fought, resulting in complete destruction of Satan’s oppressive rule. Then trouble, suffering and sorrow will end. The Lord Jesus Christ as the invisible Ruler will rule the world in righteousness, and righteous men will represent Him on earth, and the righteous rule shall never end. Just now we are in the transition period from wicked rule to that of righteous government. Speaking of the blessings that shall come to the people soon under the rule of Christ Jesus, the Scriptures say (Psalm 72:4,7,12,17): “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon en-dureth. For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun; and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus has taught all good persons to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom, and now that prayer is about to be fulfilled. His kingdom will bring blessings far beyond the fondest imagination of men. The earth shall be filled with the glory of God, and all who desire righteousness and who obey the Lord shall dwell upon the earth forever in continuous peace and prosperity. God’s Word is true, and He will perform exactly what He has promised. Through His prophet He says: T have purposed it, and I will also do it.’ Learn the truth and be greatly comforted, and then pass that message of comfort on to your neighbor that he also may rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take note of some of the precious promises set forth in God’s Word and receive comfort therefrom: The people are now encompassed by enemies such as sickness, suffering and death, and by reason thereof the world is filled with sorrow. The Bible says (1 Corinthians 15) that under the reign of Christ all enemies, including death, will be destroyed. Those who obey the Lord shall be given life, and then the people will no longer be sick, as it is written in the Scriptures. The people being in good health and strong and happy, no more tears of sorrow will flow. In Revelation 21 it is written concerning the blessings of the Kingdom that God will wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, crying nor pain. Such are some of the blessings that Jehovah has in store for the people.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>Takes His Stand for Baal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">AID C. H. Stuart, in the Tampa </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Tribune:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Several days ago there appeared, in the space you so generously contribute to public opinion, a letter condemning as ‘public nuisance No. 1’ a certain class of people who invade our homes under the guise and pretense of being Jehovah’s special appointees. Mention was also made of the very eminent position assumed by these people through their bombastic vituperation of Christendom in general. Also the beclouded and veiled threats to all who would not accept their interpretation of the Scriptures as correct. I am in position to offer first-hand information concerning these ‘invasions’, for at one time I wasted much time in the dissemination of this ridiculous propaganda. This organization has men, of the ‘chosen’ variety, to make periodical visits to assemblies, not of this nation only, but throughout the earth, mind you; to drill and teach the best method of ‘approach’ and ‘salesmanship’. The proposition of major importance is ‘to sell your wares and bring in the money’. Where does the money go ? For more of the same stuff written by the same man, who arrogantly claims to be the greatest of all men since Christ and the apostles. People in general are easily frightened. Then, too, the vast majority know so little about the Bible they seldom dispute these extravagant assertions. Such a one does not exist in this present generation. Christ will attend to everything when he returns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing letter is published because it perfectly fits all the conditions which the Scriptures attach to the “evil servant” class. There is the admission that he once believed the Lord’s presence; the admission that now it is no longer believed; there is the smiting of fellow servants; there is the eating and drinking with those that stand for the abominations of “Christendom”. The Lord has cut him off; he has been given his portion with the hypocrites; and the screed in the Tampa </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Tribune</span><span class="font7"> is his “gnashing of teeth”. Nothing is missing. See the account in Matthew 24:48-51. The Lord continues His story about a wicked and slothful servant, in the next chapter; tells of his being cut off from the light of truth; tells of his weeping and gnashing of teeth; and finally tells of the “goats” that are cursed and sent into everlasting destruction prepared for the Devil and his angels. All this can now be plainly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholics Take Their Stand for God</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE following are from former Catholics in France and Italy, addressed to the Paris office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since I came back to Italy I have been busy making known the Truth and I continue to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom, thus accomplishing God’s will. The ecclesiastical papers here claim that Protestantism is increasing, and they warn their readers that the Bible is not sufficient. Notwithstanding great contradiction, by God’s grace I remain firm in the Truth, and, according to His promises, we shall be comforted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend W. R. Yard, pastor of the First Baptist church, Marshalltown, Iowa, seems to see what is ahead for him in the way of farm work or some other useful occupation, when, in a circular letter to his parishioners, he says: “If 75 percent of the church members have no vital interest in the churches of any community, do those churches any longer serve any real need, and might not the 25 percent about as well quit, too, and let the church die or go out of business ? If 60 percent of the members of our church have no real interest in any part of its work, would it not be as well for the other 40 percent to quit, turn out the 300 enrolled in the Bible school, and permit our church to die along with the rest?” As additional argument for permitting the church to expire and give him a chance at the farm work which the prophet Zechariah (in Chapter 13) suggests as an honorable substitute for the line of work which now engages his attention, Reverend Yard explains that he knows of 32 members of his church that have not attended his services in over eleven years, 52 rarely attend, and 109 attend only occasionally. If the “Reverend” will read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font7"> (Books One and Two), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> (Books One, Two and Three), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, Preservation, Jehovah, </span><span class="font7">any of them, he will understand why the farm yawns for him.</span></p>

I do not know why it is that awful diseases exist in the world.” He admitted he could not absolutely prove the existence of God, and wound up by saying, “I think that we ourselves have the privilege of doing our share to bring this world to perfection.” Now, there it is. He admits that the world is in a terrible condition; he doesn’t know if there is a God; but in the absence of any knowledge on the subject he and a few others will shortly put everything in apple-pie order and all will live happy ever after.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ttorney James E. Bennett, of Park Row, New York city, doesn’t want dances in the pulpits of Presbyterian churches and doesn’t </span><span class="font7">want missionaries in the field who don’t believe the Bible, but he is considered out of date and behind the times by those that are running the present Presbyterian church system. He has been asked to resign from the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. Indeed, he was directed to resign, but did not do so. And that has not hindered him from protesting against the dances of Miss Ruth St. Denis, who has been giving other Presbyterians a thrill by illustrating to them “the gradual ascent of man’s soul from the moment he acknowledges his need of spiritual light to the final radiation”. The final radiation, it may be explained, is that the 'radiated’ person doesn’t believe a word in the Bible from cover to cover, and doesn’t know one thing of what life is all about. Miss St. Denis says that “in the next five years dancing in church will become so common that there will be no criticism about it from the point of novelty”; and she may be right at that. Better sell your cabaret and vaudeville stock at once.</span></p>

Go into any one of the imposing palaces of religion any Sunday, and what do you find ? A bleak expanse of pews thinly populated by a few dozen nice old ladies, a smaller number of fine, elderly husbands who are present only as the result of wifely stress and compulsion, and a mere half-dozen of young people who have been dragged in by main strength and awkwardness. ’ ’</span></p>

The account says, in part: “Until two weeks ago [he] was assistant to the vicar of Holy Trinity church, Stepney. And all the 25 years he has been connected with the Church of England he has been longing for his own shop counter, his own bacon-cutting machine, and butter pats.” And so the reformation proceeds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(From </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Le Cathotique de L’Ain,</span><span class="font5"> France)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS a magnificent spectacle to see the superb position the Catholics have been able to acquire in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was not easy for them to make a place for themselves amongst the multitude of Protestant sects, all very hostile towards the “papacy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have made it by the exercise of patience, energy, loyalty, charity and discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their position today is invulnerable. They have conquered all calumnies, lies and prejudices. They have acquired the respect of all. It would be impossible to organize persecution against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And they make, unceasingly, numerous and often noble acquisitions. In the jumble of sects, in the uncertainty of beliefs, the Catholic church, by the firmness of its creed, the purity of its morale, its wonderful unity, the discipline of the faithful under the hierarchy, has acquired an incomparable prestige, a force of irresistible attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The American Catholics number more than twenty millions, are united, faithful, and proud of their faith. Their social w<sup>r</sup>orks, as hospitals, asylums, shelters, orphanages, libraries, laboratories, schools, universities, are models, everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The place they have acquired in the life of the church has become so important that the Holy See has elected, almost simultaneously, four American cardinals: Mgr. Hayes, archbishop of New York; Mgr. Mundelein, archbishop of Chicago; Mgr. O’Connell, archbishop of Boston; and Mgr. Dougherty, archbishop of Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And in national life they are always in the first rank. Amongst religious groups they are the most numerous, most active and the hardiest. They are at the head of all great activities, the fight against prohibition, against immoral cinemas, the fight for disarmament and peace for the nations, the campaign against religious persecution in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition, they balk at nothing in the way of progress, and draw back before no sacrifice; their bearing is neither humiliated nor provocative; they are just, they are “chic”. They have an immense influence in the great Republic, and it grows each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have never had a criticizing, grumbling attitude, always discontented, the attitude of defeat ill supported, living in an obsolete past, an attitude such as many French Catholics have never been able to quit. Instead of letting their eyes rest on a past of defeat, they fix them on a future of conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their souls are those of victors, hardy, happy, inviting, and, for that reason, they go from progress on to progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">NY man that would try to Jew down a seller of indulgences to less than one cent a day for keeping him out of a bonfire that otherwise would roast him to a piece of charcoal is certainly a piker and ought to be publicly exposed. It is with pleasure therefore that the following memorandum is reprinted. It originally accompanied a rosary and said: “This rosary is blessed with the Crozier Blessing, which means that an indulgence of 500 days is to be gained for each ‘Our Father’ and each ‘Hail Mary<sup>1</sup> recited on its beads. This indulgence, granted first by Leo X, is applicable to both the living and to the suffering souls. The heart which joins the chain is also specially blessed as a scapular medal, giving the one who carries the rosary, and has been once enrolled in the scapular, the advantages of indulgences bestowed on those who wear the scapular. These favors are not to be gained until the Five Dollars collected, or contributed, for the pious cause has been forwarded to the Sacred Heart Union, Arlington, N. J.” That’s nicely put; now, isn’t it? Everything is blessed all O.K. and you get the 500 days indulgence all O.K., but if you hold back on the five bucks, then the whole thing is no good, none at all, just so much junk, a false alarm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">BJECTING strenuously to the law which would require priests to disclose the whereabouts of murderers and thieves, the Right Reverend Monsignor D. G. Hunt, vicar-general of the Catholic diocese of Salt Lake, issued a statement in which he said: “Every man has the right to benefit of clergy. No matter how criminal he may be, he does not lose the right to pour out his troubles to a minister of religion in whom he has confidence, and to ask for help w’hich only a minister can give. Incidentally, the more criminal he is, the more urgently he needs to exercise this right.” He announced that “regardless of the statutes of any legislature” the priests would continue as heretofore.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>Catholics Not Interested in Their Press</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE following extract from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Messenger</span><span class="font7"> of June 15, 1935, indicates that Catholics generally have little confidence in Catholic papers. They seem to realize that these papers are published to further the interests of the hierarchy, and not to give out the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Washington,</span><span class="font6"> June 15.—There has been talk at the Catholic University from time to time,—all unofficial, and largely conjecture, of course,—about the possibilities of making the Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> a national Catholic daily. There are men who have such dreams. Nothing will ever be done about the fantasies, but, some pleasure is derived from speculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> for many reasons, could have been changed over into that long-dreamed-of Catholic daily, so it has been said. In its long history it has never been sensational and it has been generally fair to all creeds. [?] In the last national election it hammered the bigots while it supported the opponents of the candidate the bigots were attacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where the $3,000,000 necessary for the purchase of the paper could have been raised is a question. Unlike Christian Scientists, Catholics are not as a rule interested in their faith to the extent of investing in Catholic publications. Part of the fault rests with the individual members of the church, and part with the publishers. Be that as it may, the fact nevertheless remains that raising $3,000,000 would have been a task. Perhaps an impossible task. And what kind of a paper could it be under Catholic auspices? . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cistercian Order Doing a Good Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Cistercian Order, in care of the “Monastery of Our Lady of Spring Bank”, Okau-chee, Wis., seems to be doing a good business. Here is some of its advertising literature. The headlines are interesting: “Lend the Cistercian Order Money at Six Percent; Lend the Cistercian Order Money for Only Five Years; Lend the Cistercian Order Money on Ample Security; Lend the Cistercian Order Money for the Cause of God.” What do the people get back? Oh, they get bonds, in denominations of $1000, $500, $100, and $50. They can pay in installments, too, and the bonds are transferable. Just think of that. And they can be left in a will. Isn’t that generous? The same advertising literature tells how you can join the “Cistercian Perpetual Mass League”, by either sending in $10 in a lump sum or in parts, or $100 for an entire family of Pa and Ma and the eight kids. This may make it necessary for them to go without shoes, but the circular explains that Christ is hungry and they want to still the hunger of Christ, and if you loosen up and send them money, money, money, why, the hunger will be stilled. The literature refers to Him as the “Divine Babe”; and if you knew a “Divine Babe” was hungry, and would not let go of your wad to still his hunger, then you are hard-hearted and deserve to be kept awake at night when you want to sleep. Why should he be quiet if you don't pay?</span></p>

In Mieres, in a Catholic college known as Christian Doctrine College, an old established form of Inquisitional torture was re-established: prisoners’ wrists were tied together, a rope was slipped between the arms, and the rope was passed over a pulley, and the prisoners were hoisted in the air. Some were suspended for nine hours and now have both arms paralyzed; some suffered loss of speech. In one instance sixteen prisoners, whose names were not known, were taken from prison and their bleeding bodies thrown into a coal mine. To extort confessions men have been compelled to lie prostrate on the ground while soldiers clubbed them into submission. Women have been similarly clubbed. One man had every tooth knocked out by blows with a rifle-butt. Spain is once more fully under control of the Roman Catholic hierarchy.</span></p>

The latest, in New York, is the Holy Name Society of the hire Department. On April 28, 1935, 1,000 members of the Society had a so-called “communion” breakfast at the Hotel Astor, New York. This happened eight days after a big waterfront fire in Brooklyn at which 144 out of 411 firemen on the job were injured, and, most deservedly, were highly commended in the press.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stigmata Caused by Demons</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE demons have certain powers over the bodies of those who submit to them. They have been known to cause wounds somewhat similar to those believed to have been made in Christ’s hands and feet when nailed to the tree. The object is to dishonor God. The crucifixion of Christ, though not prevented by God, was the work of the Devil, and was done by the Devil’s agents. It was all permitted by the Higher Power and is for ever a thing of the past. Christ dieth no more. It was all right in Paul’s day for him to preach and talk of little else than “Christ and Him crucified”; today the great message of God’s people is the vindication of God’s name, though the Vindicator, to be sure, is that same One who was crucified so long ago. Live in the present. Do now the things God wishes you to do now.</span></p>

The worshipers are all absolutely nude. The center of each edifice is occupied by a gigantic urn adorned with the symbols of the zodiac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While this open worship of the Devil is comparatively rare among so-called “civilized nations”, a little reflection will show that those who will not worship and obey Jehovah God serve the Devil quite as fully as do those who go through the formal rites of his cult.</span></p>

After the equinox has passed she again becomes normal. The most reasonable explanation of this malady, said to have baffled 200 doctors, is that this is the work of demons, seeking to bring dishonor upon the great Creator at the turn of the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">America’s Huge Imports of Food—and Why</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Tom Linder is Commissioner of Agriculture of Georgia)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">ILLIONAIRE international bankers in this country loaned millions of dollars to foreign countries to promote war. In the war which followed, foreign countries bought from America many thousands of shiploads of everything from bayonets, with which to kill, to wheat, to eat, and medicine to treat the wounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In exchange for these supplies, shiploads of gold came from London, from Paris, from Rome and from Oriental nations. Nearly all the gold in the world was piled up in vaults in Washington and New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the gold was piled up in this country we shipped other thousands of shiploads of war munitions, food and medicine, on a credit. In America, the number of millionaires grew by leaps and bounds, because of profits on the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the war closed these American international bankers want to collect their money from foreign countries. They cannot collect any gold, because the gold is all in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They cannot collect any farm commodities, because the American farmer is working in the cold of winter and in the heat of summer to produce food and clothing, not only for the people of America, but to ship a surplus to foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These American international bankers are determined to collect their profits from foreign countries, whether or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First, there are the newspapers of America —they agitate the question that Europe should be made to pay us what they owe us. Who is us that Europe should be made to pay?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Europe did not owe the American farmer anything; therefore the American farmer was not us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Europe did not owe the American merchant anything; therefore the American merchant was not us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Europe did not owe the ordinary American banker anything; therefore the ordinary American banker was not us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the us that Europe was to be made to pay was the international banks of Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Wall Street bankers are systematic—they are not fools. They saw that before they could collect from foreign countries there must be created a shortage in foodstuffs in this country, so that foodstuffs could be imported from these debtor nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immediately, a program was put on. Six million hogs were slaughtered and thrown into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Tom Linder (Georgia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">river. One-fourth of the cotton was plowed up and destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we see millions of hogs slaughtered and thrown into the river; when we see cotton plowed up by the millions of acres; when we see farmers hired to go into the business of not raising food crops for the hungry millions, can any sane man doubt that there is deliberate method and intent to bring about a shortage of food in the United States, so that these international bankers can ship food crops from debtor nations into this country and thereby collect the war debts made twenty years ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today, I received authentic information from Washington that should startle every American, except the bankers of Wall Street, from the president down!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I will give you a few figures to indicate the extent to which this country is being thrown into chaos, in order to enable these Wall Street bankers to collect their gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the month of February, alone, which is one-twelfth of the year, this country imported from foreign countries 320,000,000 pounds of vegetable oils and oil-producing seeds and tallow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In five months we are importing as much oil as we get from our entire crop of cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America alone can use two and one-half times as much oil as we get from our entire cottonseed crop. Yet we are hiring people not to plant cotton, the most valuable food crop that we have in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the month of February we imported, among other things, 13,000,000 pounds of cottonseed oil; 4,000,000 pounds of peanut oil; 27,000,000 pounds of cocoanut oil from the Philippines; 22,000,000 pounds of palm oil from the Philippines; 111,000,000 pounds of flaxseed from which the oil is to be taken; and 16,000,000 pounds of tallow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have developed the rayon industry. Out of trees we are making cloth to substitute for cotton. We are shipping jute, duty-free, from India, and Mr. Wallace has even taken the processing tax off the jute, so that it can be made and sold cheaper than low-grade cotton, in order to encourage the importation of jute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our cotton is stacked up under a government loan but it cannot move in world markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days ago, in Liverpool, the ruling was changed, so that cotton from any country could be delivered on cotton futures contracts. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">is why the cotton market dropped two hundred points in one day, with the government guaranteeing a price of twelve cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world knows that America cannot consume the cotton which she produces and that sooner or later this cotton is going on the world markets at world-market prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the government hires the farmers to let their land lie idle and not to grow corn, we are importing a million bushels of corn every week from South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the present set-up, it will be a matter of only a short time before we will be importing wheat and hogs in like quantities as we are now importing corn and oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Corn, wine and oil were the principal commodities depended upon for sustaining human life in the early history of civilized world. Today, corn and oil are the principal products that are being imported, so that New York bankers can collect their money, while the American farmers stand idly by, asking their government for help and wondering what can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When this country, as a whole, has the most corn, the most wheat, the most livestock, the most clothing and the most shoes, that is when we, as a nation, are in the best condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we allow ourselves to, be fooled into thinking that we are better off when we have fewer of the necessities of life, because they will bring more money; when we allow ourselves to be led into a love of money, we are being led into the beginning of evil, because the love of money is the root of all evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Helps Boost the Price of Meat</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TJ OW the great desire to get the prices of food as high as possible can be helped forward is shown by two items from Toledo. The first is that 499,000 pounds of meat intended for the unemployed was kept until it was spoiled and was then shipped to Columbus and destroyed; and the second was like unto it: a federal inspector was on the way to examine 452,000 additional pounds believed to have also spoiled. Not wishing to embarrass anybody, but just can’t help wondering why this meat was not parceled out before it was spoiled. Maybe those that helped forward the spoilage are vegetarians on the rampage, but it hardly seems likely. Why was it necessary to send the trainload of spoiled meat to the political headquarters of the state to destroy it?</span></p>

Well, when nine days are up we have to wait two or three weeks again for work, then wait two weeks for our pay. I haven’t a cent. No store will let relief folks, the poorest, have things on credit. I have $5 a month rent to pay, wood to buy, flour, fattiest kind of fat back meat. I can’t buy a thing to nourish us or give us strength. I am nearly wild with worry. I stay so weak I can hardly work. No lunch to take to work. I am nearly threadbare. They will not give us clothes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">ITH the resumption of their usual habits it is found that Americans are drinking more of their own wines and paying less attention to French wines than was once the case.

<p><span class="font7">POSTAL inspector in Los Angeles, checking over bank deposits, found a $20 bill, which was part of a $129,000 mail holdup at Fall Biver, Mass. In a few hours a Boston inspector was in a plane headed east, and with him in the plane was the young man that deposited the $20 bill. The net result was 20 gangsters bagged at their headquarters in Rhode Island, all living together happily in a big 25-room summer home. The gang still had $20,000 in cash and a small arsenal. Some of them were college graduates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Government is cheated out of millions in the awarding of naval contracts. Fake bids are submitted. The bidders know weeks in advance what each bidder will bid. Their all-night fights as to who shall have the most graft have resulted in physical violence among themselves. When “The Fixer’’, who it was claimed had a White House pull, was ordered to the witness stand his physician stepped forward and said he had ‘high blood pressure’ and that it would endanger his life if he were to appear. It is claimed for this man that his connections with the Democratic National Committee enable him to place $15,000,000 of ship contracts wherever he sees tit. No wonder his blood pressure is high. It seems that some legal firms in Washington are the world’s prize grafters. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font7"> gives the names and columns of details.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany Completely Under the Domination of Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font4">ERMANY is completely under the domination of Satan. The present-day fulfilment of prophecy should fully convince all who have a knowledge of the Bible that the battle of the great day of G-od Almighty is near, and hence the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus uttered this prophecy which is now being fulfilled, to wit: “And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs; for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.”—Revelation 16:13,14,16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Germany is entirely in the camp of Satan and is openly defying God and His kingdom, as will be observed from newspaper reports and court decisions now being rendered, some of which are herein set out. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Northland Magazine</span><span class="font4"> of Germany, a Hitler publication, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who belong to the past should not worry about the way of German youth. The epoch of Christianity is absolutely done. A new myth arises born out of the battle of words of the twentieth century, a myth of blood which will decide over the fate of this people for centuries. The idea of gathering all peoples under the world-God Jehovah dies with the last generation of an inglorious age.... May the representatives of the old spirit finally acknowledge that the church with all her dogmas of the middle ages has lived its span and cannot offer anything further to the youth. The German youth of the 20th century acknowledges proudly that it can live without sin and therefore without grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same paper, in another issue, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the sign of the cross the Orient conquered the North. In the sign of the swastica the north will for ever bring to its knees all Asiadom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian World,</span><span class="font4"> No. 19, page 908, states that President Kube said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We will see to it that Germany’s youth will be brought up in the proud spirit of Langemark and not in any confessional spirit. The faith of the German youth is in Germany only.... Therefore you should remember one thing in to-day’s confessional controversy : God wishes, my German boy, that on earth you should believe in Germany and in its immortal life and we will enforce the right to such a faith for you. Adolph Hitler yesterday and to-day and for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The courts are completely under the domination of Satan. The unreasonable and devilish spirit that controls them is evidenced by the decisions recently rendered. For instance, one court sentenced a young man to prison because he showed his lady friend some scriptures in the Bible concerning God’s kingdom. The judicial opinion filed by the said court of Storbeck in the case of Germany vs. Honemann </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4"> is here set out, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Special Court of the province Saxony and the country of Anhalt has, in its session held on November 20, 1934, at Halle S., and in which took part</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Fenner, director of the Provincial Court, as president;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Haberkorn, councilor of the Provincial Court, Storbeck, councilor of the Provincial Court, as assistant judges;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rabbow, councilor of the Public Prosecution, as official of the Public Prosecutor;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Heinrich, clerk of the legal authorities as documentary official of the Office, adjudged as legal and right:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defendants are each sentenced to three months’ imprisonment on account and by reason of transgressions against §§ 1 and 4 of the Administrative Decree of the Reichspresident for the Protection of People and State, dated February 28, 1933, in connection with the decree of the Prussian Minister of the Interior, dated June 24, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defendants have to bear the costs of the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reasons:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By reason of the confession of the defendants and the testimony of the witness Criminal Assistant Nestler, it is established that the defendants have participated regularly in religious gatherings, whereby parts of the Bible have been read and discussed, etc., in a similar way as was customary before the prohibition, after the issue of the prohibition of the “International Bible Students Association” (I.B.S.A., including all its organizations) dated June 24, 1933, of the Prussian Minister of the Interior. As the defendants themselves state it, these gatherings differ from those which were held before the prohibition was issued, in general only in so far as they took place in smaller circles. The defendants no longer call themselves Bible Students. They state: The I.B.S.A. is now dissolved. There are now only Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(vide</span><span class="font4"> Harz), they mostly call themselves “witnesses of Jehovah” (as, for instance, Heinemann, Mr. and Mrs. Harz) or “Jonadabs”, that is, “people who stand on the side of God” (as Conrad) or “consecrated Christians” and “followers of Jesus” (as Mathei). They acknowledge on principle only the authority of Jehovah, the laws, etc., of worldly authorities, instance courts, etc., only in so far as these do not, according to their, the defendants’, opinions and ideas, come into conflict with the laws and decrees of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That latter has, as they state, come into contact with them personally, so that they themselves do not need any more teachings or enlightenment </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(vide</span><span class="font4"> Gehne).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is, however, their duty to visit one another and to gather together as this procedure is prescribed by the commandments of Jehovah (letter to the Hebrews) (vide Mrs. Harz). They will not allow themselves to be hindered in this by any worldly power whatsoever. They have therefore also come together to set up a petition to Reichschancellor Adolf Hitler such as is to be found in the files, and which, in substance, says that they would come together in spite of the prohibition....</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the declarations of the defendants, the literature of the kind which was in the possession of various and single defendants, and which was confiscated, was intended for those that were still to be converted. Various defendants receive such literature from Berne, as, for instance, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, Escape to the Kingdom, Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font4"> etc. Reference is made to this literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defendants have partly also sent money abroad for such literature. When they received deliveries of this kind from abroad, they regarded them as a present from Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the defendants admit the substantial circumstances, they, after all, believe that they have not rendered themselves liable to punishment. They eall attention to the fact that, as members of a religious body, they have been active only in a religious sense. They refer to the Weimar Constitution (Art. 137), as well as to the principles of the National Socialism regarding freedom of religion, and consider the prohibition of I.B.S.A. as contravening the said principles and the Reichs Constitution, and invalid, and point out explicitly that the Constitution could only be altered by a Reichs law which altered the Constitution, but not by a decree of the Reichspresident, such as that of February 28, 1933. They, first of all, lay claim to the fact that the Ministerial Decree dated June 24, 1933, whereby the I.B.S.A., inclusive of all its organizations (Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Magdeburg, etc.), is dissolved and prohibited in the territory of the Free State of Prussia, was rescinded by the letter of the Reichsminister to the American Consul General, dated September 13, 1934. This, however, is not the case. By the decree of June 24, 1933, the property and monies were also confiscated and sequestrated. In the letter of September 13,1934, it was mentioned principally that the governments of the countries have received orders to release the property and monies and not to furthermore hinder the printing and distribution of Bibles and other unsuspicious literature. The letter of September 13,1934, furthermore, however, contains the explicit passage: “On the other hand, every other activity of the Earnest Bible Students, such as teaching and meeting work, as well as the printing and distribution of tracts, leaflets, propaganda bills, etc., must remain stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of this, therefore, teaching and holding meetings and the distribution of suspicious literature is forbidden, just as heretofore, and is punishable in accordance with the decree of June 24, 1933, by reason of §4 of the Administrative Decree of February 28, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More especially is therewith also every kind of meeting activity of the I.B.S.A., etc., of hitherto, prohibited. The defendants cannot take it that in view of the fact that their meetings no longer have such large audiences as hitherto, and are therefore of a smaller kind, such gatherings are of a different character and therefore do not come under the heading of gatherings which are prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The counsel for defense has, amongst other things, put forward the Verdict of the Special Court of Darmstadt, dated March 26, 1934, S. G. M. 26/24. In this verdict the corresponding Decree of Hessen has been considered illegal, because it contravened Article 137, paragraph 2, of the Reichs Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Special Court has, however, no scruples about the validity of the Prussian regulations mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is correct that Article 137 of the Reichs Constitution “guarantees the freedom of unity of religious societies” and that this is still in force. But this can apply only and solely to such societies as do not wish to be and, above all, are really nothing else than religious societies. Only in this sense may and must Articles 136 and 137 of the Reichs Constitution be construed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The National Socialistic State assures only religious confessions their freedom, under the proviso, as a matter of course valid for every state, that the practice of “religion” does not show up in such a way as to endanger the stability of the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religious societies are therefore protected, in accordance with the Reichs Constitution, in so far only as they do not endanger the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The National Socialistic basic comprehension re this is to be seen in No. 24 of the program of the N S D A P. There we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;We demand the freedom of all religious confessions in the State, in so far as they do not endanger the stability of same or infringe the feelings of morality and good breeding of the Germanic race. The party as such take up the standpoint of a positive Christianity, without binding itself confessionally to any certain creed. It combats the Jewish-materialistie spirit in and around us and is convinced that a permanent convalescence of our nation can only result from within on the basis of mutual interest before self-interest.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cultural political principles of the N S D A P comprises, just as it does the aphorisms “Full freedom of religion and opinion” and “Special protection of Christian Confessional creeds”, also the demand: “Suppression and keeping out of all confessional doctrines which go against the German feelings of morality, the contents of which doctrines show a character destructive of state and people. ’ ’ As with every other law, so can also the Reichs Constitution be interpreted in various ways. When interpreting any law whatsoever, the real sense of the law must be ascertained and fixed. The Court must not stick to single letters or words. It would therefore be quite unreasonable to protect any kind of state-endangering contrivance simply because it appears clothed in the cloak of a religious society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every state abandons itself that (and this the more especially if by the terms of its Constitution) supports and protects an organization that fights against it to the utmost. It cannot possibly be desirous of protecting state-endangering endeavors solely for sake of their exterior form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Were the I.B.S.A., as represented by their advocates living in Germany, only a religious community, and were their members in Germany to concern themselves only with religion, then this work and activity could never be prohibited. More especially the National Socialistic State would not have the slightest interest whatever in going up against these endeavors. The representatives of the I.B.S.A. and their supporters or a similar lot, such as the defendants, are not satisfied, however, with dealing only with religious questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the defendants clearly pointed out to the Special Court, they considered it their duty to convince as large a circle of the people as possible of the correctness of their doctrines, by distributing the literature in question and by propagating their ideas and thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these pamphlets, booklets, etc., however, the Third Reich is baited in a very nasty way. The literature which was distributed by the defendants and which was partly confiscated whilst in their possession is full of destructive and decomposing material, of attacks against the government of the Reich and of thoughts which, without the slightest doubt, are of a nature destructive to state and people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that all these state-endangering and state-hostile ideas are brought out under cover of a trumpeting of religious creed is especially dangerous. Thereby all such as do not know conditions in detail are led astray. But in this case, it is not a matter of belief, pure and simple. It is rather the ease that, under the cloak of religion, a systematic, especially bitter struggle is carried on against the state of today, under the leadership of a foreign management abroad, against which the German State has no influence whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few examples taken from the literature above mentioned will explain this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The (Swiss) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> Berne, No. 281 (June 1934, page 15), deals with the only too justified demands of the government to allow the prohibition of meetings to remain in force. These demands are termed as curious and ridiculous. It is pointed out that a well-known high official of the American government has said with regard to the Nazi leaders, that: “Such as the gods will destroy, they first make mad.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The vain boasting of the German officials is censured. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Obviously with reference to the Reichs Chancelor and Leader, after mention having been made of the letters and telegrams addressed to him, it is said that “the enemy Satan tries to destroy such as have the testimony of Jesus Christ. The servant is not above his master”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Thus we see that the Devil nowadays parodically imitates the kingdom of God and that he tries to divert the attention of the people from the true Kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The above facts clearly prove that the Third Reich does not dare to style itself a component part of the Kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “unjust measures of the German authorities” are described with a complete distortion of the real facts to the extent that “our brothers” (sometimes mention is also made of “sisters”) “have been beaten and ill-treated in the concentration camps, and this only on account of their faith in God and Christ”. (That means a misuse of religious feelings and sentiments, to work up the people against the State.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the “brothers” it is said that they have stood firm in their belief and have given eloquent witness before the cruel agents of Satan, the Devil, who has been “a murderer from the beginning”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On page 13 “the persecutions of the Christians” are described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On page 11 these alleged persecutions are compared with the persecutions of the Christians in the Middle Ages. Detailed outrageous news is given as coming from concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a proclamation “to the members and officials of my former congregation” a leader gives vent to the following, on sheet 11, which sums up in “The Kingdom of God is now about to be set up”. “But that, before it is completely set up, Satan’s cruel, oppressive organization, which nowadays completely domineers over all the governments of the earth, and especially over those of ‘Christendom’, must be done away with for ever, in the battle of Armageddon. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In No. 285 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> we find, on page 12, the following poem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* ‘ The training of heroes ’ ’— A whole people must crouch And bow down under drill; The press must hush up And keep as quiet as a mouse; Bight must not show itself; Truth is hated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And thus ‘‘heroes are trained</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That serve their purposes”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time a picture shows a man swinging a whip over a company of men drilling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The adherents of the I.B.S.A. are therefore, as is shown by these specimens, without the slightest doubt, hostile and opposed to the State, and most especially to the National Socialistic State, and also operate and strengthen this hostility thereby, inasmuch as they come together in small circles as in former times and stick together, having printed matter of the kind shown above, sent from abroad, and which latter they distribute in this country. As the Special Court in Darmstadt has quite correctly stated, in the abovementioned verdict on this point, they reject the State altogether as a “work of the Devil”. They are subject to foreign influences which cannot be gone into and examined and show Jewish tendencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a vital necessity for the new state to protect itself most decidedly against such state-endangering contrivances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Special Court has convinced itself, by the impression it got in the Chief Session, of the personalities of the defendants and their manner of appearance before the Court, how very right the Prussian Minister of the Interior was, when he states, in the decree of June 24, 1933, that “their methods of contest are characterized by a fanatical influencing of their adherents”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As is furthermore stated, an astonishingly large number of adherents of former communistic and marxistic parties and organizations have been received into the ranks of the Bible Students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There can consequently be absolutely no question of the prohibition of the I.B.S.A., etc., as having infringed upon the Constitution of the Reich. For Articles 135 and the following ones, in view of their aforementioned, alone possible sense and purpose (and that is what really comes into consideration, not the single letter), cover and protect only purely and exclusively religious societies, but not associations like the I.B.S.A. or the “witnesses of Jehovah”, which are assuredly also religious societies, but apart from that are furthermore eminently state-endangering unions. The Prussian prohibition, rather than being a violation of the Constitution, was an urgent necessity, because elements hostile to the State had joined up under the cloak of a religious society to develop activities hostile to the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defendants have therefore to be punished in accordance with §4 of the Administrative Decree of February 28, 1933, by reason of contravention of the decree of the Minister, dated June 24, 1933, for renewed activity in the sense of the I.B.S.A. The law provides for imprisonment for from not under one month up to five years or for a fine up to Marks 15,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Court has taken into consideration the fact that, with the exception of one of the defendants, all of the latter have hitherto been without punishment. On the other hand, however, the danger which indeed is to be perceived for the German community had to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A penalty of three months’ imprisonment seemed therefore to be the necessary but also quite sufficient atonement for the deed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The decision regarding the charges is based upon §§ 464, 465, Criminal Law Regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Signed) Dr. Fenner Dr. Haberkorn Storbeck</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both by word and by act the government and the courts of Germany show that they do not care what the commandments of Jehovah God may be. They boldly condemn honest men and women for the perfectly reasonable and proper stand that human laws can be properly obeyed and enforced only if they are in accord with the divine law. The issue is clearly drawn. Other servants of God than those already mentioned are similarly unjustly condemned and punished. The Westfalische Landeszeitung </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rote Erde</span><span class="font4"> of November 13, 1934, calling Jehovah’s witnesses “fanatical sectarians, the religious garb for international movements”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mrs. Lydia Herrmann, 22 years of age, whose husband is also accused and in a concentration camp as a former communist, and Mrs. Luise Schwedler, 42 years old, both from Castrop-Rauxel, had to appear before the Dortmund Court and account for the distribution of forbidden literature of the International and therefore dissolved Association of the “Earnest Bible Students”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mrs. Lydia H. appeared rather challenging and assured the Court that in calling upon Jehovah she would in the future also do her duty in this, that she would call the attention of her fellow-men to the Kingdom of God and the near establishment of the Kingdom of Christ Jesus on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For this great offense the court of justice (?) sentenced Mrs. Herrmann to one year in prison, and her fellow witness to nine months. The sentence was made severe because the accused “showed no repentance”. Such is religious liberty in Germany today. But Satan is not limiting his activities to that land. In America, England, Canada, and other countries where a measure of freedom of speech still obtains, desperate efforts are made to control the freedom of speech and the publication of the truth. Unreasonable laws, cunningly framed, are advanced to suppress the liberties of the people and to make them amenable to the arbitrary and shortsighted policies of fallible men in contravention of the Word of God. We may expect to see these priceless liberties, bought at such great cost, shortly taken away from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what is back of all this retrogression, this turning back to Dark Age methods and practices? What power, unseen but clearly in evidence, is limiting and circumscribing the rights, privileges and liberties of the people? What is back of it all? The Scriptures answer, It is the power of the demons. These, under the leadership of the rapacious Gog, are seeking to bring together, and do bring together, the ruling powers of the earth in a determined stand against righteousness and truth, and, above all, against Jehovah, the eternal God. Only recently </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The News of the World,</span><span class="font4"> London, carried an article in which Lord Riddell told how Lloyd George and Winston Churchill believe themselves to be under the guidance of unseen powers or spirits. The article reads, in part, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We (Lord Riddell and Mr. Lloyd George) walked along the shore (at Criccieth), and sat for some time on the rocks watching the waves. L. G. gave me an insight into a curious side of his character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He showed me a letter he had received from a palmist and soothsayer, who stated, among other things, that L. G. was beset by many dangers, but would be protected by unseen spirits until he had accomplished a great mission he was destined to perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">L. G. said: “That is a remarkable statement, because I am myself convinced that nothing will be allowed to happen to me until I have accomplished some great work for which I have been singled out. I feel that I shall be quite secure until then.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I said: “But what is to happen afterwards?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Ah,” he replied, “afterwards! Well, afterwards, I suppose I shall share the fate of all other men who have been selected to perform great works. I shall be left to my fate. I shall be deserted. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In January, 1914, when he was fighting a ding-dong battle in the cabinet for a stronger navy, Mr. Winston Churchill also confided to Lord Riddell that he was “watched over”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Think,” he said, “of the perils I have escaped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hitler, too, is considered as under the direction of some “spirit”. In a German illustrated magazine there appeared a reproduction of a picture which hangs in the Brandenburg Hall of the City Hall of Berlin-Schoneberg. The title of the picture is “The divine mission of NationalSocialism”. It represents Hitler standing upon a mountain, and in the sky appears an angel offering him a globe upon which appears the swastika. Other prominent men and leaders in the financial and political field, as well as in ecclesiastical circles, are known to have communication of one kind or another with invisible powers. Spirit mediums frequently figure in</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">scope readings, occult revelations and what not. All these things, according to the Holy Scriptures, are definitely of the Devil and his invisible cohorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection attention is called to the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Angels,</span><span class="font4"> published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brooklyn, N.Y., which booklet clearly sets forth the position and the activities of these demons, or fallen angels. A clear understanding of this matter is now possible, and is of the greatest importance to those who would be found on the side of Jehovah God in the great conflict that is fast approaching. battle. Satan’s forces, under the leadership of Gog, will fight against the hosts of Jehovah, under the direction of Christ Jesus. On which side will you be? Knowledge is of the greatest consequence. Satan will deceive all who do not love truth and righteousness and who refuse to obey Jehovah God, but the Lord has made provision for the enlightenment of the meek and honest-hearted, the people of good will. These, like Jonadab of old, will be in heart harmony with Jehovah’s King, the Greater Jehu, and will ‘ride with Him, in His chariot’, as He vanquishes the hosts of wickedness for all time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>In Defense</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HAT a few clergymen are not entirely blind to common justice and fairness is evident from the fact that at the trial of two of Jehovah’s witnesses in Quebec recently, Louis Abram, a United church pastor, appeared as a defense witness. He stated that while he did not agree with all the teachings in the books distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses he was not of the opinion that they were of a nature to incite the people to revolt. It was another clergyman, L. M. Pepperdene of the Anglican church, who made such a charge, saying that the writings in question were “subversive to law and order and held in contempt all constituted authority”. He said he testified with the sanction of the bishop of Quebec as a representative of the Anglican church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness and Canadian Homestead</span><span class="font4"> of Montreal, in its issue of November 28,1934, discussing the trial, said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Freedom of speech and religion in the province of Quebec received another body blow last week by the imposition of fines or imprisonment upon members of the sect calling themselves “Jehovah’s witnesses” on charges of sedition. The “sedition” consisted of severe animadversions upon modern governments and the churches, Roman Catholic and Protestant, contained in booklets which the accused people were selling in the city of Quebec. ... Critical as they are of most human institutions, they have not been shown at any time to have urged violent overturning of these—preferring as they do to predict that God himself will destroy that which is unworthy. What they said about the various Protestant churches is pretty much what ardent Roman Catholic apologists have themselves said on repeated occasions. It is diffi-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>of Fairness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">cult to resist the suspicion that it was their inclusion of the Roman Catholic church in their condemnation and their references to the pope that prompted the prosecutions. Freedom of speech as a principle must be upheld even for the protection of a truculent minority. Because of their unpopular opinions, this particular minority’s plight has been ignored by many who would have leaped to the defense of any orthodox religious body whose elementary rights were menaced. But it is not freedom at all, if it is denied to the weak and unpopular. It is indeed painful to see a Church of England clergyman with, as he claimed, the approval of the Anglican bishop of Quebec, joining in the attack by taking the witness box to testify that what the pamphlets contained could fairly be described as sedition. It ought surely to be evident both to the rector and to his ecclesiastical superior that the proceedings at Quebec are merely another phase of the same brand of intolerance which in Montreal is bringing before the courts an Anglican brother clergyman on a charge of blasphemy for saying in public and in print what all three believe of a distinctive Roman Catholic doctrine, and which also in Montreal is dissolving legally celebrated marriages upon the strength of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical decrees against which Bishop Lennox-Williams of Quebec has himself made emphatic protest. Open freedom of speech is far safer than subterranean whisperings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This impartial comment brought forth the following observation from Allan H. Ferry, a clergyman of Corbetton, Ont., which appeared in the December 12 issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness and Canadian Homestead:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir:—May I compliment you on your editorial in the issue of November 28 under the caption “This Freedom”? I cannot help wondering whether we are embarking on an era of religious persecution in </span><span class="font4">Canada, when I read of such cases as the one referred to by you, and others that are known to some of us but which have not reached the publicity stage. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the same issue appeared a long letter from the “Rev.” L. M. Pepperdene, who evidently got hot under the clerical collar when he read something that seemed to favor even a measure of fairness and impartiality. In this letter Pepperdene included several alleged quotations from hooks distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses. These excerpts were so arranged as to give the impression that Jehovah’s witnesses denied the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, a glaring misrepresentation. If Pepperdene had lied outright his object could not have been more patent. He sought to shock the religious susceptibilities of the readers of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness and Canadian Homestead</span><span class="font4"> so that they would ever thereafter be thoroughly prejudiced against them. Pepperdene, both in his testimony and in his letter, was a “false witness”; for his unfairness is evident even to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness and Canadian Homestead,</span><span class="font4"> as will be seen from their comment on Pepperdene’s letter. Judge Rutherford has charged that Catholic and Protestant clergymen are in a conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses and their work. Pepperdene’s letter shows that this charge is in no sense an exaggeration. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> quotes at length from Pepperdene’s letter and from comment thereon appearing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness and Canadian Homestead</span><span class="font4"> as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(To the Editor of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir:—I have read and reread your editorial of November 28, regarding the recent conviction of the self-styled “Jehovah’s witnesses” in the Quebec court during the previous week, with much interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I feel that you are not conversant with all the facts of the case. In the first place you write as though his lordship the bishop and myself were the only Protestant' clergy who had taken action in this matter. I should like to advise you, out of fairness to my bishop, that the action which I took was the outcome of a conference of the Protestant clergy in Quebec at which every Protestant church was represented with but one exception. At that conference, besides myself, representing the Anglican church, there was the Rev. Dr. Gordon of the Presbyterian church and the Rev. Mr. Matheson of the United church. We discussed the matter very fully, not even forgetting the case of Mr. Rahard of Montreal, and finally came to the conclusion that there was no comparison between the two cases, the one in which we as Christian ministers were interested here in Quebec, and the one in Montreal in which we are all also interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For reasons which are of little interest to anyone other than ourselves, I was asked if I would take the stand as representing the group. This I did only after further very serious consideration and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Personally I cannot feel that the question of freedom of speech is so vitally involved in this case. The trouble with so many people is, that they will confuse freedom of speech with license. These people have not been denied freedom of speech; they have never to my knowledge tried to hold a meeting and address the public in decent language. They came to Quebec under cover of early morning darkness and proceeded to scatter abroad literature which attacked everything which a Christian ought to hold most sacred. Literature which I would not have fall into the hands of my own children were they old enough to read it, under any consideration. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let me assure you, my dear sir, that the group of clergymen whom I represented in the witness box at that trial would be just as zealous, if not more so, to defend any orthodox Christian, or anyone else, for that matter, whose fundamental rights were menaced. But to spread among a peaceful community literature which is seditious, libelous and slanderous, is not a fundamental right of any citizen, and more especially when it is imported from a foreign country. It is not British. It is not Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your article of November held a very prominent place in your paper. I hope that you will publish this letter in an equally prominent place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">L. M. Pepperdene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note:—Mr. Pepperdene makes the very common error of confusing defense of a principle with support of the beliefs of those for whom application of that principle is advocated. St. Paul’s warfare for the faith was purely spiritual and polemic, We have yet to learn that he sought the aid of the civil power, or called for the exercise of force against those who taught “another gospel”. Liberty is not liberty at all unless it is extended to all alike. It becomes a mockery when refused to an unpopular minority. It includes the right of talking nonsense, such as we believe the peculiar doctrines of “Jehovah’s witnesses” to be. The appearance on the witness stand of a Protestant clergyman in support of the case for the defense shows that not all Quebec Protestantism was prepared to lend itself to the aims of an intolerant majority. It will hardly be argued that this minister’s testimony—that he did not look upon the literature dispensed by the accused as ‘ 'seditious ’ ’—implies that he agrees whole-heartedly with its contents. Literature which in Mr. Pepperdene’s phrase, is “seditious, libelous and slanderous” is proscribed by the laws of every civilized country. It is strange that the literature under review has not encountered legal inhibition in any parts of Canada or the British Empire other </span><span class="font4">than in Quebec, where the courts have been called to the aid of religious intolerance. A recent dispatch from Germany tells of a jail sentence imposed on a member of the sect in Berlin. It would be interesting to know how many of the clergymen who lent their aid to this prosecution bestirred themselves when, in 1933, a young “orthodox Christian” was brought to trial in the same city for blasphemy for selling or distributing a pamphlet written by a Baptist minister of Ottawa. True, the Christian church ought to expose heresies—even such as are hugged by the dominant majority in this province. And is there no distortion or suppression of truth among Protestants? Experience since the days of the early church has shown that the least effective method of extirpating error is by persecuting it. A martyr now and again strengthens the cause for which he suffers. Do Mr. Pepperdene and his fellow-pastors really think that the propagation of the errors of “Jehovah’s witnesses” will be in any way checked by this invoking of the arm of flesh, even should the appeal of the convicted persons be rejected by a higher court of law? Nothing the erroneous sect can do will impair the Christian church so much as the negation of Christ by its members in everyday individual and national life. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witness</span><span class="font4"> has long and earnestly looked for the closer coming together of all who profess and call themselves Christians, but the kind of co-operation of denominations which Mr. Pepperdene cites in his letter is one that it is to be hoped will not be repeated. Better isolation than to unite in what, were the shoe on the other foot, would rightly be regarded as a conspiracy against the operation of a sacred principle. Understanding the meaning of that word we cannot silently see it so violated that free speech is limited to those with whom we are in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We Don't Want Intervention</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE Catholic hierarchy is trying its best to get the United States mixed up in Mexico’s internal affairs, meanwhile declaring loudly that the Catholic church ‘don’t want intervention in Mexico, nohow’. One of the Hierarchy’s representatives, J. S. Holgan, is all “het up” because Mexico is going to have just plain Mexican schools and will not let the church interfere. Mexico has the right idea and wants to give the children a real opportunity to start life with a fairly sane outlook. General Calles had said, “We must enter into and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.” The United States ambassador thought that was a good idea, and happened to express his thought too publicly. Now the Catholic hierarchy is trying to have him recalled. Soon, no doubt, we shall have Catholic societies sending resolutions to Congress or to the president, just as they sent resolutions to newspapers and radio stations in the case of Judge Rutherford in their effort to get him off the air. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, particularly to the Hierarchy. And to have others adopt their scheme of getting possession of the mind of childhood is just too much for those who thrive on ignorance and superstition. We do not see, however, how anyone could do more harm than the Hierarchy has done in getting possession of the minds of the children. The Hierarchy would dearly love to see the United States do something about the Mexican situation, while they cry “Intolerance!” and other similar expressions of dismay. But it is very much like the boy who cried “Wolf!” too often. No attention is being paid to the Hierarchy’s loud and bitter howls. People just don’t believe what the Hierarchy tries to tell them. Confidence is not instilled by mere assertions. There must be something back of them. The Catholic church has not delivered the goods. The countries where she has exercised greatest power are the countries where she is least trusted. The United States government will do well to keep its eyes open.</span></p>

Perhaps it was just to be on speaking terms with the little fellow that the postmaster general was so condescending as to stoop so low. It certainly cannot be, and yet it might, that the postmaster general was doing obeisance to the little man, and that it is all a part of the game. If that be so, and if Al Smith had been made president of the United States, Americans might have had the edifying (or mortifying) example of their president kneeling to a little representative of a little state in Italy. (There is no record that Cicognani said, “Stand up; I myself also am a man.”—See Acts 10:26.) And now they say Farley is going to resign as postmaster general.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Ratti, of the Vatican, familiarly known to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> readers as Ambrose, likes to have the American bishops call on him. Every time an American bishop calls, papa gets a nice present, some bishops bringing as much as $60,000, and that amount is not to be sneezed at these days, not even by papa Ambrose. Last year the proceeds from these visits netted him over a million dollars. One of our subscribers, commenting on this fact, says, “Please note — $1,000,000 to Ambrose. Why not use this swag in the U. S. A. —in Ohio, for instance, where the Catholics are asking taxpayers to use State money to keep their propaganda schools going?” This answer to the question is fairly obvious.</span></p>

C. Barrett, Belleville, Ont., convicted on charges of being parties to a seditious conspiracy. Their lawyers have announced an appeal will be taken against the conviction.” The item does not state that the “sedition” consisted of a distribution of Bible literature. Since the incident occurred in Quebec, which is strongly Roman Catholic, it is clear why the distribution of Bible literature is considered “seditious”. It is well to remember that Jesus was crucified for “sedition”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Prisoner in the Breadbox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">ID you know that there are people who worship a god who is kept prisoner in a breadbox, a very fancy and ornate breadbox, to be sure, but a prisoner nevertheless? And did you know that this god, should you see him taken out of his breadbox prison, would present himself to you as a wafer, a piece of bread, or several wafers? Such is nevertheless the case, and all the ceremony of the “temples made with hands” in which this god, duplicated a thousand times, dwells, centers around the idea that he is really there, in the breadbox, a prisoner. Before the breadbox burns a candle or taper continually. And, does it not surprise you to learn that the people who worship this “god” call themselves Christians at times, though they are more generally known as “Roman Catholics”? That the prisoner in the box is really the big power back of the priestly control of the people is not generally known. For only the priest can “create” this “god”, and the only way the worshipers can ever get out of purgatory or escape eternal torment is to eat him, while they are alive, or to have somebody else eat him for them after they die. All this comes from a literal and material interpretation of Jesus’ symbolical words, “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eucharistic Quarterly</span><span class="font4"> tells about this prisoner in the breadbox: “He who is greater than all is left alone, with none to keep him company to while away the weary hours of the day and the dreary watches of the night—none but the tiny taper with its flickering light like a guard before the tabernacle door behind which is detained the prisoner of love ... in chains in our tabernacles.”</span></p>

In that same benighted province the priests of the Catholic hierarchy rule with a high hand. The following letter is a fair sample of the treatment they accord their parishioners when they do not come across with the cash demanded for the “support” of the rector. If there is a note of clemency and kindness in the letter, we have failed to detect it. The rector does not make allowance for parents who are having all they can do to make both ends meet. Jesus’ description of the scribes and Pharisees of His day exactly fits the clergy of the present. The exceptions are so few that'they cannot be taken into consideration. The letter, translated from the French, follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Parishioner:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(a) Beginning January 1, 1935, those who will not have made a settlement for their support already due, namely, for the years 1934, 1933, etc., etc., ... will see themselves refused by me all exterior religious service, as call for the sick and others....</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">O COMMEMORATE the Lord’s poverty when on earth, the Roman Catholic hierarchy keeps a large part of its membership poor. To commemorate the riches which the Lord left to redeem mankind, the priests and other members of the Hierarchy live in the greatest splendor. This was forcibly brought to the attention of the public when three golden chalices were stolen from the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Victory, at Throop avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y. Each of the chalices was studded with diamonds, and the three were valued at $5,000. It is a very convenient arrangement to have the poor remember the poverty of the Lord, as the pope admonished the unemployed to do, while he and his assistants the world over forget that the Lord left His riches to become poor for the sake of fallen mankind, and especially to honor and vindicate His Father’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Coughlin and the Monroe Doctrine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">( * Ip<sup>ATHER</sup>” Coughlin seems to be slightly confused, as he is trying to stir up the people of the United States against Mexico and to claim that the Monroe Doctrine makes it incumbent upon the United States to interfere. He is all mixed up. What the Monroe Doctrine says is that no European power shall interfere in the affairs of any independent government in the Western Hemisphere; and that would seem to indicate that the shoe is on the other foot; and that the United States, if it did anything, would call upon Vatican City to desist from interfering in the case of Mexico’s internal problems. The Monroe Doctrine reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power, we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But, with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power, in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the Vatican is a temporal European power, its interference in Mexican affairs through its tools in any part of the world is apparently in conflict with the terms of the Monroe Doctrine.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Charles Coughlin vs. Wm. O’Connell</span></h3>

<p><span class="font4">O’Connell, celebrating his birthday in Boston, observed that Coughlin and “all clergymen, no matter what creed, tread hazardous ground” when trying directly to solve political or economic problems. To this “Father” Coughlin replied: “If he spoke as a churchman as he did on the three occasions when he publicly rebuked me he has done nothing more than to usurp the power which belongs to the apostolic delegate in America.” He goes on to say that he himself was carrying out the instructions of Pius XI and Leo XIII. Coughlin may come to the point where he will recognize that both of these gentlemen have usurped an authority which was never given them by the only sources of authority in the church, Jehovah God and His Son Jesus Christ. Another observation by Coughlin is of interest, to wit: “For more than forty years William Cardinal O’Connell has been more notorious for his silence on social justice than for any contribution he may have given either in practice or in doctrine toward the elimination of those glaring injustices which permitted the plutocrats of this nation to wax fat at the expense of the poor. Now he castigates me for doing what he was ordered to do.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The year saw further radio stations banning the broadcasts of “Judge” Rutherford, but it also saw petitions favorable to the retention of Rutherford broadcasts on the air descend upon members of Congress in great numbers. Investigations made in three separate cities showed that a large number of persons signing these petitions had no clear understanding of the petition they signed; that many had never heard “Judge” Rutherford’s broadcasts; that the names of some appeared on the list without their knowledge; that in a number of cases one person signed for a number of persons, and that many who signed were surprised to learn later the nature of the Rutherford broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It need only be added that these “investigations” were made by Catholic agents who had no business to have the petition, in the first place, and whose words are not to be relied upon, in the second place. Members of Congress who turned over some of these petitions to the agents of the Romish priests thereby showed that they were not serving the people but the interests of a foreign meddler who is now trying to stir up trouble between Mexico and the United States to protect its own unrighteous schemes of extortion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Catholic priests get into the papers, but censors apparently had difficulty in handling the case of “Father” John J. Leonard of Lawrenceville, N.

The story reads: “The five shots which Steinmetz allegedly poured from an automatic into the bodies of his wife and the priest brought hotel employees quickly to the room. Opening the door they saw the student lying in what they described as a ‘drunken stupor’.... Beside him lay the bodies of the wife and Father Leonard— fully clothed.” The addition of the last two words was probably the best the censor could do, considering the fact that the lady and the priest were found together in his bedroom.</span></p>

No Christian can take sides in a matter of a persecution of a religion or a race.’ ” If we could only feel sure that the cardinal meant it. If he did, he should say something about the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey and elsewhere and the boycotting of radio stations that broadcast Judge Rutherford’s lectures. The Roman Catholic church is back of that. It is likely, however, that the cardinal does not mean what he appears to say. Adept in casuistry, members of the Hierarchy can say things that appear to be directly contrary to the well known and long established policy of the Roman church, and then explain to the proper persons just what they did mean.</span></p>

Seven days later the child was circumcised and given a Jewish name, and inducted into the Jewish faith with full ritual, but all without the knowledge of his father or mother. Now the parents, true Roman Catholics, are suing the hospital for $75,000. It seems possible that Mr. and Mrs. Lyman have not heard of the tolerance and harmony that now exist between Catholics, Jews and Protestants, but it will probably be called to their attention by their ‘father confessor’, upon which they ■wdll forgive the mistake of the hospital authorities and will, unquestionably, withdraw the suit.

Subsequently the cardinal said, “I have never come to Washington without presenting myself to the president. ...” This is very nice of the cardinal. It shows his humility of mind. It shows, too, that he probably does not feel as bitter toward Protestants as does Mr. Ratti of Vatican City, better known to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> readers as Ambrose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font4">DDRESSING the Union League Club, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace said: “It is interesting to reflect that in 1929, in the United States, the 36,000 families with the greatest income received as much as the 11,000,000 families with the least income. Since 1929, of course, the income of the 36,000 has doubtless been cut in half. Nevertheless, most of the 36,000 still have far more than they can possibly consume.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Against the New Deal have come thundering highly individualistic business men, mostly of the Protestant background, but some Catholic, some Jewish, and all cast in the mold of nineteenth-century economics and biology. Ruthless go-getters, they are still determined to get theirs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We wonder why the secretary stressed the fact that most of these go-getters had a Protestant background? That should be expected in a country which is less than twenty percent Catholic. In Catholic countries the go-getters are Catholic, or if they are not go-getters it is because they already have grabbed everything in sight. It is an undeniable fact that in Catholic countries the common people are far worse off than in countries mainly Protestant.</span></p>

As variations of tension change the pitch of the wires, it provides a basis for calculating how much strain the dam is subjected to. This method of measuring pressure or strain is called teletensometry. Pressures on the strata of rocks in mines and tunnels were measured by this method long before it was utilized in the Dnieprostroy dam. Measurement of stress in tunnels enables engineers to design lining and props that will offset the strain.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>What the Iceman Says</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HERE is really no such thing as an &quot;electric refrigerator”. Every ice machine uses a chemical refrigerant; electricity simply drives the pump that compresses the gases. Many people do not know that “electric refrigerators” use gas and that there is an element of danger in their use. The gases used are either poisonous, suffocating, explosive or toxic, or would be if they escaped, which sometimes happens. The leading manufacturers use sulphur dioxide, one part of which to ten thousand parts of air is intolerable to human creatures. Methyl chloride, escaping from a basement plant, resulted in killing a family composed of father, mother and baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Washington, D. C., recently passed a local ordinance requiring every ice machine to bear a label indicating the kind of gas used therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In hot weather the pressure in the small ice machine increases sometimes to over a hundred pounds to the square inch (more than twice as high as in the average tire), and the danger of explosion increases proportionately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mechanical refrigerators must be defrosted once a week or so, during which process there is no refrigeration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Service men wear gas masks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meats, fruits and vegetables are shipped in ice-refrigerated cars almost exclusively. Ice is preferred because it is dependable and does not dry out or ruin the flavor of delicate foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 64 percent of all ice is consumed between June 15 and September 15. During that time light is used proportionately less; so it is difficult to determine just how much electricity the ice machine uses. It is estimated, however, that an electric refrigerator in the home doubles the bill for electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While an ordinary icebox will last twenty to twenty-five years, an ice machine depreciates far more rapidly. It would be remarkable if a machine lasted ten years, but if it did, and cost $200 to begin with, the depreciation would be $20 yearly. Current, on an average, would be $24 yearly, and service charges about $15; which is about $59 yearly, twice the size of the average ice bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[After reading this most of our readers will be reconciled to having to hold on to the old icebox a little longer.]</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>The Abundant Metal Again</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font4">RADUALLY, during the past eight or ten years, and stimulated by the incessant labors of Dr. Betts, of Toledo, and the many warnings given in the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> the people are waking up to the fact that they are being slowly poisoned to death. The proof is incontrovertible, but it is no easy matter to convince all the people, or even to get them to investigate the subject. The fact that nearly “everybody” uses aluminum ware, and the fact that it is beautiful and convenient, and sold by the “best” stores, advertised in the “best” magazines, recommended by the “best” doctors, and used in many (not all) of the “best” hospitals, is convincing, to most people, that it is the proper thing. These “best” recommendations have also “taught” the people that any who differ with these opinions, or who attempt to “show up” these fraudulent claims, are “fanatics”, “quacks” or “radicals”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, it is cheering to note that many doctors, chemists, scientists, dietitians and professors have become convinced that foods cooked or allowed to stand in aluminum containers are thereby poisoned and unfit to eat. These are lifting up their voices in protest and are warning the people of this danger. It is also cheering to note that some of the aluminum manufacturers are quietly changing from aluminum to stainless steel ware. I have also learned of two retail concerns who refuse to handle aluminum ware and warn their customers against its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By R. H. Barber (New York)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many people are entirely unaware of the fact that common alum is simply aluminum in another form, and that in using alum baking powder they are slowly but surely filling the system with a poison “deposit” from which they must suffer in after years. Millions of tons of alum are dumped into the city and village water reservoirs every year, to further increase this poison “deposit” in the system. The city and village health officials do this on the recommendation of the above-mentioned “best” authorities, while the aluminum manufacturers use their highly paid magazine writers and other “hirelings” to put forth propaganda intended to make the people believe that aluminum ware is a gift sent from the “gods” for man’s blessing and health. The doctors and health officials drink in this propaganda, aid in setting it before the people, and deny and belittle the efforts of honest persons who try to get the truth to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Persons possessing a strong digestive apparatus and great power of resistance to poisons laugh at the charge that food cooked in aluminum is harmful. But sooner or later it “gets” them. Others with less power of resistance are poisoned and made ill by eating a single meal cooked in aluminum. I am one of the latter class, and on several occasions have been made severely ill by eating such foods, not realizing that they were cooked in aluminum, until too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why is it that, within the period during which aluminum has been brought to the fore, skin diseases, blood diseases and intestinal diseases have increased by leaps and bounds'? Cancers, and ulcers of the mouth, stomach and intestinal tract, are killing many thousands today, wdiile the doctors are unable to cure the sufferers or to explain the prevalence of these diseases. The medics frankly admit these facts. It is really encouraging to note that several important hospitals have junked their aluminum and refuse to use it further, and admit that it is injurious to use it for cooking purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few months ago I served at a funeral held in the city where “The World’s Largest Rayon Mill” is located. The deceased was a young married woman, who worked in this rayon mill. This particular mill served its employees with a dinner which was cooked on the premises, and in aluminum. This young woman took a bus for her home after the day’s work was completed, and en route was taken violently ill, with nausea and vomiting, and it became necessary to take her into a house along the road; and after suffering terribly she died, in just a short time. At the funeral I learned these facts, and also that the doctor could give no reason for her death. Readers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> will identify this as only another case of aluminum poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This brings me to my object in writing this letter. Another disease, which has come into existence recently, is called by the name “athlete’s foot”. This is a smarting sensation, usually between the toes, and is accompanied, at times, with a sort of a blister, which, when broken, exudes a watery fluid. Often the skin cracks between the toes, and the patient suffers greatly. I realize all this by a sad experience with the pesky disease. Many men and women complain of this same stinging and smarting sensation under the arms, and in other places where perspiration is prevalent. What causes this disease? The doctors do not know. For want of a better name (and to impress people with their wisdom) they call it “athlete’s foot”. Please notice, that at all the points affected the skin is very thin, tender and sensitive, and subject to almost continuous perspiration due to the constant friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what has this to do with aluminum poisoning? My answer is as follows: While serving at the above-mentioned funeral in the city where “The World’s Largest Rayon Mill” is located, I accidentally learned that the young woman was accustomed to eating her dinner at the mill, and that it was always cooked in aluminum. This brought up the subject of aluminum poisoning. A bystander, listening to the conversation, remarked that all rayon products are “weighted” with aluminum, just as silk is “weighted” with tin. These metals give them their luster and weight. The heavier silks and rayons have more of the metals in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, I am not a chemist, a scientist, a professor or a doctor, but I am nearly “nine-eighths” convinced that this poisonous metal gets in touch with the tender, sensitive and perspiring skin and that this is what causes the mischief. Of course, the highly paid chemists, so-called “scientists” and doctors will deny this. But the very best possible proof is “facts”. And here are the facts. Last week, Friday, I had occasion to serve at a second funeral in the same city where “The World’s Largest Rayon Mill” is located. At the time I was suffering terribly with a specially severe attack of so-called “athlete’s foot”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the funeral, I was visiting with a husband and wife, and the subject of aluminum poisoning came up again, occasioned by a reading of the first article on this subject in September 12 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> I mentioned the fact that rayon products are “weighted” with aluminum. Both the husband and wife denied the statement, with emphasis. The wife said that she knew the statement was not true, because she had formerly worked in the rayon mill. I felt quite sure that they v<sup>T</sup>ere mistaken, and pressed the point. Finally they began to enumerate the different things used in making rayon. After mentioning several things, the husband paused and said, “There is another thing they put in the acid, and I cannot remember what it is.” Instantly the wife spoke up and said, “Alum.” Neither one of them knew that alum is aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now for the best part of this story: I arrived home, immediately took off the pair of “pretty” rayon hose, gave my smarting feet a good bath and put on a pair of common, everyday, homely and despised cotton socks. After three days the smarting all disappeared, and I have had no “athlete’s foot” since that time. It is now three months since this occurred. Will the cure be permanent? Well, it remains to be seen. I believe it ■will. Here’s hoping that these suggestions ■will be of some help to those poor creatures who are suffering with “athlete’s foot”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am writing this in hope that someone who possesses the necessary qualifications, such as time, proper instruments and real honesty, will make an investigation, and render a proper and honest report, which will be a blessing to the people, but which will not be intended to sell more aluminum ware. Aluminum is a fine article for use in making automobile bodies, streamlined railroad trains, and airplanes, but it is entirely out of place when used as a lining for the stomach and intestines or to “weight” the kidneys, liver and other internal organs, doctors and chemists to the contrary notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Poisoning by Aspirin </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Chas. T. Betts (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">cetosalicylic</span><span class="font4"> acid is a coal-tar product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Manufacturing chemists use the word “Aspirin” for the trade name. It was first produced in Germany, after which it has been extensively made and sold in other countries for the purpose of the alleviation of pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the National Medical Convention at Detroit in 1915 it was stated that practically all disease is caused by “focal infection”: absorption of pus from abscessed teeth, pyorrhea or diseased tonsils. The medics gave this information to their patients upon returning to their various homes. As a result a teeth-extracting and tonsillectomy orgy began which has continued to the present day, yet no particular general health benefit has been noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public soon learned that the above remedy was not giving them relief. Many found, after the operation, that pain continued rampant in their bodies. After taking medical treatment and most of their money was gone they did not know which way to turn. Often they see advertising by drug manufacturers, heralding the virtues of agents that give relief for various ills. One of the most extensively advertised for this purpose is aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VERDICT BY THE UNITED STATES DISPENSATORY BY WOOD-LA WALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Aspirin has been one of the most popularly used drugs in the last two decades. It has been grossly and variously adulterated, especially during the World War. Among the adulterants reported have been sugar, starch, tale, tartaric acid, acetanilid, phenacetin, milk sugar, salol, acid calcium phosphate, bone acid and cream of tartar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There have been reported a considerable number of cases of aspirin poisoning in humans with symptoms very different from those caused by the salicylates, and in many of these cases of poisoning the dosage has been so small as to practically exclude salicylic. After two doses of five grains each there occurred marked cardiac weakness with pulse rate of 136 and edematous swelling of the face and mucous membranes with eversion of the lids and lips with the swelling. Shelby has reported alarming edema of the face from a single dose of 5 grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Overdoses of aspirin commonly produce ringing in the ears. Frequently, however, even in quantities not excessive, it produces a very different type of intoxication. Among the most common symptoms are profuse sweating, cold extremities, either with or without a fall in body temperature, rapid or irregular pulse, and occasionally albuminuria. In many reported cases there has been marked facial edema involving not only the skin but the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1913 many ailments attracted attention, but those of the stomach seemed to exceed all others. The writer found that drugs were often psed by his patients to relieve pain in various parts of the body, especially headache. It was noted that some contracted general systemic poisoning by the ingestion of aluminum which dissolved from their cooking utensils or was taken into the body by drinking faucet water or eating baked goods containing alum (aluminum) baking powders. Many were completely cured by no other therapy than discontinuing the use of aluminum cooking utensils and alum products. Those who did not do this often resorted to the use of aspirin, to allay their aches and pains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At times the effects are brought vividly before us, especially when it is “news”; then the public press will print items that should cause an individual to stop and think. A city policeman, Joe Swionteck, was charged with being drunk while on duty. When taken to the station, Safety Director A. D. Black suspended him for 21 days. Directly after, however, the official reported that there was no evidence to prove charges of drunkenness against the patrolman, the man admitted that he had been overcome by a dose of aspirin, taken shortly before he was found. The article describing the above case is contained in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Toledo Blade</span><span class="font4"> of October 22,1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the writer’s patients use aspirin regularly. They seldom understand what causes that pale or ashen color of the face. It is only after repeated questioning that they admit taking it. After having observed the terrible effects upon many it was decided to investigate the literature upon the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is apparent that much has been published for the medical profession only. It is rare that one can secure a magazine or other periodical which gives the laity information along this line. A splendid start was made, however, in 1929, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health Culture</span><span class="font4"> (New York), which gives the following timely warning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ASPIRIN PERIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Set the following words, if you please, Mr. Printer, in all the panoply of black type. They were spoken by Dr. Thomas M. Dishington, president of the British Homeopathic Congress, held in London last month, and it would be impossible to exaggerate their significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There were more deadly drugs taken per head of the population today than ever before in the world’s history. Five hundred tons of aspirin were consumed in one year in our country, and to judge from the amount of expensive advertising of other drugs, this sapping of the vitality of our race was a more than ordinarily profitable business. Deaths were common from overdoses or from errors in dispensing, yet we are complacent. Today we are living in a dark hour, and this drug-consuming is the black spot on the fair page of 20th century progress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What does it all mean? Are we committing race suicide, or is this drug-craze merely a transient phase . . . ? The fact is that civilization is outstripping the capacity of human nature. Without narcotics, drugs, and stimulants we cannot stand the pace. The human machine has not yet adjusted itself to the new conditions. Speed is the desideratum in all departments of life, and the “coming race” will differ from ours inasmuch as it may be sharpened up or blunted down in all its senses, according to the new circumstances. Let us try to realize the change that has already taken place. We boast that science has enlarged the average length of life. So it has, but only by improving the figure as regards infant mortality. The babies are having the time of their lives. We love them more and more wistfully because they are the only natural human [creatures] that are left. But they will presently pass out into the hurly-burly of modern civilization, where the drug fiend awaits them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Leave out the children under fourteen and I doubt whether the average span of life is any longer than it was a hundred years ago. Sanitation and hygiene have done much to banish endemic disease, but today our ills are mental; our nerves rather than our physical organs bring us down, and the frantic haste to patch and temporize is reflected in the floods of patent medicine and the mountains of patent pills which are annually absorbed by the national stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aspirin was “discovered” about twenty years ago by a German professor, who claimed that salicylic acid gradually released into the system would pass through the digestive tract, soothing, or deadening the nerves as it proceeded, without producing any deleterious aftermath. No one pretends that there is a virulent poison in a small dose. No one denies that the nerves are temporarily relieved. The danger lies in the fact that the small dose is never sufficient; for when the effect has worn off only a stronger application will suffice, and the more powerful members of the aspirin family—heroin, veronal, phenastin, and the like—are subsequently called in to club the jarring nerves into silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let Us Be Fair</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hurrying humanity has no time to lay up. This tablet-taking is so handy, so quick; and when bread-and-butter depends on work at the office, the shop, or the factory, who wouldn’t try a short cut to health and efficiency?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alas! the principle is all wrong. Nature never hurries. We may stand aghast at the calamity, and cry “How frightful, how sudden!” but the earthquake has been hundreds of years in the making, and the avalanche started before the present generation was born. What if the debacle of white races be beginning now! We must breed, a race of super-men to withstand this riot of speed. They must draw their strength from the only reliable source, from nature, and the aspirin peril must be met, not by flinging dope and opiates to the enemy, as Ethelred flung bribes to the Danes, but by open fight, stern determination, and a changed outlook on the scope and purpose of life itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the following item under the caption “The Asp in Aspirin” it is noted that 500 tons of aspirin is used in the British Isles annually. America, no doubt, uses as much per capita as the English. The article continues in the abovenamed journal of October 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ASP IN ASPIRIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poor Cleopatra, distracted by the loss of Antony, and rebuffed by Augustus, clasped the asp to her bosom, and so died. Modern Woman, suffering grievously from Nerves, carries the asp in her handbag— the “asp” in aspirin! And, truth to tell, Modern Man too often carries the “asp” in his waistcoat pocket. At the International Homeopathic Conference, recently held in London [England] it was stated that 500 tons of aspirin are consumed in that country every year, and when we remember that each tablet contains but five grains, it should be easy for the arithmetician to tell us exactly how many million tablets this enormous bulk represents. We must always allow for exaggeration, but, subtract and discount how we may, the fact remains that the use of drugs is on the increase and the drug principally employed is aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Roughly, its action is to deaden the symptom without eradicating the cause; and since this accommodating body of ours can accustom itself to all sorts of situations, it follows that the process of “deadening” can be continued only by stunning the resilient nerves with ever-increasing doses. In Dumas’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Monte Cristo, </span><span class="font4">old General Nortier, suspecting that his “friend” desired to poison him, sets about taking small pinches of the poison himself so that his system may be impervious to the attack by the time the fatal dose shall be administered; but do not let the aspirin addict be deluded into the idea that immunity from evil consequences can be secured by adopting the same line of argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aspirin is based on acetosalicylic acid, and a “tablet” is rapidly absorbed and circulated as sodium salicylate. A moderate dose causes a more rapid heartbeat, a rise in blood pressure, and promoted perspiration, and to that extent relieves the jarring nerves, but it affords nothing that is permanently beneficial. Indeed, one authority declares that aspirin actually kills deadening pain. “Make no mistake about pain,” he says; “it is unpleasant, but beneficent. It is a flag set up by nature to warn us that something has gone wrong. Aspirin pulls down the flag, and makes people think everything is all right, till often it is too late to make it right. It conceals the symptoms; it waves aside the sore throat, the slight cough, the headache, as a thing of no consequence, and allows the disease to work under cover till it gets a grip no medical skill can break!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In other words, Nature keeps a strict Debtor and Creditor account. We are able to overdraw occasionally, but the balance must be made up sooner or later by honest retrenchment. Drugs are a spurious currency which cannot be accepted at the Bank of Health. How, then, shall we check the petty ills of life, inseparable from the hurry and turmoil of modern civilization, if the convenient little tablet is to be denied us? Those who ask the question would hardly defend drink on the ground that alcohol conquers care, and yet the analogy is there; and in the end drunkard and drug-taker reap the same unhappy fate. Nature has her remedy in both cases, but, like the orthodox practitioner, she demands her fee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The machine that we have been misusing is out of gear. We have patched it up to get to the end of the journey, and, thanks to the original soundness of the works, we have reached our destination. Before we can go any farther there must be an overhaul, and the natural thing to do is to try to understand the machine, and provide the proper fuel and lubricants it requires. Food is fuel; sleep, meditation, and the mental and bodily exercises are lubricants. Headache, insomnia, neurasthenia, neuritis, and all the tribe of nerve ailments can be lulled to rest by aspirin, but the root cause of them is our mode of life, and there will come a time when the cumulative effect of the doping will be as deadly as poor Cleopatra’s asp. Nature’s fee is paid in restraint, abstinence, fasting, exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and a recognition of our duties as well as our rights. There is a healer more benign than the asp in aspirin; it is the asp in aspiration when we make up our minds to tread nature’s path. There are two kinds of tonic, the true and the false, and the difference between taking and making trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Investigation proved conclusively that the orthodox medical profession is acquainted with the deadly poisonous effects of aspirin. Pharmaceutical houses put out literature warning against prescribing the drugs. Many patients, after teeth have been extracted and tonsils removed, find their pains continue. Aspirin is indeed frequently prescribed as a cure. The writer believes that the menace has become so great that the evil should be known by all. I will quote the &quot;Gleaner” of August 1928, published by the Lloyd Bros., Inc., pharmacists, Cincinnati, Ohio. The article was written by A. F. Stevens, M.D., and was distributed to the medical profession under the caption “Ultimate Effects of Drugs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ULTIMATE EFFECTS OF DRUGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aspirin is as staple in drug stores and department stores as cathartic pills and cotton goods. Everybody takes aspirin. Doctors give it for almost every ache and pain, everything from a cold to corns, with the assurance that the drug is harmless. During the flu period almost every victim got his aspirin. Almost everybody believed in it because it relieved his distress and “couldn’t do him any harm”. The result was that thousands died who might have lived had they been willing to bear discomfort for a little while. They died like flies around a plate of poison, although “science” did all that could be done to “save” them. May the good Lord deliver us from the science that kills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of those deaths were said to have resulted from pneumonia, but those cases of so-called “pneumonia ’ ’ coming under my observation were, in reality, a hypostatic congestion of the lungs and did not show the symptom-complex of pneumonia at all. The primary effect of aspirin is exerted upon the sensory portion of the nervous system and destroys the power of the brain to receive the sensation of pain, thereby leading the patient to believe he is improved. The pain and the cause of it are still acting, but the patient does not know it. The sensory current flows no more to the feeling organ. What else does aspirin do ? Ultimately it inhibits the vasomotor impulse, thereby destroying the contractive power of the capillary vessels. Under the influence of the drug the capillaries lose their contractile force and extreme dilation results. Having destroyed the conducting power of the vaso-motors, turned the current off, the vessels fill to their limit and never regain their power to act. The patient dies drowned in his own blood, and they call it pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I do not say that all eases of flu that were given aspirin developed this condition, but I do say that, given a case of pulmonary complication, it is a dangerous thing to give aspirin. I do not say that the drug should be entirely prohibited under all circumstances, but I do say that, knowing the ultimate effect of the drug, one should carefully select his cases for its administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be noted here that our strongest and healthiest manhood was in our cantonments during the early period of the war. Yet more than 15 percent died from a disease known as the “flu”, while during the same period only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font4"> percent of our weaklings, children and old people at home died of the same ailment. My brotherin-law who was in the army and very ill with the disease was told that he would not be alive the following day; however, he was given his regular dose of 5 tablets of aspirin, which he then and there refused. He got well, while those around him who took the drug died. Dr. Stevens admitted that “they died like flies around a plate of poison”, under their care. This is a terrible indictment against the orthodox medics in charge of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the editor of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fruitarian and Vegetarian</span><span class="font4"> read the above article he published it in full with the following comment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who is responsible for the administration of aspirin or any other drug? Is it your butcher, dressmaker, milkman, or morning newspaper? Common sense should teach people that anything that stops pain or a headache in five minutes is dangerous. But nearly every clubwoman, society butterfly and those on high tension carry something in their handbag to allay headaches, etc. On every hand we see, among such women, twitching nerves, little nervous peculiarities, apparently impossible to control. Wrong foods and habits demand something unnatural; so drugs are resorted to. The bootlegger is arrested, but those prescribing nervines and details as deadly, if not as rapid in action, as “hootch” is go free, carry titles, and the pack does homage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It might be well at the present time to investigate drug conditions. Our federal penitentiaries are filled with criminal drug addicts. More than twenty-three hundred of them are in the three prisons. One would think from current newspaper reports that they are filled with violators of the liquor laws instead. These are second in number, only slightly over eighteen hundred. These facts should cause Americans to ask: Should the public be able to buy painkilling drugs without some check upon such purchases? Let us take a calm view of the aspirin situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What are the basic reasons for our nervousness, headaches, insomnia, and a thousand other diseases like neuritis, gastric troubles, etc.? What is it in the last twenty years of modern life, other than automobiles, theaters, and airplanes, that causes these diseases which call for 500 tons of aspirin per year in England and many more tons in America? Is it our devitalized foods done up in beautiful packages which will not attract worms, mice or rats? Is it our lack of time to properly prepare foods for ingestion ? Is it our new modern method of cooking in aluminum dishes and baking with alum baking powders? Is it our city faucet drinking water which is loaded with chlorine and aluminum mixed with sulphuric acid? Is it our white bread made with portions of plaster of Paris and other poisonous ingredients? No doubt all of these have a direct bearing upon our general well-being. The writer has found that many scientists have determined that aluminum is absorbed into the blood when ingested, and that this is one of the great sources of body evils, producing diseases which require drugs to control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Harry Gideon Wells, pathologist, of the University of Chicago, states under oath that aluminum compounds cause the red corpuscles to aggregate or clump in the capillaries of the body, causing an anemic condition arising from the reduction of the red corpuscles. Along with this condition comes a whole train of diseases due to the lowered vitality of the body which calls for aspirin, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">aspirin!</span><span class="font4"> more aspirin! May the good Lord deliver us from a science of murder as generally practiced today by prescribing aspirin.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>The Purpose of All Creation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“T 00K across the street, will you! Two gangs of yelling youngsters.” You hear the leader of one gang cry out, “I am Dillinger!” while the other gang leader shouts, “I am Mussolini!” The youthful ruffians begin gouging one another’s ribs with pointed sticks and clubbing one another with butts of toy guns and pistols. You are startled at this sudden explosion of youthful dynamite, but then you smile on it as being only a playful expression. Still, afterwards, you are led to believe it is born in the heart of a child to worship some hero, somebody he can imitate. This same spirit to worship something or somebody bursts out at national athletic games. Thousands stand on tiptoes, shouting at the top of their voices as their baseball team or hero brings in the run that ties the score. At football contests the spectators become literally wild, and crowds cry out like hoodlums as their gridiron hero carries the pigskin twenty yards for a touchdown. Election and wartime scenes display a like burning in the hearts of millions to follow an idolized leader. For such honoring and worship of a creature man whole armies have been sacrificed on battlefields, women have debauched themselves, and even children have made up games for pastime. One cannot doubt that there is something in man’s heart and mind which impels him to worship somebody. But the question is, Has man found the proper somebody to worship!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Examination of the Scriptures relative to creation discloses that man was placed on earth for the pleasure of the Creator, Jehovah, and to worship Him. (Revelation 4:11) Had man remained in harmony with Jehovah, the purpose of man’s existence would even now be realized by his praising and worshiping the Most High. Due to rebellion, however, God’s enemy has turned many creatures away from the great Benefactor, and the object of creation has been hid and greatly misunderstood. The Devil, realizing that man desires to worship some person or thing, has turned the attention of the human family away from Jehovah and caused the creatures to bow down to anything else than the Creator, who is worthy of all honor and godly fear. The human family has been blinded to the existence and the good purposes of Jehovah. The Devil is responsible for this condition. A time must come, however, when the blinding influence cast over the minds of the people will be removed, and all who desire to know and worship Jehovah will be at liberty to do so. Then the purpose and objective of all creation will be realized in the unending songs of praise to Jehovah. That objective could not be realized under the unrighteous reign of the enemy, but awaits the vindication of Jehovah’s name in His righteous kingdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>All God’s Works Shall Praise Him</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing the purpose of His works and the intimate relationship of the Kingdom to the accomplishment of that purpose, Jehovah caused the psalmist to write: “All thy works shall praise thee, 0 Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.” (Psalm 145:10-13) Millions of creatures have not known Jehovah heretofore, and it is impossible for such creatures to worship the true God. When the creature comes to an appreciation of who Jehovah is, and of man’s relationship to his Benefactor, at that time, and not before, does he become wise. No creature can be wise who does not know the purpose of existence; he is wise indeed who bends all his powers to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can now understand why there is so much discontent, disappointment and sorrow in the world today; and furthermore, we can now understand why even some who vowed to do God’s will, becoming restless, have been turned aside by the wily enemy and forsake the path of righteousness. These conditions are caused either by not realizing the purpose of creation or because, having once learned the real work to be done, many have been led by the enemy into side lanes and the doing of those things which are foreign to the real work that God would have His people do at this time. There may be many apparently worthwhile enterprises in the world, a show of public benefit may allure many to take a slight departure from the right course, or the temporary gratification of personal pleasures may draw one into the paths of temptation. One cannot pursue a course pleasing to the Lord and chase the butterflies of one’s own fancy. The question is not of what may temporarily please creatures or even benefit them. The real issue is, What is pleasing to the Lord? He who understands and appreciates the Creator’s purpose must also persist in following a course consistent therewith.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Good Intentions Not Sufficient</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">If one realizes the purpose of all creation to be to praise and magnify the great God and persists in following a course consistent therewith, he cannot go wrong. It is what Jehovah wishes done, not what we wish done, that is the allimportant thing. Right in this connection, while considering the proper thing to be done we cannot let even our good intentions be a safe guide in a course of action. Undoubtedly the path to destruction is paved with the glittering stones of good intentions. You will recall how Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark when the oxen stumbled. Uzza’s intentions so far as he wished to keep the ark on the cart may have been good, but he was disobeying the command of the Lord, because he was not a Levite. (1 Chronicles 13: 9,10; 15: 2) On account of his disobedience the Lord smote him to death. The Kingdom work requires that we obey the Lord’s commandments, and only as we do His bidding are we doing those things that are praiseworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course there is much suffering in the world today because the people do not realize the purpose of all creation. The temporary spurt of selfish activity only leads to disappointment when one discovers that his hopes are blasted and his efforts have been in vain. The real reason for so much discontent is that man is not doing what he was created to do. A creature realizes his greatest efficiency and happiness when he zealously does those things that he was designed to do. What would the Lord have me do? How can I praise and honor my Maker? These are questions of paramount importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this time there are numerous creatures on earth, also there are creatures invisible to man, who do not appreciate that Jehovah is the true God; and without faith and love for the great Creator it is impossible to either please Him or serve Him. Jehovah’s witnesses at this time throughout the earth are putting forth every effort that the people might have an opportunity to know something about Jehovah, that in due time they too might in turn serve the great Benefactor. We see, therefore, the great necessity for the vindication of the name of Jehovah at the outset of the Kingdom arrangement. Those who love the Lord desire that His name be vindicated. The vindication of Jehovah’s name comes at a time of judgment and the manifestation of the great power of the Almighty. When the people of the earth appreciate the righteous judgments of the Lord and learn of His goodness, then they will praise Him for ever. In Isaiah 26:8,9 we read: “Yea, in the way of thy judgments, 0 Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are numerous creatures both visible and invisible who have rebelled against the Most High. Satan has used wicked angels to cause both angelic sons of God and mankind to be drawn away from the course of righteousness; these seduced ones are temporarily in the snares of the evil one. Satan and his wicked agents must be put to death in the early part of the Kingdom in order that God’s judgments may be accomplished and in order that the obedient creatures may be untrammeled in their service and praise of Jehovah. This is accomplished at a time when the name of Jehovah is brought to the fore. Speaking words of encouragement and assurance the witnesses of Jehovah now on earth say: “Through thee will we push down our enemies; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.”—Psalm 44: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection let it be emphasized that all men should trust in the Lord, and not in the arm of flesh. Man has a power greater than his own with which to combat; he has powerful spirit creatures to resist if he wishes to be pleasing to Jehovah. No man on earth is able to fight single-handedly against the Devil and expect to be pleasing to the Lord. Therefore, if man wishes to battle against the enemy he must rely upon a power superior to that at the command of Satan. The Lord Jehovah is much more powerful than the Devil. It is pleasing to the Lord when man trusts Him, and Jehovah is a strong fortress to those who flee to Him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>Blessed Is He Who Trusts God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">No man has any right to boast in his own prowess; but if he boast, let it be in the Lord. In point we read from Jeremiah 17: 5-8: “Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in mftn, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is: for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Creator is the source of all power, and He will abundantly manifest that power in the coming battle of Armageddon in the vindication of His name. His wondrous works at that time will cause all to tremble, and those who love Him will give Him thanks because of His judgments and the righteous execution thereof. “Unto thee, 0 God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare; The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved.” (Psalm 75:1,3) The righteous do not fear the coming wrath against the Devil’s organization, but rather pray for it. When the present unrighteous organization is dissolved, a new kingdom of equity will hold sway in all the earth; the creatures will come to a recognition of things as they should be, and the hearts and hands of all the obedient will rejoice in the works of their Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this time of trouble and uncertainty that is upon all nations of the earth the best thing for all to do is to call upon the name of the Lord; He is the only one on whom to rely, and His organization will provide protection in this time of distress. As Jehovah manifests His power and His strange act in vindication of His name, the peoples of the nations who will survive (and there will be millions of people of good will toward Jehovah’s witnesses) will worship before the true God and glorify His name. This, indeed, will be a time of great joy among all obedient creatures and will make the heart of Jehovah glad. There will be a new start in earth’s affairs, a new day in which the human family will prosper in those things which are pleasing to the Lord, and the creatures will realize the purpose of existence in the everlasting praises of Jehovah. “Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, 0 Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, 0 Lord; and shall glorify thy name. For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.”—Psalm 86:6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Never-to-be-For gotten Event</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having noted a number of scriptures which clearly point out to us that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated at the very outset of the new kingdom, we can now appreciate the fact that when the people know the Most High they will praise Him by their words and actions. When He has put down the enemy by His Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and manifested His indisputable supremacy the people will praise His greatness and majesty. So impressive will be the display of His power and His mighty acts in the battle at Armageddon that these will never be forgotten; one generation (Jehovah’s witnesses) shall tell the memories of Jehovah’s acts to the other generation (God’s faithful prophets and witnesses before Christ) who will be awakened from the graves. “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.” (Psalm 145:3-7) The people will be overjoyed in the goodness and blessing of Jehovah, because He will treat them in a manner different from what they have experienced under the hand of the cruel enemy. The joy which the people will have in their hearts will overflow in the praises which will ever be upon their lips to the honor of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From Darkness to Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After man was created and placed in the garden of Eden the law was given to him, the keeping of which would have insured the favor of God and His blessing. On account of disobedience the people have been overreached by the enemy and have been blinded as to what the law of God really is. In the Kingdom this veil which has been cast over all the nations will be lifted, and the people will see what is pleasing to God and will do it. “And in this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will destroy in this mountain [kingdom] the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.”—Isaiah 25: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the people are merely existing, nations are submerged in poverty and ill health. The oppression of the enemy has broken the desire and health of mankind. Like an old man, the human family goes tottering to the grave. Jehovah never purposed that obedient man should die; neither does He take pleasure in the death of the wicked. Health, life, joy and righteousness will be given the obedient of the people to the end that they may sound forth His praises. Now note the Scriptures: “That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. 0 let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.”—Psalm 67: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has made the earth for man, and has so constructed the materials thereof to supply the common necessities and to sustain life. During the reign of evil, selfish men have obtained possession of the mines and the oil fields of the earth, and have exploited the people with these necessities of life. The wheat, corn and other grains have passed from producer to consumer by way of restrictive tariffs to support the idle rich. The giant skyscrapers in our large cities, and which represent the hard-earned dollars of millions of people, have really been reared on the backs of the laboring masses. The ponderous systems of government, with their many useless bureaus, politicians, grafters and armies, have really been playing into the hands of the privileged few and have resulted in the undoing of the people. “When the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” (Proverbs 29: 2) “Behold, I am against thee, 0 destroying mountain [the Devil’s destructive organization], saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.”—Jeremiah 51:25.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>An Abundant Yield</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Things will be reversed under the kingdom of the Creator. The Lord will teach the people how to rehabilitate the earth and repair the ravages caused by the greedy hand of the enemy. Scientists have been trying to improve the land for the benefit of the profiteers, but the Lord will actually increase the fertility of the land as one of the sure blessings of the people. When the crops of a righteous man are plenteous he desires to express his gratitude to the Lord and the Giver of all good things. When the people recognize the abundant provision of the Creator they will fear Him and hoiior Him. “Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase ; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.”—Psalm 67: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the purpose of the Creator that all His works should praise Him. This includes both the animate and the inanimate works of His creation. Undoubtedly as one appreciates the wonders of creation with the wisdom which the Lord has provided such objects will arouse admiration for the Creator. Heretofore the people, under the reign of Satan, have been kept in the darkness concerning an appreciation even of the wonders of the visible universe. Evolution and the wisdom of man have purposely left out of account the great Benefactor of the people; the Devil’s design has ever been to keep them from the truth about the Creator. When man learns the truth and appreciates the great Giver, then Jehovah will take pleasure in the devotion, praise and service of His earthly creature. We might expect that there is a vast reservoir of knowledge about the Creator’s works yet unfathomed, and which science falsely so called either has not disclosed or has so twisted as to give an entirely wrong impression of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Glory in the Heavens</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Studying the glory of the heavens and the laws by which the stars and the planets are held together and move through space with such precision and regularity, one is astounded at the wisdom and power of the Creator. One will also marvel at how the Creator uses the mighty deep, fire, hail, snow, vapor and the stormy wind to fulfil His word. These things Jehovah makes and uses in a manner strange and wonderful to man. They do not function by mere chance, but will certainly be used marvelously to accomplish the will of their Maker and Governor. Even by the sane consideration of the Scriptures and our limited knowledge of the visible universe through the distorted spectacles that we now have, one can see the utter foolishness of man worship, or, for that part, any other worship than that of the Creator, the God of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole of the 148th Psalm gives us a picture of the marvels of creation doing honor to Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth: “Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that bo above the heavens. Let them praise the name of Jehovah: for he commanded, and they were created. He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men and maidens; old men and children: let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>

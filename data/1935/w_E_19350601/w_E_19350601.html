<p><span class="font1">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Act of March 3, ISIS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTORY AND OFFICE CLOSED—JULY 27-AUGUST 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All publishers afield will please take notice that the Bethel home, factory and office at Brooklyn will be closed from July 27 to August 11 inclusive. This will afford the members of the Bethel family opportunity to get away from the regular routine work and enjoy field privileges with their brethren. Because of this no shipments of literature will be made to anyone during that time. You will therefore please get your orders into the Brooklyn office in sufficient time for handling and filling before the shipping department shuts down. Be sure to order sufficient literature to carry you through the two weeks mentioned above as well as to the end of August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please do not write letters to the Society during this closed period, as there will be no one here to answer them. It is hoped that during the period from July 27 to August 11 the only mail that will be received will be the regular service reports and the mail which accumulates because of responses to the radio lectures, as well as renewals of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font1"> We hope to be able to give this immediate attention on the reopening of the factory, and such other mail as is urgent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPHS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his own chosen time, and when his enemies are desperately trying to limit his witnesses on earth in getting the truth to the people, Jehovah has provided another effective instrument for the kingdom proclamation, to wit, a portable phonograph equipped with electrically transcribed records of 4$-minute speeches by Brother Rutherford on vital Bible topics. Reports to date from pioneers and others already equipped with and using this phonograph attest the success and potency of this method of introducing and driving home the Lord’s message. The machine is manufactured by the Society at its Brooklyn factory, and is specially designed for its work, and is the best available for the purpose. Strong, compact, with a powerful spungwound motor, and carrying space for several discs, it weighs 21 pounds with six discs bearing twelve recordings. To cover the bare cost the phonograph, with 18 recordings, may be had for $19.25. All orders therefor, remittance accompanying, should be sent to the Brooklyn office of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has made arrangements to construct and assemble portable transcription machines at our own factory at 117 Adams Street. These machines are somewhat different in construction from those previously furnished. They will be spring-wound, and operated from a 6-volt wet-cell battery. Every machine will be furnished complete with the battery and a battery charger, so that it can be kept up to its full stiength. We are pleased to announce that this machine can be offered at $100, complete, to brethren in the United States.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SEEKING KNOWLEDGE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart: and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil,”—Prov. 3: 5-7,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH has gathered unto himself his saints and brought them into the covenant for the kingdom. Thus he has taken out from amongst men a people for his name; and now he assembles them at the temple, and these are instructed by the Lord Jesus Christ. The information given to the remnant at the temple is first for their own comfort and strength, and then the Lord sends them forth to declare what they have learned, that they may thereby bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. This is the day of vindication, and the witnesses of the Lord must declare the “vengeance of our God”. They being commissioned to do this work, there is no excuse for failing to do it. (Isa. 61:2) By performing their commission without fear of man or devil, and doing so boldly, the remnant show their faith in and love for God and his King.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD WOE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The remnant, pictured by Habakkuk, standing on watch and now being in the secret place of the Most High, make proclamation of the third “woe” declared by Jehovah against Satan’s organization. “Woe to him that buildeth a town [Hebrew: Zr] with blood, and stablisheth a city [symbol of an organization] by iniquity [wrong-doing, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser]</span><span class="font2">!” (Hab. 2:12) The first city built was stained with human blood unrighteously shed. “And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, . . . after the name of his son, Enoch.”—Gen. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> The Hebrew word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ir,</span><span class="font2"> in the above text rendered “city”, means a place guarded by waking or a watch. Cain had fallen to the Devil, and his city he builded under the direction of the Devil. After the flood Satan began to build his earthly organization, using Nimrod as the visible leader or city-builder. (Gen. 10: 9-12) The cities here mentioned are the first to be mentioned after the deluge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> It was to Abraham God made the promise that in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. In striking contrast with Satan’s building, Abraham, the servant of God, had no part in the city-building with Satan. “For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.” Abraham and his sons Isaac and Jacob desired a “better country [than Satan’s organization], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.” (Heb. 11: 10,16) Those faithful men will be a part of God’s organization administering to the people in righteousness during the reign of the great Messiah. As Israel professed to be the people of God, so ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ claims to be God’s chosen ones; but “Christendom” has been built by wrongdoing, by fraud, deceit and distortion, and by the shedding of human blood, and concerning the city “Christendom” God’s prophet says: “They build up [professed] Zion [which ‘Christendom’ claims to be, God’s organization] with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.” (Mic. 3:10) By his prophet Ezekiel God says to “Christendom”: “Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! . . . For her blood is in the midst of her. . . . Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.”— Ezek. 24: 6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> That great city “Christendom” has been built chiefly ‘by the iniquity of traffic’. (Ezek. 28:18; sec </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 103) Commerce has been and is the chief pillar of this bloody “city” or organization. Crooked politics has helped with the building by enacting laws favorable thereto, and the hypocritical clergy have sanctified the whole thing by falsely claiming the building to be according to the will of God. Built up by fraud, wrongful scheming, conquest, oppression and robbery, and the shedding of much blood, that wicked organization deserves the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, and God has ordained that it shall be destroyed. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire foretells “Christendom’s” complete annihilation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">* As further proof concerning the fulfillment of this prophecy in the last days the words “Jehovah of hosts” are used in the prophecy, and such words always refer to Jehovah as the great Warrior. “Be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">hold, i&amp; it not of the Lord [Jehovah] of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire [for the fire, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.; </span><span class="font2">for insecurity, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.,</span><span class="font2"> margin], and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?”—Hab. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ The fire mentioned at this point in the prophecy could not refer to the present-day economic depression, famines, pestilences, and the like, because the ruling factors, not being touched by such calamities, would be exempt. On the contrary, it is the fire of “Jehovah of hosts”, “the fire of [his] jealousy,” by which he will destroy the entire building, that is, the whole of Satan's organization. (Zeph. 3:8) Everything for which they labor will be consumed in the great fire of Armageddon. The city having been built contrary to God’s law and as a reproach to his holy name, all parts of the organization or building are for the huge bonfire of the “day of God Almighty”, and “Christendom” has no fire insurance that will afford protection or relief. “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.” (Zeph. 1:18) “A fire gocth before him, and burnetii up his enemies round about. ’ ’—Ps. 97: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">•<sup>8</sup> What Jehovah said back there to Jerusalem applies with greater force and effect to ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, and now to‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ he says: ‘ ‘ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.” (Jer. 4: 4) “And the people shall be as the burnings of lime; as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.”—Isa. 33:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> That it is the will of God that all peoples of ‘ ‘ Christendom” shall hear what is about to come to pass, take note of the words of Jehovah’s prophet, to wit: “Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and ye that are near, acknowledge my might. The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites: Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that dcspiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stop-peth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure. ’ ’—Isa. 33:13-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Satan’s entire organization shall be devoured. “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary [trying to extinguish the blaze].”—Jer. 51: 58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> As God overthrew and devastated Sodom and Gomorrah, so shall he do unto “Christendom” and every part of Satan’s organization. (Jer. 50: 40) Jehovah’s witnesses, foreshadowed by the ‘man in linen’, and in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment, must go out with their hands full of coals of the fiery message and “scatter them over the city”, and thus sound the fire signals, that the people of good will may heed and flee to the only place of safety.—Ezek. 9:3; 10:2-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> Today there are divers and numerous human schemes and plans formed and put into operation, and by these schemes it is claimed that the world, and particularly ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, will be made a fit place in which to live. All of such schemes or plans of recovery and for prosperity are in vain and are certain to fail. With each new scheme that is brought forth by the rulers of the nations the leaders make much fuss and extravagant claims as to what these schemes will accomplish, and the people imagine that they are going to get relief. “Why do the heathen [nations, I?.V.] rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?” (Ps. 2;1) Because the Devil, through the earthly leaders, hoodwink the people and prepare them to believe anything. When the message of God’s truth is proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses, by which the people are informed what shall come to pass, then the rulers of the earth take violent opposition to such message: “The kings of the earth set themselves [in opposition], and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands assunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (Ps. 2: 2, 3) Therefore there is deadly conflict between the message of truth and Satan’s agents on earth. It is a fight now to the finish, and soon Jehovah will make a short work of it. “The people shall weary themselves for very vanity [for emptiness weary themselves, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.].”</span><span class="font2"> Big Business, militarism, professional politicians and hypocritical clergy stand for or are pictured as “Egyptians”, and these now make great claims concerning their plans for saving the world, but “the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose”. (Isa. 30:7) Their fighting against Jehovah will make all the enemy weary in the end. “And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.” (Jer. 51:64) Every one of earth’s population shall become faint and weary, except those who rely upon Jehovah and faithfully serve him. “Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk, and not faint.”—Isa. 40:30, 31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> The continued persecution, arrests, imprisonment and ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Devil’s representatives, and which are now being done throughout “Christendom”, would tend to make weary and faint the strongest ones if they were not permitted to receive a knowledge and understanding as to the reason for such persecutions. But since Jehovah has opened to them his prophecies and makes it clear to them why he permits them to be ill-treated, his faithful witnesses are glad that they are permitted thus to have a part in the sufferings that came upon Christ. They with the faithful apostles say: “We glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation work-eth patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.” (Rom. 5: 3-5) In order to maintain his integrity Christ Jesus suffered, and was made perfect, and now likewise the faithful remnant must suffer persecution and be faithful in order to maintain their integrity. By the grace of God they will not become weary and faint, and, continuing faithful in their devotion and service to the Lord, in due time they shall reap. (Gal. 6:9) Keep in mind that the question for final determination is that of supremacy. Shall the Devil continue his wickedness and rule, or shall Jehovah be known as the supreme and almighty One and establish a rule of righteousness? Shall the name of Jehovah be for ever defamed, or shall his holy name be vindicated? For centuries past the earth has been “filled with violence”, and Satan’s organization and every part thereof is smeared with blood unrighteously shed, and soon Satan and his organization shall be completely annihilated. “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font2"> by knowing the glory] of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Hab. 2:14) A knowledge of the truth will make manifest the glory, weight and supremacy of Jehovah God. This does not mean that during the thousandyear reign of Christ the earth will gradually be filled with a knowledge of God’s glory. At Armageddon Jehovah will fill all the earth with the unmistakable manifestation of his supremacy and terrible power, weight and greatness of himself, and thereby make all creation know that Jehovah is the Most High. Jehovah’s witnesses now spread the gospel message throughout “Christendom” by radio, by books and by other means, but that is a very small matter compared with what shall come to pass at Armageddon and which will disclose the glory of Jehovah. Before the thousand-year reign of Christ begins all must know that Jehovah God is supreme. Satan’s organization must be destroyed that all may know. Upon this point God caused his prophet to write: “Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> In Habakkuk 2:14 the word “glory” means “weight; honor”; honor(ablc) to prevail. “The knowledge of the glory of Jehovah” certainly means that all creation shall know of his supremacy, his honor, the greatness of his name, because he shall prevail at Armageddon. It will be to Jehovah’s glory to destroy the wicked host of Gog and Satan. “And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 38:22,23) “So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more; and the heathen [nations, R.P.] shall know that Lam the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.”—Ezek. 39: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> By his prophet Jehovah emphasizes the fact that it is at Armageddon that he will cause all creation to know that he is Jehovah the Most High. More than sixty times the prophet Ezekiel uses the words: ‘And they shall know that I am the Lord.’ “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” (Isa. 40: 5) The word “together” used in this quoted text is defined by a recognized authority as “a unit, i.e., unitedly”, all together, at one time. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong') </span><span class="font2">That one time is at Armageddon, and not at the end of the millennial reign of Christ. The text docs not say that all creation shall serve Jehovah, but that all shall see the manifestation of his supreme power, his weight and his honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> “As the waters cover the sea” is the language used by Habakkuk, whereas in the Genesis account the waters are said to be “waters in the seas”. (Gen. 1: 22) The language of Habakkuk seems to be symbolic and refers to the people. “The sea” represents the masses of humankind which Satan has alienated from God and upon which Satan’s organization has been sitting and dwelling. (Rev. 13:1; 17:15; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font2">Book Two, page 107) “0 thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.” (Jer. 51:13) The masses of mankind have been kept in ignorance of Jehovah, and therefore have not known and believed that Jehovah would manifest his glory at Armageddon; but when Armageddon is fought all creation, including those who have been in total ignorance, shall come to know that it is the power of the Supreme One, whose name is Jehovah, the Almighty God, that has done this great and terrible thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1T</sup>“Thcy that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.” (Ps. 107: 23, 24) This means that the commercial giants, as well as others, shall come to know the glory of Jehovah God, and this they will learn at Armageddon. This text could not mean that the knowledge w’ill be “sea deep”, as some have suggested, but it docs mean that this knowledge will be known universally, that all will come to know that Jehovah is God. The peoples of the earth will not need to wait for the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses to bring them the knowledge of God after Armageddon is over, but what .shall come to pass at Armageddon will furnish to all a knowledge of the supremacy of Almighty God. This gospel of the kingdom is now being preached merely as a witness or testimony; and when this is done, then shall the end come, which end will be the greatest of all tribulations, and which tribulation will make manifest that Jehovah is the Almighty, the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH WOE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> Men who have been ambitious to build empires, and have built the same, have been filled with and moved by the spirit of Satan to accomplish their selfish desires. Such ambitious, selfish and cruel ones have stopped at nothing. When these ambitious ones found that fraud, deceit, oppression, torture and other cruel punishment of their fellow creatures would further their schemes, then these unrighteous things have been quickly employed and the clergy have been right there to do their part in blinding the people and consorting with and helping the commercial giants and dishonest politicians to carry out their schemes. Jehovah God has not been unmindful of these things, and gives assurance that he will not permit them to pass unnoticed. The fourth “woe” announced is directed against these wicked ones: “Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!” (Hab. 2:15) Jehovah has commanded every honest man to love his neighbor as himself. (Matt. 19:19; Lev. 19:18; Rom. 13: 9, 10) That means that men must not take advantage of their fellow creatures, but that they should deal openly, freely and honestly with one another, and be diligent to avoid doing injury to another. The selfish empire-builders have wholly ignored this divine rule. Contrary to God’s command, these ambitious ones have dulled the sense of their fellow men and, figuratively speaking, put them to sleep by making them drunk in order that they might carry out their fraudulent schemes. The policy of such has been to accomplish their purpose by honest means if such seem to be expedient, but, above all things, to accomplish what they desire. The rights and privileges and feelings of others are not considered for a moment. This wicked course is here illustrated by the designing one’s giving “his neighbour drink”, that is, a potion handed to his neighbor that advantage might be taken of him. This he does against his neighbor’s will, and, thus stupefied, men are easily robbed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> A good man could with propriety hand his neighbor a glass of good wine; but these selfish, ambitious empire-builders carry in their hip pocket bottled poison and, says the prophet, ‘ ‘ that puttest thy bottle to him,” not as a friendly act, but with a malicious motive of taking advantage of him. Says the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version:</span><span class="font2"> “That addest thy venom </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[margin: </span><span class="font2">fury].” The ambitious empire-builders have not hesitated at any time to take advantage of their fellow creatures in order that they might obtain control over and rule the people. They would make the people drunk and stupefied, that they might be kept in complete subjection so that the power of the selfish, ambitious ones might not be disturbed. During the World War those selfish, ambitious ones did those very cruel things to men and women who were consecrated to do the will of God. And why is this wicked course taken? To the end that “thou mayest look on their nakedness”; “to the end thou mayest gloat over their parts of shame.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> These wrongful and wicked acts are committed against unsuspecting people, and are committed by the ambitious empirebuilders that their vaulting ambition may be appeased. Striking illustrations of this are had in modern times. In Italy the ambitious Mussolini forces his will upon the people. It is true that he is not the only one, but he is the figure put in front and used by other ambitious ones to accomplish the purpose in that land. In Germany a so-called ‘emergency’ arises and the figurehead who acts as the leader, by orders and decrees and threats of violence and other like things, drives the people to do the will of the selfish empirebuilders. In carrying out their wicked purpose, assaults are made upon God’s faithful ones and many of these have been forced to march in processions through the streets with placards pinned upon them, stripped almost naked, and humiliated and made to appear unpresentable and disreputable in the eyes of others. Thus the ambitious ones have caused the nakedness of men and women to appear in order that they might satiate their cruel ambition. During the World War methods of this kind were employed, and by reason of such cruel treatment some who professed to follow the Lord fell away from following after Christ Jesus, while others remained faithful and true. The wicked persecution is now being applied in some countries, particularly in Germany, and this is putting to a crucial test all who have covenanted to do the Lord’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> The dictators that have come into power since the World War are really tools of others behind the scenes. These dictators at the instance of Satan attempt to turn all men away from God and his kingdom. In Italy, Austria and Germany all manner of cruel methods are used to compel persons to do the bidding of the few who rule and control. The announced dictator is merely a tool in the hands of stronger ones which attempt to compel persons to ‘drink the strong drink handed to them’. That means that these empire-builders and selfish leaders attempt to compel all the people to conform to their theories and doctrnes and to teach and to follow a course of action which these dictators mark out. Those who refuse the venomous potion handed to them are arrested, thrown into concentration camps, marked as outcasts, driven with whips through the streets with their clothing torn, and are otherwise held up to ridicule, scorn and contempt. The purpose of such ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses is to break down their integrity toward God. In many of the nations of “Christendom”, at the instance of the clergy, who act under the di-reetion of Gog and Satan, the attempt is made to force this symbolic venomous strong drink to the lips of those who serve Jehovah God, and this they do to destroy the integrity of God’s children toward him and to bring them into shame before others. But let all those who love Jehovah God and trust him implicitly know that the enemy shall not succeed. For their aid and comfort the Lord God now gives to his children a knowledge and understanding of his prophecies. Setting these prophetic statements alongside the physical facts, the faithful are strengthened in hope and are enabled to maintain their integrity toward God. The enemy will continue to shove the cup of strong drink and wickedness into the face of Jehovah’s witnesses and thereby try to make them unfaithful in the service of the Lord, and to bring them into shame before others of the world. But the enemy shall fail in their efforts, because Jehovah’s witnesses are under the hand of the Most High and have been commissioned to declare his message and this they will continue to do. (Isa. 51:16) “For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.”—Ps. 125:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> The people of good will, who are called “Jona-dabs”, will come in for their part x&gt;f the persecution also at the hands of the enemy, because Satan hates all who serve Jehovah. All these who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah God must continue to faithfully serve him and trust him, and those who thus seek to know and to do his will God will deliver from the hands of the enemies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> “ Christendom, ” and particularly the religionists, are a shameful lot. No one has any real confidence in them, and such the prophet foretold, when he uttered these words: “Thou art filled with shame [contempt from Jehovah and his organization] for glory [thou art sated with contempt more than glory, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.;</span><span class="font2"> thou art filled with shame instead of glory, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lceser]</span><span class="font2"> : drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the Lord’s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.”—Hab. 2:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>23</sup> The latter rendering more clearly states the matter. Instead of glory they are objects of shame. The rulers, and particularly the clergy, are not now proud of the record they made during the World War, and when Jehovah’s witnesses call attention to the unfaithful and wicked deeds committed then and continuously since, then the clergy and their allies feel a stinging shame because they are exposed, and hence they endeavor to prevent the publication of the truth of and concerning their acts during the war, their unfaithfulness to God, and their connection with the Devil. They find no glory in the record they have made and are making. They persecute Jehovah’s witnesses because these speak the truth of God’s record, which truth they do not wish to hear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> The climax of the filling of the clergy and their allies brimful with shame and contempt is yet future, and that will be done by the hand of Christ Jesus, whom Nebuchadnezzar pictured when God used him, in respect to those now making up the ruling elements of the earth. The king of Assyria was used by the Lord as a means of punishing the wicked Egyptians: “So shall the king of Assyria. [God’s executioners] lead away the Egyptians [the visible ruling element of the world] prisoners, and the Ethiopians [friends of this world, that is, those who support the oppressors] captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame [nakedness] of Egypt.”—Isa. 20:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>25</sup> Christ Jesus will make these “roosters” appear ridiculous and shameful. Therefore says the prophet Habakkuk (2:16) to this cruel crowd: “Drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered.” They will be compelled to drink from the “cup of Jehovah's right hand”; as it is written: “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink ii. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.”—Jer. 25:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>26</sup> Says Habakkuk: “Drink thou also, and be as one uneircumcised.” (Verse 16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> “And expose thy person.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> The ruling elements of “Christendom”, and particularly the clergy, have never heeded God’s commandments given to all who covenant to do his will, to wit, to “circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked”. (Deut. 10:16) “Take away the foreskins of your heart.” (Jer. 4:4) Such men, claiming to be Christians or followers of Christ, are frauds and in fact belong to the “uneircumcised Philistine” crowd. (Judg. 14:3) According to the terms of God’s covenant the leaders of “Christendom” have publicly proved their own shame, that they are not of the “seed of Abraham” through which all the nations shall be blessed, but that they are hypocrites, ‘bastards,’ cruel and wicked, and must be laid low.—Ezek. 31:18; Zech. 9: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>27</sup> Those hypocrites, who now indulge in the persecution of Jehovah's witnesses, ere long shall drink of the wrath of God. “The cup of the Lord’s right hand shall be turned unto thee.” (Hab. 2:16) “The cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall come round unto thee.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> The prophecy, as recorded by Jeremiah, shows that Jehovah by his “right hand”, Christ Jesus, hands the cup to those deserving it and in due time it will come around to each and every one of the ruling element that has indulged in oppressive practices upon the people, and particularly upon Jehovah’s witnesses. First the clergy must drink and be made to appear naked and shameful in the eyes of others. (Rev. 17:16) Then in turn all the worshipers or supporters of the devilish organization must drink from the cup of God’s fury. (Rev. 1-1: 8-11; Isa. 51: 22. 23) The result of that drinking will be a terrific pain in the stomach and iu the head of the crowd of the oppressors, and they shall have a terrific siek-headache. &quot;And shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.” &quot;And filthy spittle shall be on thy glory.” (Leeser) &quot;And ignominious filth [shall] be upon thy glory.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> &quot;And shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay)</span><span class="font2"> These different translations throw light upon the effect of this potion which they are compelled to drink. They will get a dose like unto their own medicine, yet much worse. &quot;The wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture [with no sugar in it] into the cup of his indignation” must be drunk at Armageddon. That will make them sick unto death. To that crowd, which now cruelly persist in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, shall in due time drink be handed and result to their own destruction; and that shall be their end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> &quot;For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain [by the persecution of my servants], so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been. ’ ’ (Obad. 16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> &quot;And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her [Babylon’s, that is, the rulers in Satan’s visible organization] captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King whose name is the Lord of hosts. ’ ’—Jer. 51: 57.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> When we always keep in mind that Jehovah caused this information to be written aforetime for the benefit of the remnant, then we may know that the Lord is bringing an understanding thereof to the remnant at the present time that they may be fortified against the continued assaults of Satan’s agents now on the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>80</sup> It is against God’s kingdom class that the ruling elements in &quot;Christendom” have committed so much and utterly inexcusable violence. &quot;For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.” (Ilab. 2:17, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> The name &quot;Lebanon” means &quot;white”, and applies to the mountain range; and it being a part of God’s &quot;holy land”, the violence to or against it is here mentioned by the prophet. The violence to Lebanon would indicate the destruction of its noble evergreen trees. Such violence done to Lebanon relates to the wickedness of &quot;Christendom’s” leaders who have put ‘that bottle of venom’ to their neighbor’s mouth. (Vs. 15) This they have done that Jehovah’s witnesses might be made drunk and exposed to the ridicule and contempt of others and that they might lose their integrity toward God. The trees of Lebanon involved in this prophecy therefore represent primarily Jehovah’s witnesses, who are &quot;trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah”. (Isa. 61:3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> Against these trees the enemies have lifted up axes and other deadly weapons and have desperately attempted to destroy the work of Jehovah’s people as well as the witnesses themselves. (Ps. 74:5-7) The wood in Solomon’s temple was principally of the cedar brought from Mount Lebanon. (1 Kings 5:2-18) God uses these cedar trees from Mount Lebanon to picture his chosen ones against whom Satan has hurled his wicked darts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>31</sup> A boomerang comes back and strikes the one throwing it. Likewise, says the prophet Habakkuk, the violence inflicted upon Jehovah’s witnesses (the cedars of Lebanon) by their persecutors shall come back and strike against those who have hurled missiles at the faithful ones, and, says the prophet, therefore, &quot;Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink.” Big Business, or commerce, which has been the mainstay of Satan’s visible organization, has been slick and smooth in carrying out its wicked work, smooth as a fair heifer; and its hired strong-arm squad have been like and are like bulls, and are often called &quot;bulls” by some of their own crowd. All of these elements of Satan’s organization are in for a real drubbing, and their day of calamity is near. &quot;Egypt [the visible world under the control of Big Business] is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north [from Christ Jesus, foreshadowed by King Nebuchadnezzar, who came from the north]. Also her hired men [professional politicians and hypocritical clergy, together with the strong-arm squad and suborned witnesses] arc in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together; they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they [the hosts of Jehovah] shall march with an army, and come against her [modern Egypt, that is to say, ‘ Christendom ’] with axes, as hewers of wood. They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable. The daughter of Egypt [the present wicked commercial ruling power] shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north [the invisible armies under Christ Jesus, foreshadowed by the ‘ six men with slaughter weapons ’ or war axes that do the slaughtering of the enemy]. The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith, Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him.”—Jer. 46: 20-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>32</sup> From the language of Habakkuk used in the seventeenth verse it appears that God will then turn the wild beasts against &quot;Christendom” in the manner of executing retributive justice upon &quot;Christendom” and particularly some of her crowd. &quot;And wasting by wild beasts shall cause them terror.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font2">&quot;The ravaging of beasts shall terrify them.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay) </span><span class="font2">All nations of the earth, and &quot;Christendom” in particular, have grossly violated God’s everlasting covenant by the wanton slaying of dumb animals. (Gen. 9:1-6) They have put thfc beasts of the forest in terror by their cruel hunting them down and slaughtering them. Without cause or excuse they have spoiled and killed most of the beasts of the forest, and at Armageddon God in turn will permit the wild beasts to spoil their despoilers. The account will be squared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>33</sup> If this part of the text be restricted to a literal application, then “Christendom” shall be terrified as one is terrified by wild beasts against which he knows that he has no protection and from which there is no way of escape. The prophecy of Habakkuk 2: 8-17 shows that the “violence done to Lebanon”, that is, to God’s people, includes the shedding of men’s blood as well as other forms of violence against God’s anointed ones, and this has been done in an attempt to destroy the liberty, the rights, and the privileges of Jehovah’s witnesses and to prevent them from bearing testimony of Jesus Christ, the King, to the peoples of the land. Because of this violence God visits his retributive, justice upon those who have committed it, and this is just as certain to come to pass as it is written.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AGAINST ALL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>84</sup> The latter part of verse seventeen, according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version,</span><span class="font2"> reads: “For the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.” “Christendom,” acting as Satan’s agents and dupes, has inflicted much violence upon God’s people, particularly in Germany, Austria, Canada and New Jersey, and in other places; but in some parts of ‘ ‘ Christendom’ ’ there has been but little if any violence against Jehovah’s witnesses, and it might be said that in no place have all of Jehovah’s witnesses been subjected to violent treatment. If some who are bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah, and who have other evidence that they are of the Lord’s anointed, do not suffer actual violence or imprisonment, shall that be taken as proof that they are not of the Lord's organization? Lest some of the Lord’s children may be in doubt and thereby become discouraged because they have not actually been arrested, beaten, imprisoned or otherwise forcibly ill-treated because they were preaching the gospel of the kingdom, it seems well here to consider the question raised.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>33</sup> Christ Jesus and the members of his royal house are one. The members thereof have been taken out from the world as a people for Jehovah’s name and have been gathered into one compact company. (Ps. 50:5; Acts 15:14) With the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the gathering unto him of the faithful into the temple these are made one. (2 Thess. 2:1,2) Those of the temple class are at unity in Christ Jesus. (Eph. 4:13-16) Jehovah treats the members of his royal house as a unit, and concerning the violence heaped upon any part of the house of God the apostle of the Lord under inspiration wrote: “And whether one member suffer, all. the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. ’ ’—1 Cor. 12: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>30</sup> It is true that in some portions of “Christendom” Jehovah’s witnesses have suffered greater indignities than in other places. It is also true that in places where the greatest persecution has come upon Jehovah’s witnesses some of them have not been persecuted at all and some have been persecuted more than others. It is also true that Jehovah’s witnesses are not in good repute in any part of “Christendom”, but, on the contrary, as Jesus foretold, are hated of all nations. “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Alatt. 24:9) Every one today who is faithfully proclaiming the testimony concerning Jehovah’s name and his kingdom is looked upon with contempt by the rulers of all nations, and the reproaches that have come upon God’s name and that fell upon Christ Jesus have also fallen upon all the faithful followers of Christ as was foretold. (Rom. 15:3) Some suffer one indignity and some suffer another, but all of them suffer because of their unity in Christ and faithfulness unto God and Christ. The apostle Paul, in Hebrews 10, quoted from this prophecy written by Habakkuk, and in the text used the words that apply to the faithful ones in Christ at the present time, to wit: “But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye. were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.”—Heb. 10:32-36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>37</sup> The question each one must now answer in the proper way is, Are you consecrated and wholly devoted to God and Christ Jesus, and have you evidence that you are a child of God, and are you faithfully performing the commission given to you by Jehovah? If so, then you may be suffering, cither directly or indirectly. If directly, then you are aware of that fact. If indirectly, you are suffering because of your companionship with others who are enduring greater physical suffering for righteousness. One being in this condition, it is faithfulness to God and to his kingdom that is required. To such the words of the apostle are addressed: “Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. ’ ’—Heb. 10: 38, 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>38</sup> These latter words Paul quotes from Habakkuk’s prophecy. Let all of God’s witnesses, therefore, take courage and stand shoulder to shoulder as one man, fighting for the gospel of the kingdom, because as one suffers such suffering is counted as to all. The faithfulness of God’s people in standing together and serving Jehovah God will be an evidence to the enemy that they are in for destruction themselves.—Phil. 1: 27, 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">At this point in the prophecy there is a prelude or introduction to the fifth woe and which refers to the graven image and the maker thereof: ‘ ‘ What prof-Lieth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the makei* of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?” (Hab. 2:18) A graven image is something set up as a god or savior contrary and in opposition to Jehovah God and his Christ, who is the savior of the world. It is the plain direction of God’s Word that Sitch graven image is vanity, the work of the Devil, and in the time of his visitation shall perish. (Jer. ID: 14,15) For this reason the question is propounded: “What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it ? ” The prophecy of Habakkuk here seems to clearly identify the ‘two-horned beast’, that is to say, the Anglo-American imperialism, as the maker of the graven image. (Rev. 13:11-15) This text of Revelation, according to one translation, says: ‘And he deceiveth them that dwell upon the earth. . . . saying unto them who dwell upon the earth [the rulers thereof] that they should make an image to the wild beast.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.;</span><span class="font2"> see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One, page 293) Immediately following the World War and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah, the Anglo-American empire system did make and set up a graven image, to wit, the League of Nations, and this, together -with all of its complements, such as the World Court, and the peace treaties, and such like, is that which promises to bring peace and prosperity to the people and to save them and to act as the savior of mankind, and thus it is identified as ‘ ‘ the graven image”. The idol-making and idol-worshiping clergy of “Christendom” back up the maker of the “graven image” and endorse the image.itself and hail it in the place of God’s kingdom; and the entire crowd of “Christendom” make this devilish “graven image” to stand in the holy place, where it ought not to stand, and it is therefore the abomination that maketh desolate, which Daniel and the Lord Jesus foretold.— Mark 13:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>40</sup> “What profiteth the graven image,” and “the maker thereof”? This question is propounded. Since 1922 Jehovah’s witnesses have been asking practically this same question and have been submitting the proof by which those who desire to know may know that it profiteth nothing. “The molten image, and a teacher of lies” are words also used by the prophet. How may it be said that the League of Nations is a molten image? The Hebrew word here rendered “molten” is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">massaykaw,</span><span class="font2"> meaning “a pouring”, or “fusion” of metals; by implication, “a libation,” that is to say, 'a league.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong)</span><span class="font2"> The “molten image” is formed by pouring together or fusion of the nations of the earth. The United States is said to be no part of the League, but, on the contrary, ever since the creation of the League the United States has sent delegates to the many conferences of the League to give consideration to questions in which the United States has a vital interest. It was the president of the United States who sponsored the League of Nations. The majority of the public officials, including the United States Senate, have voted for the League of Nations. The magazines that constitute the mouthpieces of the ruling powers of the United States have no hesitancy in saying that the majority of the people are for the League of Nations. Whether their statement is true or not, the majority of the ruling elements endorse the League of Nations. To twenty-two of the conferences of the League of Nations the United States has sent delegates, and appropriated money to pay the expenses of such delegations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>41</sup> The clergy in the States and the successive presidents from its formation to this day have heartily supported the League. That “the maker thereof”, that is, of the League, trusts in it, there cannot be the slightest doubt. Said the prince of Wales at a League of Nations Union dinner: “I would ask those people ... to ask themselves, if they mistrust the League, what possible alternative they have for establishing peace and rebuilding world prosperity.” Its ardent supporters say of t]ic League: “It is the only light in the world.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>42</sup> The League of Nations is the “teacher of lies”, as the prophet says. It is based upon lies to begin with. It makes a false or lying thing and keeps it before the minds of the people and thus perpetuates the lie that such a thing as the League is the savior of the world. It is like a finger pointing to a lie, and hence is a false teacher, even though it is inanimate. It challenges the basic truth that Jehovah is the Almighty God and the Savior of the world, and puts its faith in the abominable thing in the place and stead of God’s kingdom. Continuing, the prophet says: “To make dumb idols.” Its idols are silver and gold and the works of man. All of these economic treaties, alliances, dictatorships, naval pacts, and so forth, are dumb idols. Concerning such the prophet records: “Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. 0 Israel, trust thou in the Lord; he is their help and their shield.” (Ps. 115:4,5,8,9) “For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens.” (Ps. 96: 5) The League of Nations is a dummy that the Devil uses, like a ventriloquist, and is thus made to talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>43</sup> The League of Nations shall profit nothing to the human race nor to the maker thereof. “They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their deleetable things shall not profit: and they arc their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing? Behold, all his fellows [clergy and other supporters] shall be ashamed; and the workmen, they are of men [not gods]: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed [before Jehovah] together. ... He maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.”—Isa. 44: 9-11,15,17.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>44</sup> The foolish ones worship this graven image instead of the true God and pray to it to deliver them. “I [Jehovah] have even from the beginning [the period from 1918, the coming of the Lord to the temple, to the present time, a period when worldly men have-attempted to bring about peace and prosperity] declared it to thee; before it [shortening of the day of tribulation for the elect’s sake] came to pass I shewed it thee [‘Christendom’]; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol [League of Nations] hath done them; and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. ’ ’—Isa. 48: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>45</sup> Then Jehovah states what will be the result of the controversy and what his witnesses must do before the end. “Assemble yourselves [Jehovah’s witnesses] and come; draw near together, ye that are [the remnant] escaped of the nations; they [‘Christendom’] have no knowledge [or understanding] that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save. Tell ye [my witnesses, the remnant], and bring them [the nations] near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me [not to the impotent League of Nations], and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return [swallowed], That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”—Isa. 45: 20-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>46</sup> The molten image, that is, the abomination that maketh desolate, shall completely fail; says the prophet: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give car, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.” (Isa. 8: 9,10) It shall accomplish nothing and profit nothing. Jehovah’s name must be and will be vindicated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH WOE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>47</sup> The final “woe” is due, and Jehovah’s witnesses must now make announcement to the nations and particularly advise the people of good will that they may seek the Lord and find the place of refuge. “Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.” (Ilab. 2:19) The fifth woe is against every idol-worshiping nation. These nations have given their allegiance to a Devil-made thing, and hence to the Devil; and which image is like wood, having none of the senses given to man. The earthly rulers say that the “graven image” is their savior, and to the image they say: “Awake, and act as our helper, leader and savior”; but the inanimate thing remains dumb as a log of dead wood. At this point it seems appropriate for the remnant to employ words like those Elijah used when he was taunting the devilworshipers. ‘ ‘ Cry aloud; for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves, after their manner, with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. ’ ’—1 Ki. 18 : 27, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>48</sup> This illustrates the foolish and desperate means now employed to drag the sick and depressed world out of the mire of despair. While the idol-worshipers cry unto their dumb idol, the remnant cry unto Jehovah and say: ‘ ‘ Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.” (Ps. 35:23) “Even thou, 0 Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations; be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.”—Ps. 59: 5, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>49</sup> The foolish leaders of the nations think that the “dumb stone”, the image, can teach and instruct the nations as to how to escape their present world depression, and how the desired prosperity can be brought about. In desperation they cry out to one another concerning their “dumb idol” of satanic origin and say: “It is the only light in this dark world.” Many people, being deceived, think the dumb thing can teach, and they say:. ‘Arise, this shall teach.’ Worldly dictators, commercial giants, clergy, politicians, and such like, want to hear no teaching other than from the dumb idol, the League, or some other dumb thing, and lest Jehovah’s witnesses teach the people the truth, and in order to prevent them from so doing, the rulers create strong censorship over everything, including the radio, and set up offices such as they call “Ministry of Propaganda” and excuse themselves for so doing by claiming that an emergency has arisen and that the safety of the state requires that they take such a course of action and such drastic means. The clergy of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and others of like stripe, and their political and commercial allies, may be deceived, and hence may convince themselves that censorship is necessary for the safety of the state, but they are not deceiving anyone who trusts in Jehovah God. Throughout the seventh world power, that is, the Anglo-American imperialism, as well as many other parts of the world, strenuous efforts are now being put forth to suppress freedom of speech and the freedom of the publication of truths, because the Devil is herding all nations to Armageddon and desires to keep them in ignorance of the truth; but the dictators and the suppressors of truth will come to a speedy end. “They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols. But Israel [the faithful people of God] shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.’ ’—Isa. 45: 1G, 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">•“The rulers in “Christendom” put their trust in gold and in silver, or in whatsoever that purchasing value represents, to enhance the appearance of their “dumb idol”; and to make it look more awe-inspiring and important to the people the image is ‘overlaid with gold and silver’ (Hab. 2:19), but still ‘there is no breath in the thing’, it has no spirit or power. This “graven image” thing has an international bank, with an American as president, for the settlement of disputed money claims. The Rockefeller Foundation millions with its great amount of gold has built a magnificent palace to house the “dumb idol”, and into that palace the idol has been moved. So many servants are required to care for the ‘ ‘ graven image ’ ’, covered with gold, that approximately six months are required to move all the paraphernalia into the palace that houses the dumb thing. The capitalists of the nations who rule and who control all the gold and silver approve of and worship the dumb thing and look to the League of Nations for their financial security and safety. One of the strongest proofs that the “graven image”, the League of Nations, is a dead thing, is the present-day world-wide depression. Lavishly spending of money by those who are in control of the nation does not pull the nation out of the depression. The League cannot save the world. It cannot give life, peace, happiness and prosperity to anyone. It is the “image of jealousy, which provoketh [Jehovah] to jealousy”, and the result shall be its destruction. (Ezek. 8: 3; Zeph. 3: 8) The Devil’s purpose in making this subterfuge to stand in the holy place, where it ought not to stand, is to turn aside the attention and worship and hearing and hope of the people from Jehovah God that he might lead them into destruction. The fate of that “dumb idol”, the League of Nations, will be like unto the fate of the fish god Dagon, which fell in the presence of the ark of the covenant.—1 Sam. 5:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>81</sup> Jehovah is the teacher of his own children, and never again shall their Teacher be pushed into a corner. (Isa. 54:13; 30:20) To carry out his purpose Jehovah sent his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, to the temple in 1918, and caused his prophet, now the remnant, to proclaim: “But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Ilab. 2:20, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> Any attempt to make the League of Nations, which is the abomination that maketh desolate, stand in the holy place is an open and flagrant defiance of Jehovah. The temple of Jehovah cannot be defiled, because there is nothing in common between his faithful temple class and the creature of the Devil and his organization. (2 Cor. 6:16) No one who understands God’s Word, and loves and serves him, can give support to the League of Nations, because the thing is an abomination in the sight of Jehovah. The “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” continues in the Devil’s course and ignores all the clear and plain evidence that God is in his holy temple, and makes sport of those who proclaim the truth that the Lord is at his holy temple. Such foolish ones make themselves great in their own eyes and are opponents of God and his kingdom. “Who opposeth and cxaltcth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. ’ ’—2 Thess. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>62</sup> The presence of Jehovah at his holy temple means woe to all idol-worshipers, whether that worship be of men or of inanimate things. The people of “Christendom ’ ’ now have no excuse for worshiping man-made or Devil-made things, for “the Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup.”—Ps. 11: 4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>83</sup> For this reason Jehovah and Christ do the teaching of God’s people. The dumb idol cannot teach anything. The lightning of the Lord goes forth from his temple. (Rev. 11:19) At Armageddon all creation shall know that Jehovah is the Almighty God, for then shall the earth be filled -with a knowledge of his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’‘Behold today the hypocritical and ignorant clergy, who have no knowledge and understanding of God’s Word, and their supporters and allies all calling upon the League of Nations to save them, while they tell the people that that graven image is the only light of the world. They will all be brought to shame. “As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel [‘Christendom’] ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth; for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, 0 Judah.” (Jer. 2: 26-28J_ Therefore Jehovah says: “Be silent, all the earth, before him.” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Margin)</span><span class="font2"> This language implies a time of tumult, clamor, speechifying and propaganda amongst the nations. It is said that Hitler was picked up and put in office by the commercial and religious “strong men” and made the leader in Germany because he is noted as a speech-maker or windjammer who ean sway the ignorant people and by this means can hold the attention of the people while the more powerful ones, who are out of sight, do their crooked work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>55</sup> The climax will be reached at Armageddon; hence now says Jehovah: “Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” (Ps. 46:10, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> Today the clamor and tumult increases and every effort is made by the worldly crowd to silence Jehovah’s witnesses; but Jehovah says to those who oppose him and his message: “Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice [at Armageddon], he hath bid his guests [his witnesses now on the earth]. And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel [the vestments of devil-worshipers]. In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold [ those who get possession of the homes and property of the people by mortgage-foreclosure schemes and other frauds], which fill their master’s’ houses with violence and deceit.”—Zeph. 1:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>50</sup> The command is to all the earth to “keep silence”. But that does not mean Jehovah’s witnesses, because they are specifically commanded to carry Jehovah’s message to the people. ‘ ‘ The earth, ’ ’ here used, means the official element that controls the nations of the earth and that refuses to hear the truth, but who, on the contrary, put forth strenuous efforts to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from publishing the truth. The testimony to the name of Jehovah must proceed with zeal and vigor. Why did Jehovah long ago cause his prophet to write these things? Why in this day of great stress does he now graciously permit his remnant to have a knowledge and understanding thereof ? The inspired words of the prophet give the answer: ‘ ‘ That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.”—Col. 1:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>67</sup> The fight is on, and Jehovah’s witnesses must stand steadfast to the end and battle always with patience and joy. “The joy of the Lord is your strength. ’ ’—Neh. 8:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">T</span><span class="font2">HE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God is privileged to participate in this work. Since the organization of the Society the work during the year has always been outlined in proportion as the Lord provided the money through his consecrated children. We continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appreciates the fact that this blessing came to him as </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privileges of using time, energy, and money in telling the message to others. Some who are doing as much house-to-house witness work as their conditions allow are also blessed with some money which they desire to use in the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls which they cannot personally reach might be fed upon the precious kingdom-gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used in the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much, enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Greetings to you in Jehovah’s name. I have been going to write you, expressing my gratitude in having a knowledge of the truth. It is grateful I am indeed to the Lord for using you and the Society in preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. It is just eleven years since I first read the books; and how they gladdened my heart! I was thirty-odd years in bondage to that filthy Roman Catholic system, and was in ignorance of everything pertaining to Jehovah or his kingdom. But the truth set me free, and I can truthfully say that I have been happy ever since I shook the shackles of Romanism off. I have been a full-time worker for some time now, and the Lord has' not failed in his promise. I gladly took him at his word; and what a privilege! and what a work! I know that all that is being brought to our attention in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> re the Catholic hierarchy is true. There is nothing that that crowd won’t do to gain its foul ends; but, thank the Lord, their end is in sight, and their “holy year’’ and their gold bricks will soon tumble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Well, Brother Rutherford, I will close now. Daily I pray the heavenly Father’s blessing to continue with you in his service. Sister O’H. also sends Christian love. I am</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford and Colaborers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have just read article entitled “Questions” in the March 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> and it makes me more grateful to Jehovah than I can express in words. In my humble opinion these answers convey exactly the same thoughts as all previous publications of the Society on these paiticular questions; and I feel sure this recent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> will encourage all real witnesses to take a more decided stand on all these subjects and take away the fear of wholly devoting themselves to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">May the peace of God that passeth all understanding keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Faithfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mamie</span><span class="font1"> P. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>

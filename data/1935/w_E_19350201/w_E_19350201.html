<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>JEHOVAH’S BATTLE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“For Jehovah and for Gideon.”—Judg. 7:18, A.R.V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH prepared Gideon and his army for battle against the enemies of Israel. That preparation foreshadowed what God does for his covenant people in these latter days. The record concerning Gideon’s preparation God made for the benefit of the remnant. Concerning the Israelites the record is: “Now all these things happened unto them for en-■samples; and they are written for our admonition, inon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Cor. 10:11) A knowledge and understanding of these orophetic truths proclaimed long ago and now revealed oy the Lord to his people is for their learning and brings great comfort to the anointed and makes them ■rt.rong in their hope. The faithful know that they are on the right side and that they are backed by the Lord, and therefore with courage they move forward in obedience to his commandments.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Gideon acted with caution and deliberation, and when he was sure that he was doing God’s will he b'carne strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. ‘‘Jehovah will give strength to his people; Jehovah will bless his people with prosperity.” (I’s. 2'1; 11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah prospered Gideon, and He will prosper his faithful people now. ‘‘Then Jerubbaal, -vho is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: ■o that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.”— Judg. 7:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Gideon was a challenger of Baal and hence the witness against the Devil in the great controversy as to who is supreme. Gideon, whose name means “the E ller” or ‘‘hewer down”, pictured Christ Jesus the mighty challenger of Satan, the feller or hewer-down &lt;&gt;f Satan’s great “tree”, that is, his organization, as described by the prophet Ezekiel. (Ezek. 31:1-1S) Having fully assured Gideon that he was in the right way, Jehovah then sent him forth to make preparation for the battle shortly to follow. Now the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, is sent forth with full authority </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font5">ml complete power to make final preparation for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which will hlinrtly follow and which will result in the annihilation of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Not all the people were with Gideon, but “all the people that were with him rose up early”. This corresponds with the statement of the psalmist: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110: 3) Among the people who flocked to Gideon were a lot of “suckers” or “hangers-on”, who went along with the faithful ones. Likewise today there is a faithful remnant that willingly and energetically respond to the call of the Lord and there is a company of hangers-on that march for a time near the faithful. When thc<sup>r</sup>e hangers-on sense a fight is near, they tremble with great fear and are ready to flee or to hide themsehes. Gideon and his little army pitched by the spring of Harod, meaning “palpitation, trembling”. This is the only place in the Scriptures that mention is made of the spring of Harod, and it seems quite reas&lt; liable that it was so named because of the trembling on the part of many of Gideon’s army. It was not the water that gave trembling, but the number and strength of the enemy near by, that caused many to tremble with fear. Likewise since 1S22 God has brought his people in contact with the pure waters of truth, and such as are perfect in love, and who recede the truth into pure and honest and unselfish hearts, have no fear in the presence of the enemy. (1 John 4:17,18) But there have been many who have assembled with God’s faithful remnant for the purpose of hearing the truth, and when the message of truth is made strong against the enemy and pointedly for Jehovah, making it eminently to appear that a fight is near, the hangers-on tremble with fear, and wilh soft speech and honeyed words plead that a more conservative course be taken. Such conservative course is a course of compromise and could not be pleasing to the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The assembled army of Gideon numbered only 32,000 as against four times that number of the enemy. “And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.” (Judg. 7:2) Had the 32,000 gone into action and won the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">battle, they would have been little disposed to give credit therefor to Jehovah God their Deliverer and Savior. This shows that anyone’s having a part merely in the service is not the chief and important thing, but that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is of paramount importance. Jehovah will get the victory for himself, and that to his own honor and glory. His witnesses must do their work in the strength of and to the glory of God. Jehovah did not need the men who were with Gideon to go into the battle, but he gave the faithful ones an opportunity to prove their integrity toward him and to act as his witnesses in proclaiming his name; so likewise now Jehovah does not need men to fight on his side, but he gives his faithful remnant an opportunity to be his witnesses and to maintain their integrity toward him and to have a part in the battle of the great day.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0</sup> The message of the truth must be declared within the hearing of the faithful and also within the hearing of the hangers-on and others, that the test may be had. This was foreshadowed by the proclamation which God directed Gideon to make. This is exactly in conformity to God’s commandment given by the mouth of Moses on another occasion. “When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart.” (Deut. 20:1, 8) The fearful and “weak-kneed” ones will not be faithful and true witnesses for the Lord; hence he will not send them into battle. God commanded that the fearful should “depart early from mount Gilead”. Just why the Lord mentioned Mount Gilead there is not certain, but, applying the name to the present time, it is very impressive and significant. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gilead</span><span class="font5"> means “heap of witness”, or “much testimony”. Jehu was fighting at Mount Gilead when he was anointed and sent forth to perform his complete work. (2 Ki. 9:1-3) So now, when the Greater Jehu is sent forth to battle, it is at a time when the testimony to the name of Jehovah God is at the height, and the fearful shrink or slink back and turn away therefrom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> When the army under Gideon saw the enemy hosts down in the valley<sup>7</sup> and heard the proclamation made by Gideon that the fearful should depart, many of them were frightened, and 22,000 of that number withdrew and turned back from the camp. These must picture the suckers or hangers-on, who are not in line for the kingdom but merely “meeting attenders” who hope to absorb some benefit without rendering any service, and for this reason they attend the assembly of God’s people and sit amongst them with solemn countenance. They do not bear any fruits of the kingdom and do not have any part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (For further discussion see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of 1931, page 343.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Since Jehovah has revealed to his people a knowledge of his own organization on earth and of the vast earthly organization of the enemy Satan, many who have seen this much of the truth, observing the two great opposing organizations, have become fearful because of the disparity in the numbers, and being weak in faith, they have turned back. The dividing point between the Elijah and the Elisha work of the church the Lord caused to be marked by the publication in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of the articles entitled “Blessed Are the Fearless”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> August 1 and 15, 1919) At the time of the publication thereof God’s people did not understand just the reason why, but now they are enabled to see the reason. From that time onward </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has repeatedly called attention to 1 John 4:17,18, concerning boldness in declaring the truth and the great need of fearlessness in going about God’s work and making mention of the kingdom. In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of 1927, page 246, the Scriptural proof is submitted that fear is a pestilence or destructive plague.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> When the 22,000 withdrew from camp and turned back, there remained only 10,000 of Gideon’s army, and manifestly that number pictured those who have been branches in the true vine since 1922. Not all of that 10,000 stood the test, and this foreshadows that not all of those who receive the anointing prove themselves to be faithful in the bearing of Jehovah’s fruits, that is, carriers of the waters of truth to the thirsty<sup>7 </sup>ones. As Jesus declared, the vine must be pruned some more. Likewise Jehovah gave Gideon instructions concerning a further test. “And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many, bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.” (Judg. 7:4) The enemy host now outnumbered the Israelites twelve to one, but the vindication of Jehovah’s name was not to be overshadowed by any earthly numbers. To be sure, God could have gained the victory with ten thousand as well as with any other number, but there might have been some room for boasting on the part of some of the ten thousand had the victory been gained by the Lord with that number. Above all, tne picture there being made must be true in order to foreshadow what would take place in the modern fulfilment thereof; hence God put Gideon’s army to a further test. Not all who respond to the call to the kingdom, and who get in line for the kingdom, are “chosen and faithful” ones. Only those who have received “the love of the truth”, and who continue therein, will stand the final test and receive the approval of the Lord. (2 Thess. 2:10) “Not many . . . arc called: . . . that no flesh should glory in his presence.” (1 Cor. 1:26-29) The stream of water from the well or spring of Harod pictured God’s message of “present truth”, which sets forth in unmistakable language the real issue between Satan and Jehovah and between the two great organizations. The “man of sin” or Judas class, who were once in line for the kingdom, have since scoffed and continue to scoff at the truth that God has any organization on earth at all, and still insist that the “higher powers” (Rom. 13:1) are made up of the governments of this earth and its officers, which are a part of Satan’s great organization. They scoff at the truth that the ‘ ‘ higher power's” mentioned by the Scriptures are Jehovah God and his anointed King. These conditions, which have developed in modern times, prove that it was necessary to apply the water test made by Gideon and foreshadowing the greater test of modern times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Those who give heed now to the opposing words and who are influenced by the efforts of the “man of sin” class will not stand the test in this day, but are certain to fail. (2 Thess. 2:10-12) In Gideon’s time the test was applied, not by any creature, but by the Lord himself; as he stated to Gideon: ‘ ‘ And I will try them for thee. ’ ’ This foreshadowed that in the modern times the test upon the consecrated is not applied by any creature or earthly organization, but that Jehovah God himself applies the test for the Greater Gideon, that is, Christ Jesus, who leads his army ultimately into victory.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Following the Cedar Point convention in 1922 there began a clarifying of the truth, and since then there has been an unusual clarifying of the message of truth, and this particularly began with the publication in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of the article on the “Birth of The Nation”. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> March 1, 1925.) The clarified truth has proved to be a great tester and has caused much controversy amongst those who profess to be God’s children. The words of Jehovah to Gideon show that he put the test upon the ten thousand to determine who should go with Gideon into battle. This foreshadows that Jehovah puts the test upon his consecrated people in these last days and he determines who shall go with the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus; and this is shown by the words of Jehovah: “I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee.” No man can claim the honor to himself, that he is chosen because of his inherent qualifications. “No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. ’ ’—Heb. 5: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The ones that stand today with the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, are they that are “called and chosen”. (Rev. 17:14) It is the ‘remnant whom Jehovah shall call’. (Joel 2:32) This proves that the remnant are not “the reapers” but are merely witnesses. They have not reaped each other, but God has taken them out of the world to be witnesses to his name. It is these sons of God’s woman or organization that are taught of him and that learn and obey his - commandments. (John 6: 44, 45) This is further proof that no individual holds another in the truth or drives another out of the truth, but that God holds in whosoever proves faithful under the test. The Lord’s angels at the temple gates keep out and refuse to let pass those who are not approved, and gather out and cast out those who become unfaithful and are disapproved, that only the faithful and approved shall be with the Greater Gideon in the fight and in the victory. Therefore Christ Jesus, the Greater Gideon, said concerning his faithful disciples: “Thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.” —John 17: 6, 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Every one of the remaining ten thousand was required to undergo the test which God had named to Gideon. “So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.” —Judg. 7: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The manner in which each one of the ten thousand met and received the test ultimately determined in which class he would be put, whether in the one that went to war or the one that remained behind. Out of the ten thousand that were thus put to the test 9,700 bowed down upon their knees to drink water. In order to do that they necessarily had to cease marching and to get off their feet and bow themselves down while drinking water. They did not keep their feet on the ground, where they belonged. Their chief thought was to get the water into themselves. They foreshadowed a class of consecrated ones that seek personal comfort and that have a large measure of self-confidence and self-reliance, and hence a lack of watchfulness and alertness, and are therefore indifferent to the enemy and would be disposed to boast in themselves if anything in which they were participating prospered. Being off-guard they were unlike those who ‘work out their own salvation with fear [of God] and trembling’. (Phil. 2:12) Such rely more upon “character development” or inherent worth than on faith, which faith is proved by works done in obedience to God’s commandment. ‘They feed themselves without fear.’ (Jude 12) They think it unmanly to publicly read before a company of God’s people an explanation of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> article, which the Lord has provided as food for his people, but insist that a speaker should exhibit his own learning by extemporaneous speech. They get more honor from men in that way. They do not drink water, that is, receive the truth for the purpose of absorbing the truth and using it to the glory of God, but receive it to glorify self. Such fail to realize that a real fight is just at hand and that it will be the greatest fight ever, and that they need and must receive all strength from Jc-hovah God and the Lord Jesus Christ. If they appreciated the real meaning of the battle of the great day of God Almighty they would know that they must at all times be on the alert to hear, to learn, and to obey God’s commandments, and to never rely on self or upon another creature on earth for their safety and for their prosperity and success. The Lord clearly marked out this class by the 9,700 who by their own actions automatically placed themselves in one class.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The other class, which was made up of the three hundred, was entirely different. Jehovah was making a picture here to foreshadow Armageddon, and in this connection had in mind the dogs; and hence the use of dogs as an illustration. “That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.’’ (Ps. 68:23) The little company of three hundred lapped the water as dogs do, “putting their hand to their mouth,” and hence used their arms, illustrating their God-given power to convey the refreshing waters of truth to themselves, and are otherwise described by the prophet as those wiio “with joy . . . draw water out of the wells of salvation”. (Isa. 12:3) They appreciate that all the truth comes from Jehovah as a gracious gift from him, and they are on the alert to receive and profit thereby. That little company of three hundred keep on the march as they scoop up the water in the hollow of the hand and transmit it to the mouth. This foreshadowed alertness and watchfulness on the part of Jehovah's remnant, who clearly discern the enemy and who are not at all in ignorance of his devices. (2 Cor. 2:11) By nature the three hundred may have trembled like others when they saw the enemy, but they were of good courage, because they relied on the Lord God. Likewise in the modern fulfilment of the prophetic picture, probably most of God’s people are by nature cowards, that is to say, they are fearful to engage in mortal combat, and shrink therefrom; but they receiving a commandment of Jehovah God and his great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and knowing that they are right and that Jehovah and his King are back of them, their faith is strong and they go forward. They know that their strength is in the Lord. They know that the battle is Jehovah God’s battle and that the victory is certain and that the faithful and obedient ones will receive full protection and refuge from the Lord, and hence they are strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. They know only one thing, and that is full obedience to the Lord’s commandments. If they relied on any human strength they could not withstand the test.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> As Jesus, the Greater Gideon, said to his faithful disciples, so now he can say and does say to the faithful ones: “Now ye are clean through the word [water] which I have spoken unto you.” And again: “Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it [by the watcr-of-truth tests].”—John 15:2,3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” The faithful three hundred kept active, moving or marching on. They did not get off their feet by stopping and inclining to drink, but kept their eye on the enemy and realized that a fight was just ahead. They did not become negligent and indifferent, but kept their feet on the ground in order that they might think clearly and be very watchful, that they might hear and obey the commandments of Gideon. Likewise now God’s faithful ones keep their feet on the ground and their eye on the enemy and are eager to hear and to obey the commandments of the great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus. They receive the truth in the manner that calls for praise of Jehovah. Their choice by the Lord shows that they drink water for the fight. Jehovah bestows upon them his name and constitutes them his witnesses. They appreciate the fact that the great fight is near. They are always on the alert and on the trek and rejoice to have a part in exalting the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah has gathered his people unto himself by the hand of his angels, who are the reapers working under the direction and command of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah knoweth them that are his. (Alatt. 13: 39; 2 Tim. 2:19) It is these faithful ones that arc with the Greater Gideon and that will be with him at the battle of Armageddon. Concerning those who receive God’s approval at the test it is written: “And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.”—Judg. 7: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> From this point on the 9,700 had no part in the activities which led up to the rout of the Midianites. They no more show in the picture as a distinct company. Having played their part in the picture they disappear therefrom. The five tribes of the Israelites which afterwards took part in the pursuit of the enemy picture something different from what the 9,700 here picture. The little company of three hundred that remained stood by, ready to obey the commandments received, just as the faithful remnant today are ready and willing to obey the commandments which Jehovah gives through the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAISE TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> The fight that was about to take place was for the honor and praise of Jehovah and the vindication of his name, and God had fully equipped his people to perform that service of praise. ‘ ‘ So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.” (Jud</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">g. 7 : 8</span><span class="font5">) It seems reasonable to conclude that all of the 10,01)0 were equipped with trumpets, because they were selected for the praise of Jehovah’s name. The trumpet is an instrument of praise; as it is written: “Praise him with the sound of the trumpet.” (Ps. 150: 3) The trumpet is also used to announce the approach of Jehovah’s conquering army. “God is gone up [to the battle against the enemy, foreshadowing Armageddon] with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.” (Ps. 47:5) Assuming that the entire 10,000 were equipped with trumpets, the greater number thereof, namely 9,700, missed the opportunity of blowing their trumpets to the praise of Jehovah just preceding the battle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> In the antitype all but the remnant likewise fail to avail themselves of the opportunity to blow the trumpet of praise to Jehovah announcing his purpose, the greatness of his name, his war, his King and his kingdom. The company of 9,700 failing in the water test would return to the general camping grounds. They were dismissed from the group by which Jehovah would save Israel. Being once in line for the privileges which they had now missed, they must foreshadow those who were once in line for the kingdom but whom the Lord has gathered out by the hand of his angels, particularly since 1922. Those who have thus been set aside since that time miss all participation in the vindication of Jehovah’s name because of their attitude toward the water, that is, toward present truth. They are rejected from membership in the Lord’s ‘‘faithful servant” class, to whom alone he gives the honor of participating with Christ Jesus in the vindication of his glorious name.—Isa. 42: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The present-day evidence is not lacking to locate such a class. Some who have been favored with the spiritual food from the Lord’s table, foreshadowed by the victuals provided in the picture, and who have been supplied with a trumpet, foreshadowing their equipment to proclaim the praises of Jehovah, have clearly showed themselves out of harmony with the Lord and his provision for them. This they have manifested by such statements as follow: ‘‘The Society is building up an intricate system of belief ”; “ the Society is engaged in a book-selling scheme”; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> continues to repeat what has been formerly said and gives us no food”; ‘‘there is too much said about the vindication of Jehovah’s name”; ‘‘there is not enough said about spirituality”; ‘‘we are becoming slaves to service ”; ‘ ‘ why should we take what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> says when the Lord can use us as well as others? why not anyone in the church give his explanation of prophecy?” These are samples of remarks of criticism of the Lord’s way of conducting his own work and of and concerning the spiritual victuals or food that he provides for them. Such have an opportunity to use their trumpets for praise of Jehovah, but they fail to do so. They fail to sec that it is the Lord that provides the victuals or food upon which his people feed and that the Lord furnishes them opportunity to sing his praises. Certainly too much could not be said about the vindication of Jehovah’s name, because that is the real and paramount question to be settled once and for ever. It pleased Jehovah to cause his prophet Ezekiel to state sixty-four times that ‘they shall know that I am God’. True spirituality does not consist of a sanctimonious appearance, oily words and fair speech, but does consist of absolute and complete devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom. The .faithful ones delight to be the bond servants or slaves of Jehovah God, and they delight to continue to sing forth his praises, because they appreciate that he has brought them out from Satan’s organization of darkness and has given them a place in God’s glorious organization and provided them with means of singing his praises. The ears of these bond servants are deaf to every sound save that of the commandment of Jehovah God and of his great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus.—Ex. 21:6; Isa. 42:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Let it be borne in mind at all times that the modern-day testing by the water of truth, and the eliminating of the disapproved ones from God’s organization, applies to those on the earth who are called to a place in the kingdom. Such a test could not apply to the heavenly or invisible army of the Greater Gideon. There would be no occasion to put to the test those who are already in a spirit organism and in the spirit realm. Furthermore, such invisible ones are not the remnant. That invisible spiritual army, led by the Lord Jesus Christ, is a mighty host, as it is written: ‘‘The [war] chariots of God are twenty thousand [not three hundred], even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.” (Ps. 68:17) ‘‘And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.” (Rev. 9:16) ‘‘Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,” meaning all of his hosts invisible to human eyes. (Jude 14) It is therefore quite certain that the elect three hundred which formed Gideon’s final and approved army pictured the earthly remnant, who are made members of Jehovah’s army under Christ and the assigned duty of which remnant is to sing the praises of Jehovah and his King, and to continually shout: ‘The sword of Jehovah and of his Vindicator,’ that is, ‘‘For Jehovah and for Gideon.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> At the command of Jehovah Gideon retained the three hundred that had successfully passed the test. This shows that Gideon was with his men. This assembly of his little army was on the side of mount Gilboa, which name means ‘‘the bubbling fountain”. As the waters of that mountain bubbled forth, so now God's mountain of truth abundantly bubbles forth or flov. s for the instruction and comfort of those who are wholly devoted to him. Gideon and his little army there assembled may be compared to Christ Jesus, the great Vindicator, with his faithful ones now at Mount Zion. ‘‘And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.”—Rev. 14:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The Midianites encamped along the valley pictured the hosts or multitudes of Satan now gathered in the ‘‘valley of decision”, where the great issue will be finally and completely determined. “Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font5"> valley of concision or threshing].” (Joel 3:14) In another place the Hebrew word here rendered (in the margin) “threshing” is rendered “threshing instrument”. ]Isa. 28:27; Amos 1:3) In this valley the enemy Satan and his organization will be threshed and completely destroyed, to the glory of Jehovah’s name. The prophet of God speaks of the “multitudes in the valley of decision” or threshing and applies the same immediately preceding the time of the battle. The fact that the Lord God is bringing these prophecies to the understanding of his people at the present time is a strong indication that the day for the decision or final settling of the great issue is near, therefore the battle of the great day of God Almighty shall shortly be fought.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COURAGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> Gideon’s little band of three hundred was about to begin the attack, and the forward movement of this little army required great courage on the part of Gideon and of his men. Courage does not mean foolhardiness. It means that a courageous man is one who unhesitatingly goes forward in the face of great danger and relies not upon his own strength but confidently relies upon the power that is backing him up in his forward movement. Gideon and his men were entirely unequal to the enemy in numbers and in actual strength, hence they must rely and did rely upon the supreme strength of Jehovah God, and they showed complete faith in God when obeying his commandments. Jehovah supplies all of the necessary encouragement and assurance and strength to his people now. His little band of witnesses on the earth know that their strength is nothing as compared to the strength of the enemy’s forces, and yet they go forward and continue to sound their trumpets to the praise of Jehovah God; and this they do in the face of the enemy, confidently relying upon the supreme power that backs them up. It is Jehovah God through Christ Jesus that supplies the necessary encouragement and assurance and strength to the remnant. It is for their benefit that it is written: ‘ ‘ There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.” (Deut. 33:26,27) Those faithful ones enjoy the unspeakable privilege of being bond slaves of the Almighty God, and they are under the leadership of Christ Jesus, the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and they are absolutely confident that the Lord will gain the victory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> When darkness surrounds men they need courage to go forward in the face of the enemy. It was nighttime, and therefore very dark, when God commanded Gideon to begin his forward movement. We are now “in the last days”, the ‘time of peril’, and it is a time when there is great darkness. “For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:2) Jehovah God causes his light to shine upon his people, and in his strength they go forward. The presumption must be indulged that Gideon was reclining on his bed in his tent when the Lord gave him commandment to arise and make ready for the fight. “And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.” (Judg. 7:9) It is Jehovah who decides the time and place of battle and when the enemy shall be destroyed. That is a time of darkness on the enemy. The outposts would report to the commander of the Midianites the smallness of Gideon’s army, and hence the enemy would look with contempt upon the little army of Gideon and the Midianites would lie down to sleep when darkness came, and evi n the outposts or night watchmen would be careless.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Comparing the conditions that existed at the time of the picture with the present-day events, it is to be seen that the multitudes which go to make up Satan s organization look with contempt upon Jehovah’s little band of witnesses and hence the enemy is comparatively at ease, resting and off-guard. Although the enemy has had full notice from Jehovah, they continue to regard with contempt Jehovah’s witnesses and continue to rely upon their own strength. They may be disturbed somewhat when hearing the message, but quickly reassure themselves that because of their great numbers and power no evil can come to them. Jehovah had permitted the Midianites to invade the land of Israel that he might destroy them in his own due time. Now he permits Satan and his forces, under the immediate leadership of Gog, to invade the land of his covenant people and to commit overt acts against the faithful ones, that the enemy may be taken and destroyed at the time and place which Jehovah God selects. (Ezek. 39:1-5) To be sure, Jehovah God could have destroyed the enemy in the daytime just as well as at nighttime, but we must bear in mind that there at Mount Gilboa he was making a picture to foreshadow, to instruct, to aid and comfort his anointed people in this time of peril, just preceding the battle of Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Human creatures, being weak by nature, have fear of a powerful foe, and for that reason must have courage in order to face the enemy in battle. Having commanded Gideon to arise and go down to the enemy hosts, God further said to Gideon: “But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host.” (Judg. 7:10) That statement to Gideon does not mean that the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, fears the enemy, but this part of the prophetic picture is particular!}' for the benefit of the faithful remnant, who are members of the Christ. The tendency on the part of the remnant to fear has been largely cast out since 1922, and they arc less fearful today than they were ten years ago. The casting out of such fear has been due to the goodness of the Lord in continually giving assurance to the faithful by telling them of the things that were written long ago and now made clear for their comfort, aid and hope. (Rom. 15:4) The facts show that when Gideon did begin the attack on the enemy he was entirely fearless, and this condition of fearlessness and the complete courage picture the boldness, courage and complete confidence of the remnant of Jehovah under Christ Jesus, and show that they rely wholly and confidently upon the Lord to gain the victory at Armageddon. There is no doubt in the mind of the remnant as to result of that fight, and hence they boldly march on, shouting the praises of Jehovah and his Vindicator. To be sure, the Greater Gideon knows that he is going to win the fight, and those who are with him, being called, chosen and faithful, are also certain of the victory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> &quot;When Gideon went down near the enemy to reconnoiter he was accompanied by Phurah his servant. The servant’s name means “foliage”, being bright green like the new growth in the early spring. Phurah was undoubtedly one of the three hundred, and therefore in the picture he represents members of the remnant, some of whom first learn or hear the interpretation of the prophecies and then report the same to the others. That reconnoitering by two men in the nighttime required courage on their part, just as now the faithful remnant must be courageous in going about their work of locating the enemy and learning what God would have them to do and then doing it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MESSENGERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>S1</sup> Jehovah in his own good way and in his own time conveys his message to his servants. He even uses members of the enemy organization at times to speak words for the benefit of the anointed servant class. It would be an easy matter for Jehovah to cause his angel to put in the mind of a member of the enemy organization the words that he would have him to speak, and then cause him to utter those words to the intent that God’s faithful ones might hear them. In harmony with this conclusion God told Gideon to go down and listen in on the enemy outposts. “And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.” (Judg. 7:11) What our enemies have to say is not material to us, but what Jehovah God says is of vital importance to us; and when he causes the enemy to utter a message that we might hear, it should be heeded because the message is from the Lord. The message which Gideon and Phurah were to hear certainly was from Jehovah, even though it was spoken by the mouth of a member of the enemy organization. The angels are God’s messengers, whom he uses to carry out his purpose, lie had sent one of his angels to Gideon, and now he would use an angel to cause Gideon to hear another message spoken by a r: n.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The question has been foolishly propounded: “Does </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> serve as a medium of instruction for the angels ? ” Certainly not. Without a doubt the Lord uses his angels to cause the truth to be published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who hear and give heed to the message of truth from the Lord and render obedience thereto are thus a spectacle or theater to others, both men and angels, who observe that these faithful ones are maintaining their integrity toward God. (1 Cor. 4: 9) This does not at all mean that the witnesses of Jehovah on earth are instructing the angels, but surely the angels would look with pleasure upon men on earth who are maintaining their integrity towards Jehovah and thereby proving Satan to be a liar. Certainly God guides his covenant people by using the holy angels to convey his message to them. “I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.” (Ps. 32:8) “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. ’ ’—Ps. 34: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Seeing that Gideon had previously asked Jehovah for more knowledge and understanding, his prayer must have been like this: ‘Lord, increase my faith.’ (Luke 17:5) Jehovah surely answered that prayer and gave Gideon full assurance before he sent him into the battle, and thereby Gideon’shands were “strengthened to go down unto the host”. It is even so today with God’s faithful remnant on earth. Jehovah is not rushing his remnant to the battle before they are made strong and courageous in the Lord. For some time prior to the battle God causes his remnant to be instructed as to the meaning of his prophetic pictures long ago made and which he caused to be made for that very purpose. He has builded up his people in faith, love and unity, and they are “strengthened . . . by his spirit in the inner man”. (Eph. 3:16) Tl.e faithful, courageous ones do not rely upon themselvc nor upon any other creature, but wholly rely upon the Lord. “Blessed is the man whose strength is m thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion. They go from strength to strength; every one of them ap-peareth before God in Zion.” (Ps. 84:5,7, A.ZLV.) Now we are in the “day of Jehovah” and he is instructing the faithful remnant preparatory to the battle of his great day, and he is holding them in his hand and using them for his purposes. “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, and for a spirit of judgment to him [Judge Gideon, the Greater] that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them [Gideon’s three hundred] that turn the battle to the gate.”—Isa. 28: 5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSPIRATORS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The Midianites and their allies had formed a conspiracy to destroy God’s covenant people, the Israelites, and they were about ready to strike the Israelites down. That his covenant people might be properly informed and assured of the result, God sent Gideon and his servant to hear the message from Him that would be spoken by another whom God would use, and which message would disclose to Gideon and his men the exact situation. That motley crowd had been gathered and brought to the land of the Israelites by Satan and his officers, and now’ they were sleeping in unclean beds prepared for them by God’s great adversary. Likewise Satan at the present time, operating through his unclean spirits, has gathered all the nations against God’s anointed for the purpose of carrying out his conspiracy to destroy the anointed of the Lord. This conspiracy has been formed and is carried forward against the anointed of Jehovah for the purpose of preventing them from becoming a nation, that Satan may have everything his own way. (Ps.83:1-11) It is well known that the visible ones in this wicked conspiracy hypocritically claim before men to be God’s chosen ones and to have been delegated by him to rule the world. Now the wicked conspirators say, as stated by the psalmist: ‘ ‘ Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.” (Ps. 83:12) The Gideon picture exactly represents the conditions which exist at the present time, and this is further proof that that picture was made and recorded for the special benefit of the remnant, that they might be courageous and strong in hope at the present time. Especially the religious element of the Devil’s organization now shows its boldness in announcing its determination to take charge of the affairs of the world and to destroy God’s anointed people. The boldness of the Roman hierarchy in the land that has long been known as ‘‘the land of the free and the home of the brave” is further proof that the day of battle draws near.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> Looking now again at the picture, we see that the Midianites and their coconspirators outnumbered Gideon’s band by 400 to 1. Likewise today the enemy forces arrayed against God’s anointed ones on earth constitute a mighty multitude as against the small number of Jehovah’s witnesses. The enemy fully intends to attack and completely destroy all of Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth. By oppressive and coercive means the combined elements of Satan’s tools expect to take complete possession of the earth, and their assault upon God’s people will be like the onrushing of a mighty storm.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Concerning Gog, who leads the forces of Satan, Jehovah’s prophet wrote: ‘‘Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm; thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and many people with thee, To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.” (Ezek. 38: 9,12) The camels of the Midianites, described to Gideon as being without number, picture the numberless instruments and appliances made ready in these last days to battle against the forces of the Lord. Men of all nations of “Christendom” agitate the manufacture of great quantities of arms and munitions and other instruments of destruction in order to be prepared against the assault of their enemies. This whole matter is engineered by Satan, and the real purpose of which is to bring all people into complete subjection to a few, that these, under the immediate direction and command of Satan, may control all things and destroy everything that is for God and his kingdom and thus gain the victory for Satan and determine the issue in his behalf. Without a vision of these truths all the people would be turned away from God and go into destruction. Truly it is written in the Scriptures: “Where there is no vision [of the truth], the people perish.” (Prov. 29:18) God has given his anointed people a vision of his truth and has made and constituted them his witnesses to declare the truth to others, and such witnesses he gives as a light to the people of good will, that those who have made a covenant with him to do his will might know’ what course to take. For that very reason he discloses the meaning of his prophetic pictures today and sends forth his witnesses to proclaim his message of truth that others may hear and know’.—Isa. 42: 6, 7 ; 43:10,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3T</sup> The fact that Jehovah disclosed to Gideon the great host of the enemy and their camels, representing their instruments of warfare, foreshadows that he will disclose to his anointed people at this time the truths that they need to know concerning the enemy and his purpose. Therefore there is now’ laid upon the shoulders of the remnant the great responsibility to hear and to obey the commandments of the Greater Gidi &lt;&gt;n and to go forth and with boldness give instruction to the people concerning God and his kingdom. They have no alternative. They must be Jehovah’s witnesses, and hence they must hear and obey Jehovah’s great prophet, Christ Jesus, the Greater Gideon ■ and their failure or refusal to so obey his commandments in proclaiming the message of truth before the great battle comes would result in the destruction of God's anointed ones. This is plainly set forth as the position of God’s people at the present time.—Matt. 24:14; Acts 3:20-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The hour of battle was approaching, and Gideon and his men must be informed before going into action. For this purpose Gideon and his servant approached the enemy camp to reconnoiter and find out the facts. Likewise today, the battle of Armageddon draw’s near and God’s anointed people must be informed before that fight takes place, and they must pass this information on to others, and particularly to those of good will, who desire to know and to do the will of God. For this purpose the faithful ones of the remnant are now directed by the Lord to carefully consider the position of the enemy and to hear the message from the Lord as to what they may expect to take place and what the Lord w ill have them to do. Gideon and his servant drew near the camp of the enemy. They heard a message spoken. What was the meaning of that message then, and what is the application and what the meaning thereof now as applied to God’s people ?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>’'CHRISTENDOM’S” HYPOCRISIES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">OMEONE will say, ‘Was not the Christian church organized by Jesus and his apostles, and are not these clergymen of “Christendom” still holding to the Christian church?’ The reply to this must be that Jesus and his apostles did organize the Christian church on earth, and for some time thereafter that organized body of men called Christians followed the teachings of Jesus. The church was then pure, and the apostle refers to the same as a pure virgin, espoused to Christ. Writing to the church the apostle Paul said; “Bear with me. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” (2 Cor. 11:1-3) Later that organization of the church was overreached by Satan through his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also true that the Israelites took the name of Jehovah God, and were his covenant people and agreed to do his will. They were a prophetic people foretelling the Christian people of God. Because of the unfaithfulness of the Israelites God withdrew his favor from them, and they became the captives to the great world power Babylon. What happened to that people was prophetic, and foretold what would happen, and what did come to pass, with those who control the organization called the “Christian Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many centuries ago the religion named the “Christian religion”, and which was organized, ceased to be the true religion because the leaders and principal ones in the flock thereof fell away and became captive to Babylon, which is the Devil’s organization. Their unfaithfulness to God and to Christ was the reason therefor. Satan therefore overreached and corrupted the organization and in due time controlled it. Satan blinded the people and drew them away from the truth of God’s Word and from the study thereof, and since that time the organization has been Christian in name only, having within its fold some good, honest people, and many hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘But,’ asks another, ‘surely it cannot be denied that the religion of “Christendom” holds to the name of Christ and of God, and publicly calls upon the name of God and of Christ and prays to God in public, and is not their religion therefore still the true Christian religion?’ To such the answer is that Satan’s method is always fraudulent. He induced men in the very dawn of man’s history to hypocritically call themselves by the name of the Lord, and he has been doing that time and again since. In the earliest records of the book Genesis, chapter four, verse twenty-six, according to the reading of the note in the margin, it says: “And to Seth [the son of Adam], to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord [Jehovah].” The Israelites were God’s chosen and covenant people and they called themselves by the name of the Lord, and because of their unfaithfulness God said to them: “This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart [devotion] far from me.” (Isa. 29:13) To the same effect Paul wrote a prophecy concerning the very time in which we are now living, in which he said: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As men in the days of Enos were hypocrites and called themselves by the name of God; as the Pharisees and other religious leaders of the Jews called themselves by the name of God and were hypocritical (Matt. 23:12-35); even so the religionists of “Christendom” are hypocritical, because they claim to be God’s people and take the name of Christ and call themselves Christians but by their very words and course of action deny that they serve God and follow Christ. Thus the old “whore”, as the Scriptures call “Babylon”, which is Satan’s organization, has defiled and debauched that which is called “organized Christianity”. Satan accomplished this wicked result by his fraud and deception, and by turning the people away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the Lord came to his spiritual temple (which event occurred in the year 1918) many students of the Scriptures believed and taught that the Catholic system is “Babylon” and “the mother of harlots”. In that they were in error. Babylon is Satan’s organization and gives birth to every wicked organization. Babylon, being the harlot and mother of harlots, is the one that causes other organizations to commit harlotry. When the early church fell away from God and was seduced by the Devil and became a part of his organization, that organization then called the church took the name of the “mother”, that is, Babylon, as well as the name of the father, who is the Devil. The Catholic church became a part of the Devil’s organization; and also the Protestant church, when it fell away and joined hands with Satan’s organization and made an alliance therewith and thereby became guilty of adultery. Leaders of both the Catholic and Protestant systems were blinded and led away into wickedness by Satan’s fraud and deception. In both Catholic and Protestant church organizations there have been and are now honest and sincere persons; but they have -failed to walk in the light of Christ, and therefore Satan has blinded them to the truth. Many of these are crying for relief because they are, as the Scriptures designate them, “prisoners” in the Babylonish or devilish organization, and the Lord has given his promise that in due time these shall be delivered.—Ps. 146: 7; Isa. 61:1; Ps. 102:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy leaders of “Christendom” now bring into their pulpits politicians and financiers to teach the people, well knowing that such would-be teachers have no understanding of or faith in God and Christ Jesus. They also welcome in their pulpits the Jewish rabbis, who deny the blood of Christ. They also have in their pulpits the teachers of Hinduism, Buddhists, and “Christian Scientists”, so called, and all manner religious leaders; and they tell the people to ‘believe anything they like, because they can be saved by one religion as well as by another’. Because of their attempt to follow a way of salvation contrary to the Lord God’s provision, there has resulted confusion in all the organized systems of so-called ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been Babylon, the Devil’s organization, working by and through the Devil religion, that has brought the politicians and the rulers of the world into the fold of so-called “organized religion” and caused these rulers to commit fornication with that unholy system. (Rev. 18:9) It has been this same Devil’s organization called Babylon that has opened her foul arms and received the commercial giants and profiteers and merchants of the earth into her fold, and has bidden them to partake of her illicit delicacies. These have been made the principal ones in the religious flock. (Rev. 18:3; Jer. 25: 34) The history of ancient Babylon therefore clearly and prophetically foretold the present religious condition of so-called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Word of God Satan’s organization is called “the world” because it consists of an invisible and a visible part, and the nations and peoples have for centuries been under Satan’s control and therefore form a part of the world. For this reason it is designated in the Scriptures as the “evil world”. (Gal. 1:4) Satan is the prince or “god of this world”. (John 14: 30; 2 Cor. 4:3, 4) God caused the record of ancient Egypt to be made as a prophecy foretelling the conditions that would obtain on earth at the time of the coming of Christ and his kingdom. Therefore ancient Egypt more particularly magnified the commercial and military part of the modern satanic organization. Jesus Christ was crucified in the world, and the place is therefore mentioned as “Egypt” in the symbolical scriptures of the book of Revelation (11:8). There it says: “And their dead bodies [the bodies of God’s witnesses] shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called . . . Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.” This is another proof that ancient Egypt was Satan’s organization and that his organization still persists on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Egypt was noted for her wealth and for her military power. The wealth of the world was never so great as it is today, particularly in the nations called “Christendom”. There are a few millionaires and billionaires, but there are hundreds of millions of paupers tn “Christendom”. The latter are oppressed by the ultrarich, even as the poor of ancient Egypt were oppressed. It is the commercial power that makes wars, and this in turn opens the way for them to greatly increase their material wealth. All the great transportation systems; all the great banks and financial institutions; all the light and power corporations; all the great buildings in the cities; and almost all the food-producing lands, and nearly all the material wealth of the world today, are owned and controlled by the great commercial giants of “Christendom”. All the great battleships, submarines, aircraft, explosives, guns, and other weapons of war, are held and owned by the rich governmental powers of ‘ ‘ Christendom”. Does this great material wealth, and do these instruments of destruction, form a part of God’s organization? Docs Jehovah God’s organization, of w’hich Christ is the Head, have any need of such weapons and instruments of destruction? It is so manifest that all these are owned by Satan’s organization that no one should doubt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The commercial giants of earth today accept the so-called “Christian religion” because they can pay the purchase price thereof, and they hope to be saved thereby from dire penalties that might be brought upon them for wrongdoing. By reason of the Devil’s fraudulent religion the merchants of earth have waxed rich and enjoyed many delicacies. They have paid for religious protection and consolation, but the time rapidly approaches when they will awake to the fact that they have been duped by the Devil’s arrangement or organization named Babylon, and particularly by the religious part thereof. Then woe to hypocritical religion in ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ 1</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FLATTERY: A SNARE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">MONG the characters that appear in the picture found in the book of Job is a man whose name ' was Elihu. He was related to Abraham. (Gen. 22: 20, 21) He had faith in God like unto Abraham. He was the son of Barachel, which name means ‘ ‘ who bends the knee before God”. The name Elihu means “God of him; my God is he; he is my God himself”. He was a young man. He was one of the silent audience that sat by and listened to the speech of the three professed friends of Job as well as that of Job. Throughout that discussion he said not a word until the three professed wise men had ceased their babble. “So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.”—Job 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Elihu listened to the discussion between Job and the three men, he became indignant against Job because Job justified himself rather than extolling Jehovah God. Elihu’s indignation boiled against the professed friends of Job because they had condemned Job and had not answered Job’s arguments. They exalted themselves and made their own self-righteousness appear. Elihu did not condemn Job as the three professed friends did. While he did not approve the action of Job in speaking of his own righteousness, yet the words of Elihu offered, as an extenuation, that Job was ignorant of the real situation. He said: “Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.”—Job 34:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this Job pictures many men of honesty of purpose who have never been able to understand that their sufferings were due to their own willful wrongdoing, because of being conscious of the fact that they had tried to do right. Likewise they have never been able to harmonize the claims of “Christendom”, so called, with a God of justice and love. They have been willing to submit their ease to God, having faith that he would do to them that which was best. They have therefore rejected the doctrines of ecclesiasticism, and properly so, because as honest men they could see that such doctrines were not in harmony with the all-wise, just and loving Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elihu magnified Jehovah. As a young man he manifested respect for the gray-haired savants who had spoken before him, but he used no words of flattery because of their high standing. lie began his speech in this manner: “ I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. But there is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. Great men are not always wise; neither do the aged understand judgment. Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. I will speak, that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips, and answer. Let me nut, I pray you, accept any man’s person; neither let me give flattering titles unto man. For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.”—Job 32: 6-13, 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The praise and exaltation of men is never pleasing to God. In this connection the reader is reminded that the prominent men of the Devil’s visible organization have always been men who exalted themselves and their fellow men. The whole period of “Christendom” has been an age of hero worship. Visit any of the art galleries of Europe or America and you will see the tangible evidence of this statement. In every celebrated painting where the power of a nation or government is shown, there stands forth prominently in the picture the great warrior; by his side the great statesman; and with the two the clergyman, indicated by his garb and his sanctimonious face. The manifest purpose is to overawe the populace and impress them with the greatness of these men, and to cause the people to pay homage to the great leaders of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let it be understood also that such celebrated paintings are further proof of the close union between the financial power, the warrior, the statesmen and the clergy. It is another tangible proof that these are the visible agencies of Satan’s organization. It should be expected, therefore, that they would laud and praise men of their own organization. Why should they do this? The answer is that it has always been the purpose of the Devil to cause men to worship any creature, that man might be turned away from Jehovah God and his devotion be given to others than Jehovah God. Let it be set down as a rule to which there is no exception, that where there is adulation and praise and worship heaped upon men, such is the result of the subtle influence of the Devil to turn men away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists have fallen into this trap at all times. The Jews have magnified the names of their rabbis and exalted them. The members of the Catholic church have exalted their clergy and even called them “saints”. The members of the Protestant ecclesiastical systems have exalted their clergy and hailed them as great and mighty men. It is true that this has been due largely to ignorance on the part of the people. It is also true that that ignorance has been induced by Satan the enemy. Many Christians who have allied themselves with neither Catholics nor Protestants have also exalted men to their own injury. It may be laid down as a safe rule that where a person professes to be devoted to God and at the same time is exalting any man or men he will have great difficulty in standing the test and proving his complete faithfulness to God. The majority of such fall away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elihu assigned the reason for the disastrous results to those who worship men. He said: “Let me not . . . give flattering titles unto man. For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.” (Job 32:21,22) His words arc really prophetic. Many have been taken away from the Lord because of flattering words. Many have fallen because they have been willing to receive words of flattery heaped upon them. But one might ask, Why would God take away one who flatters men? The answer is quite apparent when we understand the great controversy that has long existed between Jehovah and the Devil. Let it be kept in mind at all times that Satan the Devil has tried and is trying to alienate all creation from God. Let it also be kept in mind that Jehovah has said, ‘There is no other God besides me.’ Remember that no creature can get life except by and through Jehovah. Therefore if a man who claims to be a servant of the Lord would give flattering titles to men, and laud and magnify men and make heroes of men, he would be following the lead and the instruction of Satan the Devil, and not following the Lord and being obedient to the Woid of God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark13"></a>MEMORIAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE date for the celebration of the memorial to the name of Jehovah God and to the sacrifice of Christ Jesus is determined in this manner: From the rising of the new moon nearest to the vernal equinox, which marks the first day of the first month, count fourteen days. (Exodus 12:1-6) According to astronomical calculations the moon rises at least 16 hours before it can be seen with the natural eye of man. In the time of Moses the calculation was made from the hour he could see the moon with the naked eye, and that is the proper manner for us to count the time. This year (called A.D. 1935) begins on the 4th day of April, and the fourteenth day, to wit, after 6 p.m. of April 17, is the proper time for the celebration of the Memorial. Jerusalem time is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth, therefore, will assemble after 6 p.m. (according to the time whore each company is assembled) and celebrate the Memorial. For many years it has been the custom for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to publish the Scriptural reason for celebrating the Memorial in order to afford its readers opportunity to study the same before the date &lt;&nbsp;f celebration. This year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> will not publish such an article, for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font5"> contains a more detaile 1 explanation of the Memorial than </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtowt r </span><span class="font5">could carry at one issue. All who are devoted to Jehovah God and his King should carefully and prayerfully study chapters two and three of that book, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> beginning at page 26 and ending rt. page 120. Each company should arrange for such study to be had once each week, and the study should begin in time to thoroughly go over the pages above mentioned before the date of the Memorial. Such careful study will require approximately eight weeks, and where it is possible it should begin eight weeks before the 17th of April and continue each week. Oue person should be selected to preside as chairman and conduct the entire series of studies. One person who can read well should be appointed to do the reading at such studies. The study should be conducted in the following manner, to wit: The chairman should call on the reader to read one paragraph at a time, and then entertain questions on that paragraph. Appropriate scriptures may be read and considered wilh each paragraph. The chairman should not talk too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At these studies questions may be propounded by anyone in the company, and all answers should be brief and should be confined strictly to the question under consideration. Avoid side issues which may lead to confusion. Each study meeting should be opened and closed with prayer, and everyone present should be diligent to ascertain the true meaning of the subject matter under consideration. If the studies are conducted in this manner by all the companies throughout the earth, every one of the anointed will have the same matter in mind and may expect the blessings of the Lord on his efforts. All of the anointed should attend these studies, and all others of good will are privileged to attend and participate in the studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then on the 17th day of April, after 6 p.m., let each company of the anointed assemble and celebrate the Memorial. In doing so, use unleavened bread and real red wine. Unfermented grape juice or raisin juice will not meet the requirements. The Lord and the apostles used real wine, and we should follow their lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sitteth as king for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment; and he will judge the world m righteousness, he will minister to the people in uprightness. JEHOVAH also will l.e a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, JEHOVAH, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
